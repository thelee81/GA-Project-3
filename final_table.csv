t3_dlcc3k,DreamingIndianBot,dreamt about her last night ,it s been around   year since we broke up  it was mostly my fault for not being a good boy friend  she tried her best for   months  best of my life  to keep things together but there was not much common in life except the fact that we loved each other    we broke up last year same day  somehow she moved ahead while i am still stuck with this life  not even a day has passed when i didn t missed her    now she has a boyfriend  they both are in love with each other so much that they got matching tattoos with each other names  maybe they are more happy together than we were     ever since she moved on  i am in depression type feeling  can t confirm  because i don t know what other feels  but for me it hurts  now nearly every night i dream of her and in all dreams she leaves me in the end  no matter how the dream proceeds  the end is always she leaving me   tried my best to move on  but couldn t  tried alcohol  drugs etc all  i haven t shared these feelings with anyone  and i don t think i will ever share  mostly because people don t care  even if i share it will somehow make me look pathetic looser  somehow writing it here  i don t know if anyone understands me  i know people here don t care and will ignore this  that s ok because no one has enough time for a looser like me      ,0
t3_dlnedd,CloudNoin,no hope,in the grand scheme of things  i dont want to live anymore  one semester of college and i m already done with it  sure  why not take a break  but after one semester  my family would think im a loser and this will only affirm it  plus what would i do  work the minimum wage job i already have  if i try to go for an associate s in something  would that even work   i want to fucking kill myself  i m not cut out for life and that s the truth  i m sick and tired of having hope then losing is  it s an endless cycle  i m done  sure family and friends would be upset but they ll get over it  i mean why is death a hard concept to conceive  i m dead  and that s it  and i cant really talk about this with anyone because it s just  what will the other person do  i appreciate and support and love but it s just  what can you really say to a person who s suicidal  plus  i dont want to bring them down with me  i dont see any reason to live  i already see my future as absolute shit  i m just a hopeless screw up who shouldn t have been born ,1

t3_dlb2t6,MineCraft_Queen,i am on the verge of killing myself ,i ve been through a lot which i am not going to explain all here  just my life gets shitter by the day and i feel like i have no purpose  i lost my support that were my friends because i was too much  no one beside one person in my life knows because i mask my emotions in public  and that person left me to because  i have a temper sometimes and don t pick up on social cues  to quote him  his reasoning is shit when he knew i depended on him for most of my support  i am back to planning my death and will probably be dead or injured in two weeks  life is shit ,1
t3_dl6cha,letitfckingsnow,  years ago today,  years ago today  i nearly killed myself  i was delusional and incredibly depressed  i was involuntarily hospitalized  put on a   month commitment  and given my most updated diagnosis to date  bipolar i disorder    i did not hit rock bottom until november  after that  it was an extremely slow rebuilding process  most of the relationships in my life had been destroyed  my own psychiatrist told me not to go back to school  not to try to finish college  i said   fuck that   and i finished college  i worked in my field  psychology  for two years  in the interim  i moved across the country on my own  i am now in graduate school for mental health counseling and i do not take any medications  i have never been so happy with my life or had a clearer picture of who i am or what my purpose is  i am literally grateful every fucking day and it s so stupid  i still can t believe i m here   i am not saying that you should all believe it will get better  because when i was in such a dark place  i thought   only the lucky ones   get better and i was too fundamentally flawed to be grouped with them  i thought i wasn t fit for life on earth  i was mad at anyone who would told me just to hold on because it would get better    like i said    you don t have to believe me  i probably wouldn t have believed me  but i was the last fucking person i would have expected to get better  so i feel compelled to share my story in case it gives anyone an inkling of hope  whatever you can do to stay alive  please do it  because i promise things will get better    even when you least expect them to     lt  ,1
t3_dl88nq,bja98,the same thing happens to me all the time and i m sick and tired of it,i ve never been a social guy  i m quite shy and never had lots of friends  i m really bad at talking to people and opening up to them  i tell you this because it s really important to understand the situation    so back in      i had a crush on a girl  we were close friends  but i started to feel more  i told her  and she rejected me obviously  it really hurt me but we still tried to be friends  it didn t work out well  we stopped talking and caring about each other  i was very depressed because as i told you  it s really hard for me to let people close to me  so obviously losing her was a big trauma  it took me about     years to fully accept that we are not friends anymore   but something started again  i started to talk more and more to a girl  we became friends  and then later  best friends  we knew ecerything about each other and we talked every day  literally every day  it didn t took me long to fall in love  since he had a boyfriend at that time i kept my feelings to myself  i didn t want to stand between them  all i wanted is her to be happy  and not to mention i didn t want this friendship to result in the same thing as before  it was hard  but i kept it in  fast forward to february       and she somehow found out that i had feelings for her  she stopped talking to me  one day everything was fine  and the next day she acted like we never knew each other  she didn t even tell me what was going on  but deep down i knew that somehow she found out my secret  i was shocked that i lost another loved one  another friend  i cant tell you how much i ve cried  how much i thought about ending my life because i only saw darkness everywhere and i wanted it to end  because the one person that i loved from the bottom of my heart  left me  some people say that it s even harder to lose a really close friend than a girlfriend boyfriend  but with a help of a an old friend of mine  after almost   years i managed to climb out of this  and i felt good  it was hard  really hard  but i was happy again somehow    fast foward to       i can t believe it  but the same thing seems to be happening again  for the  rd time  there is this girl that i got to know over the internet  we started talking  i m not saying we are close friends  but we talk regularly and i really enjoy her company  after a long time  i met someone that i could possibly open up to  as i said  it s really hard for me  so if i get close to someone it show that the person is really  really important to me and i trust him her  a couple days ago we were chatting about random stuff  but suddenly she stopped responding to me  i tried to ask her what s up but she didn t answer   since then  she doesn t like my pictures  i know it sounds kinda stupid  but she was almost always the first one to put a heart on my posts on fb and instagram   i don t know what to do now  i don t know what i did wrong  but i m just so afraid of losing her that i already cried myself to sleep last night  i don t want it to happen to me again  because this time  i m not sure i ll ever get up    honestly  i m at a point where i just want to go away to a deserted island and live the rest of my life there  without people  just me   thank you for reading it  it really means a lot  i had to write this down because i don t really have anyone to talk to  ,0

t3_dlu2vn,QGraphics,can t talk to anyone   rant,recently i ve been thinking about suicide more than ever before  like i spent the entirety of history class thinking about the ways i could end it all   only crush knows i m suicidal and my parents  kinda  they knew i was suicidal when i was younger but they probably think that phase passed  but i don t want to burden her  i just straight up asked her if she cares and she said no but i think she s just being nice because she rejected me   anyway i was already suicidal because i saw no meaning in life and i have no hope in humanity  what pushed me further along the road was my  friends  secretly hanging out behind my back  i decided to cut them off and now they want me back  fuck off  they insulted me and belittled at every turn and now i m gone all of a sudden i m a  valued  friend  i m convinced that they secretly hate each other they just don t want to say it like i did  they literally rant about each other behind each other s backs  i feel so lonely now that i left them  it just makes me emptier than i was before but at least i don t have to listen to their dumb asses  honestly i think i would have ended it by now if it weren t for my crush  i lied and said  i m not gonna do it   i m gonna fucking do it at some point probably  all it takes is the right tool  a little bit of courage  and something to push me over into the abyss  thanks for reading ,1

t3_dlegos,lfcanfield,i tried to get an appointment and made an effort but let down,i have been thinking about getting some help for some time now as i wake up every morning not knowing what to do and suicide thoughts    i decided i will get up early and call the doctors to get some of them nice anti depressant drugs that make you num in the head  even though im total against drugs  but thought fuck it because if i commit suicide then it doesn t matter   so i rang the doctors    times line was busy each time so i got out the house and walked there only to be told all appointments have been took  i said well its an emergency she said you will have to ring tomorrow and try to get through or come back tomorrow and i thought to myself ill just go home and slit my wrists then    its actually quite funny now that ive calmed down a bit  oh well another day of debating to end it or not ,1

t3_dlg9oz,trnscndcalypso,too afraid to do it myself,i cross the road as i go to school and hope a careless driver runs me over   i sit at the back of a moving car at night and fantasize about a truck slamming onto my side of the car   i carelessly use knives and cutters and scissors to make an  accident  of cutting through an artery and bleeding all over the place   i barely eat throughout the week in hopes of starving myself so i could be sick and pass away   i go out in public and imagine a fault in the engineering as i get crushed by a structure   i disregard my health and stay outside in hopes of catching a flu or illness so i could go through natural means instead   i walk over a bridge and think of it crashing down  destroying me with it   i pray to whatever god that exists puts me in the wrong place at the wrong time   i go to sleep hoping it s my last memory of being alive as i fail to wake up the next day   i want to die but i m too afraid to do it myself    ,0

t3_dkumct,Cibeleee,a never ending slumber in the mountains ,i just turned     and things have never been easy   i really owe it to the nonchalant friends  the stubborn  stuck in the past family  and the unempathetic lovers   i have been reminded left and right that my wants and needs will never be put above anothers  that my mental illness is a plague  something that makes me so damaged  its irreparable  that i will never be anyone s priority  not my mother s  my father s  my sisters or brother  not a partner  not a life long friend  no ones  i am just a burden  i belong to no one  and i m starting to come to peace with that   and if you argue life is meant to be lived happily and contentedly without the intention of love and connections  that is bullshit  you cant live an amazing life  loving  your pathetic irreparable self    but before i go off on a tangent  i just wanted to state that i ll be disapearing   i will be going to the west coast  i m going to stay in the mountains  where i will be consuming   mg of ativan  and a bottle of whiskey   it s quite pathetic  the life i lived  so i decided i will be using the upwards of      worth of gear i invested in to backpack in the mountains until i can t anymore  i have another      in cash that i will take with me   after my money runs out  i will find myself under the starts  in the cool winter breeze  and sleeping most peacefully ,1

t3_dlk7ly,CozyEpicurean,i should be fine,but i m not  usually depression comes and goes for me and doesnt have much staying power but this time it s not  and yes i know the initial trigger and i ve made my peace with it but i still feel so close to the edge  and my partner doesnt seem to understand though they re trying  when they dont understand that you can be sad without a cause it feels invalidating because that most of my depressive symptoms throughout the last half decade and some change    i m stable but i m not happy  and yes there are things that arent ideal but i dont think fixing those will fix me  i know i ve got to fix myself  i just feel pathetic and lazy  i should be stronger emotionally  the really dark thoughts creep back in some  i wish i could escape and not feel and i know that s not a solution  but my mind feels so tired right now  theres so much i need to do and so much i want to do but starting is hard and my job feels stagnant  pointless  and i feel like i m just wasting so much time and i feel guilty  i feel close to crying but i m also too numb and i cant cry at work  i want to crawl in a hole and stop having so many emotions ,0

t3_dldxuc,Petery007,how to get over someone ,i have been diagnosed with depression for half my life  recently it has been the worst it has ever been since i am so lonely and isolated  i met someone who i really liked and developed a crush for  i told her about it and she said she were too busy for a relationship and she wanted to stay friends  a few months later to now i have been seeing her and speaking with her a lot less  i have been trying to move on but i have no one to turn to for a friend  i was on bumble swiping through people and there she was and it was such shit feeling  i honestly cannot go more than a few hours without thinking about the whole thing and it is destroying me  what do i do ,0
t3_dlbiej,Khostan1,drowning,like my title says  i m drowning     i don t know what to do anymore  or how to even keep going  this last year and especially last few months  have been horrible     i really don t know why i m here anymore or why i even try to keep going  i was kicked out of home by family  because i  a white male  have fallen in love with a black girl  who is my world  and as you will see  will never be backseat to anyone or choice i make   i asked her to move in with me after we dated for a few months       and she said yes  we had been living together for almost a year when my family  gma owns the property  i own the house  pretty much forced me to move out because  instead of coming to me like adults  they went to my gma and bitched and loaned etc  until i made the choice for her  she is extremely old  had stints in her legs  takes blood thinning meds  and suffers from stress  due ofc to family  i moved to avoid causing her anymore pain and hospital visits    after we moved  she asked if she could take time for herself  to figure out what she wants to do and also figure out a few other things  i said ok because i want her to be happy and if that is what does it  then i will  i miss her and have not slept well without her since  and it s been hard  after that  i lost my job due to a conniving co worker  i really started struggling then     when i lived back home  i payed for both mine and my cousins power bills   after i moved  they broke into my house and stole a lot of very expensive computer and gaming equipment  as well as very sentimental things i had not been able to get moved yet  my gpa was the father i didn t have  and he taught me many things    he is also why i got into gaming   he brought me an nes with mario duck hunt and the zapper when i was barely able to hold a controller  took me fishing  arrow head hunting  swimming  etc  the things he left me  i cherish them  on top of that  they stole the money i had saved up and i couldn t prove any of it  i knew it was them  i yielded that because there was nothing to be done and besides my gma and mother  my family has nothing to do with me  i m not like them at all  interest and personality  i was expected to keep paying their bill     are you fucking stupid    so when i said that  they pretty much made it where i can no longer visit my gma  because after a fistfight in her yard with my cousin and uncle  they have told me that they will call the cops on me if i ever set foot there again    so now where i grew up is completely off limits as is my gma  so i m where i am now  but alone  i have asked my mother for help  but she can t really do anything as she s currently going through an issue my stepfathers old job caused with their income  something about him accidentally earning too much that last year before he retired  the woman i love though  she still sees me everyday  take her to work  bring her home  to the store  etc  despite how far i have fallen      she still wants to be around me  and tries to help me when she can    she cooks for me and buys food sometimes  gives me gas money  and spends time with me  i have found a new job but it s only     hours a week at minimum wage     what she does for me     even with everything going on with her mom and sister  lots of stress from there because her mom has had to be watched due to an accident  and her sister dumps her   kids off on them and takes off all the time  i guess i m trying to say that it brings me to tears     i want to help her and make her happy as i know she s struggling with all the stress her job and home life put on her    i honestly thought about cutting ties with her and moving w o saying anything  because i feel like i m a source of stress to her as well  i love her so much  and i had thought about proposing to her  i still do     i never have felt the amount of love and care in my life for anyone  even myself  ever     before her  i thought i d go through life alone  and i was ok with that     until i met her  suddenly   i feel things for someone else    i cared and still do  about my gma and mother  and i ve been in a few relationships in the past  but they were only a few months and it was mostly sex  eating together and just hanging out   when those relationships split and we were just friends   except one who was very bitter over a few things  it did not hang over me  like i was missing something  i didn t feel much really  i enjoyed being with them and around them  but if they weren t there  no loss  her  it s been different   before i asked her to move in  which i never did with anyone else  i started feeling     things for her  i tend to over think things and yes    i m stupid because i try to analyze love  and i have never felt the way she made and still does  make me feel  i love her  i truly do  for the first time in my life  i started thinking about what someone else wanted before i got something i wanted  i did and still do what i can for people i care about  but with her  i really care when i do those things  i think about her before myself  and if i can make her happy  there isn t a cost that is to high  she means everything to me  and as i said before  i thought about leaving for here as well  despite not really being in the best circumstance to do it     i have suffered and dealt with so much this last year  and have even had my phone cut off     yet she still wants me to take her to work  be around her  and treat me to food  and even bought me some clothes for my new job     i just don t want to be a ball and chain to her     i feel like i m hurting her just being here  and i can t stand it     we aren t together  and i don t know if we ever will get back together     but i want her to be happy  safe  successful and comfortable  i pushed her through cosmetology school and she has since gotten a job at a stylist place and she s doing amazing there   and she s happy there with the people she works with  i just feel like i m the last memory of a time maybe better forgotten     she suffers from self image problem  and thinks she s ugly     it breaks my heart to hear her say those things     i wish i could show her how amazing she looks to me  to everyone else     she is the most beautiful smart  hard working  attitude giving woman  person  i have ever met  there is no one else for me out there  no other woman even gets my attention     there has been a few times where i ve been flirted with and straight asked out  but i just couldn t do it  we aren t dating now  but it felt and thinking now  still feels like betrayal     she is the one i love  i have given my heart to  and she knows this    i just don t want her feeling like because i feel that way  she should reciprocate  there is tons of guys out there that could do more for her  give her more  take her places  etc    at this  point  i m a complete failure  and she should avoid me before being dragged down     i love her more than anything  and i want the best for her  even if it s not me     i am sorry for the length of this post  i m just all over the place with emotions     trying to keep it to together while i type this  and i guess  to ask others what they think     what should i do  i do t know anymore     i m struggling   wise and emotionally    i have no one to talk to anymore  i don t put any of this in her simply because she already deals with so much  i couldn t bear to hurt her ,0
t3_dlq3z1,greygolden,i wish there was an apocalypse,i was a happy child growing up   but these days it seems like the path that the world is on is hugely contributing to our society s rising depression and anxiety   am i the only one that feels this way   that the world is basically just one big scam  and more and more people are finding out about it each day  and therefore have no motivation whatsoever to live this life that we all so desperately dream of   because what is the point after all   to die   to live amongst people who have more money than my brain can even fathom but don t consider those who can t afford to feed their families every day     we all sit through the bullshit that s fed to us every day in school  work  over social media  the news  politics  and to me it seems like the younger generations just don t want to deal with it   thats why imo more and more people are getting into hard drugs  committing suicide  and dealing with horrendous depression and anxiety   they have nowhere else to go  they re stuck in an unbreakable cycle of life that they can t keep up with  or don t want to keep up with   honestly sometimes i wish there was a giant plague or an apocalypse just so i don t have to lead the same basic life as everyone else   it seems way more exciting to me to  actually  struggle to survive  at least let me fight some zombies instead of having my card get declined trying to buy     worth of gas at the gas station  than to live the same bullshit life over and over again  and to  every week  struggle to pay for gas to get to school  or to buy groceries for my family   grow up  go to college  find yourself largely in debt  get a job  get married  have kids  struggle to survive like always  maybe watch some loved ones die  go into debt to pay for my child s college education  which is a complete bullshit scam by the way   watch your kids follow the same basic cycle and then die   that s it   that s all we get  after the struggles  sadness  blood sweat and tears  that s what we get   am i the only one that wishes maybe things would change   i m sick of seeing and dealing with the same things every day   and don t even get me started on social media and how many people have their heads so far up their own asses   it makes me sick   am i alone in this situation   is anyone else angry with the world like i am   or feel like why join in on the rat race  bullshit society at all  when it s clearly going downhill and we can t do anything to save it   sorry   i do realize this post had no real basis to it  but i feel like i just needed to rant to see if anyone else felt even remotely the same way as i do   also i mean no offense to anyone if anything came off offensive  this is solely my opinion and i m relatively stupid so just don t listen to me if i pissed you off,0

t3_dlj47z,helpisneeded_,i dont know what s wrong with me,why am depressed  i have all the things that should provide someone with a happy life  i dont mean material things  i have a good job in my dream field  i literally have the job i wanted in my childhood  not only that it pays well i m comfortable i have a roof over my head  i can afford the luxarys i want  i m not rich by any means but i m comfortable  i m close with my family i have friends  i have a girlfriend who i love dearly who loves me  a woman i can see a future with  spend the rest of my life with    i think theres just somthing wrong with my brain with me as a person  i ve been to the doctors  i ve tried the medication  it helps somewhat but i still don t feel great about myself  i used to blame it on the loneliness but i met my girlfriend over a year ago   i m not lonely anymore yet i still occasionally feel like i want to fade away from the world  i used to have problems i could attribute to it but i ve worked on every one of them and yes i m in a better place than i used to be but i still feel like shit a lot of the time     i flicker from having a good time with my girlfriend or friends to wishing i was in bed asleep and having to pretend to continue to enjoy myself i just shut down randomly  i constantly feel like i m not good enough emotionally while logically knowing that i am  i haven t felt real motivation for years  i m waiting for everyone else to notice how much of a peice of shit i am then when my life is worth nothing no one will care what happens to me    i m a fairly selfless person  i like to help others with their problems because i feel valuable and because it distracts me from thinking about my own     my partner knows i struggle with mental health but i dont often share when i m feeling low because as i said before it can be randomly in the middle of having a good time i dont want to constantly kill any happiness we have together by proclaiming i feel like shit  i want her to have a good time that s my priority  she also struggles her self when she feels down she doesn t have the ability to function and put on a mask so i feel like it s up to me to be the strong one     nothing makes me happy  if it does it s extremely fleeting ,0
t3_dlbe8v,highdumbhoe,i m a coward,i m truly a coward  i am to terrified to actually kill myself and that is a fact  i fantasize about being dead  fantasize about jumping off bridges  shooting myself in the head that would never happen i don t have access to guns   fantasize about being dead  i hope it s like having a dreamless sleep  i want it so bad  i m tired of existing  i hate that i am actually a human being  i don t want to do anything with my life and often don t care what happens  i wish i d get hit by a car  but i still stop when i see one coming  i still obey traffic lights  i still look at both sides of the road before i cross  i want to be dead more than anything in the world  but yet i m scared to die  it makes me feel cowardice  makes me feel like i m simply an attention seeker  i like to say to myself  it s not a matter of if i kill myself but of when  and i cannot answer that  ask the thought of taking my own like terrifies me yet pleases me all the same  i hate it  i don t really believe that i have a future worth seeing  as i probably don t i m    and already a drop out basically   when i wake up i feel bad that i ve actually woken up  i don t deserve my life  i don t want it either  i m just a shitty person  i can t make connections with people nor do i really want to and yet i want to also  i feel like i should start cutting again  since i m too scared to actually kill myself that s the next best option  but i feel like i can t  cutting is so easily noticeable  but yet if i do  there s always the chance i ll lose a little too much blood  and i ll be over  which is my goal in life  the only goal i have is to end up dead  i don t care about my future  i don t want it  but if i m too scared to kill myself  then the future will come  and i don t really want it to  i want to eternally   sleep  i want nothing  i want to be nothing  i don t want to exist  i fuck everything up  i can t seem to do anything right  i m tired of trying  i just want everything to end ,0

t3_dl9fbd,queerjudas,what small thing has stopped you from killing yourself ,sometimes the most seemingly insignificant things have stopped me from killing myself and i wanted to hear other people s experiences  for me  i had once had planned to kill myself in the afternoon  but when the time came one of my friends invited me over to play fortnite  despite not even liking the game  i wanted to spend time with him and figured id spend a few hours at his place and then get back to my  plans   but i ended up staying until  am and by the time i had gotten home i was too tired  and the next morning i had  calmed down  or cooled off enough to not be in immediate danger,0
t3_dlcenz,pseudosyk,i m ready ,hey guys  i made a burner to post this   i don t want to be found  it s been a long road coming and lately i ve gotten a lot off my chest   i finally told my family what happened to me as a kid  i came clean about a lot of the things i went through and knew   i was terrified of dying because i was so scared of anyone finding out after i was gone and not being around for the reaction  i m not scared anymore   i feel so free   i feel so ready  i just wanted to say thanks for all the support i ve gotten on here with previous accounts  thanks for always listening   my story is finally coming to a close  it feels so peaceful   i ve got everything set in motion  and i ve started the process  my notes are out   i won t see the sun come up  it was a beautiful sunset to remember    to my dear personal spider man if you ever see this  don t blame yourself  you are everything to me  life will go on and i promise you ll see another good day without me  it s not your fault  not everyone can be saved  my time with you was the best i d ever known   i hope everyone finds their peace  i love you all ,1

t3_dli6el,Put69,is there anything that is important ,i don t know where to start  i think its time to open up to someone  even if i don t know you it literally feels way better sharing anything than with my family or friends  i struggle with depression and social anxiety  i learned by myself if you open up to friends you are just gonna get used  they use your instability for there own goods tell you you can trust them they are always there for you but when there is someone  better  coming beside them they just start talking to you like they wouldn t know you for real and start changing there behaviour in front of you  i just stopped to believe that the bond of family and friends exist  everyone is completely alone   in my opinion and experience i have tried many times to be happy  there has been month of sadness and feeling worthless  suddenly there comes one day where you think everthink will change by that day but the day after everything turns the same again  i don t believe i will find happiness in my life anymore  after trying it a millions of times i think i have the right to put it like that  but i am still hoping that maybe someone can show me how to find a solution for all those big problems and hopeless days i tried finding it ,0
t3_dl7icj,throwawaay1425235241,advice ,i have typed this out more than   times and deleted it  i always end up writing    or so pages  bit too long i think  but this is as small as i can make it without making it dot points  also venting just a little bit      if it s too long just skip to the last   bottom paragraph   bit of backstory      i started getting depression around december last year  and i am pretty positive i know the reasons      a lot of things happend in december and january  my grandfather got brain cancer  right after that my mother started fighting with my dad  and it was bad  lots of yelling  degrading  embarrassing him in front of members of the family  for example  she started screaming  loud enough so around   houses can hear  about how his penis doesn t work properly and listed all the problems  now  i m pretty sure no one  man or woman wants there personal problems to be screamed out so everyone can hear  so that made me extremely mad    every single day i would wake up to screaming       am  i honestly was about to go into emergency housing cause it was making my mental health go wild  and then my girlfriend broke up with me  my fault  i fucked up big time but it still made me pretty depressed  and then we also got evicted from our house    this point in my life was the worst i have ever felt  i grew up to be a man and suck it up  i tried to do that for so long  and of course  i had a phone at the time  so i looked up on social  everywhere i looked it said i needed to talk to someone  so  i did  so every time i was having a mental breakdown i would call one of my best friends  she is also depressed so that kind of gave me some comfort knowing she knows how i feel  didn t really work but i tried anyway      time passes  i never got over my ex  my mental health stopped fluctuating and i kinda just stayed depressed  i couldn t distract myself anymore  at the point in time  i jumped off a building  roof of a   story  i was stupid and thought that it would kill me  a lot of people say they regretted right after they jumped  not me  i survived  i hit one of the overhangs that i was meant to jump over and rolled onto the ground  couple bruises and cuts  not even a broken bone  did have to limp home though      in march  this year  my ex was doing so much better with her anxiety  that i caused   we began to talk and got back together  we were great and i actually wasn t depressed  i didn t really notice till     months after we started dating again   but i was happy  i kinda forgot what it felt to constantly smile  doesn t matter if i was alone  i just smile       my grandfather passed away on fathers day  and a few months later my girlfriend broke up with me again   it honestly was so much more painful splitting this time  cause i really felt like me and my ex were getting along   like last time the first few days were fine  but then i got back into how i use to feel  and i know now that i m not scared to jump  and next time i get the urge to jump i will  and this time it won t be a   story roof  i don t know if it will be today or in a week but i will for sure  i have been self harming  i have never done this    and i don t do those small cuts or cuts at all  i m     and weigh    kg      lbs  and a lot of that is muscle  i don t go to school and only leave my room twice a day  once in the morning to go to the toilet and once at night  get food  i punch with full power every part of my body  i never bruise unless i do it multiball times  so it s perfect so no one finds out  i mainly punch my temple  jaw and chest  i got to the point where i couldn t eat food for a couple of days cause my jaw would be in so much pain  but i did it anyway  and still do    i can fight the urges to do it  but its when i least expect then is when i do it  for example  i would die in a video game  punch my head in and so on      i honestly don t know what s wrong with me  i think i have a mix of sad  mad and being insane    but anything will help  i live in australia and have medicare so everything here is free  but the public psychologists are trash and i would have to pay for a private one with a good psychologists  feel free to ask questions and i will answer them  go to the moon and back i can handle any question  and i doubt someone can say something over the internet that would make me more depressed or want to kill myself   so  don t hold back  i want to be happy again and i only have a certain amount of time before i get the urge to  and who knows maybe i can fight the urge off   ,1

t3_dllt16,zesha,there s too much happening and i just want to die,  edit    it s about      am and i ended up not going through with it tonight  i had a  job trial  with a job coach to see if an overnight stocking job would be a good fit for me  and despite how hectic the day leading up to it had been    i felt decently comfortable at this place and feel better right now  i m still skeptical  i m used to having really good things happen and then everything crash around me  i suppose i ll see how things go  it s not like the bridge within walking distance is going to  go  anywhere  it ll be there when i need it     i don t even know where to start with this post  there s so much in my head right now  i guess i ll start with home  i live with my grandparents and my cousin  who my grandma adopted as a son       years ago  he has fetal alcohol syndrome  because of that he has been allowed to get away with things any normal person would have been jailed for  such as hitting and being needlessly physical with a young child  ages     that i can remember   i can t stand yelling because all it does is remind me of him screaming at me then beating me up  nothing was ever done  i don t know if he stopped at   because that s when the family friend got caught being the pedophile that he is around me or what  but after age   o just remember my cousin becoming more verbally abusive than physical  it wasn t any better  between that and the family friend trying to fondle me  my depression started    i ve been suicidal for a long time  off and on throughout middle and high school  but over the past   years a lot has happened to make me think   man  life just isn t worth it     funny thing is  i have a boyfriend that loves me  his family adores me  can t move in with any of them  sadly  or i would  since i still have to live with my grandparents and cousin i still get to hear the verbal abuse every day and my grandma is such a pushover it s no wonder my cousin almost unredeemable  she doesn t even bat an eye when i remind her that he bullied a girl  not me  to nearly attempt suicide  tried to poison his supervisor by putting hand sanitizer in her drink  and he admitted he was trying to poison her   or that he tried to strangle one of our cats that had gotten sick    and then when i forced him out of the room the cat was in  he went and found a baseball bat  and intended to bash my head in   but no  nah  everything is fine  he s not dangerous  he won t be the cause of me killing myself   you d also think i d be fine since i now have a job coach and a prospective job  i m supposed to do a job trial tonight from   pm to  am  i should be excited  right  i m not  i ve had to take my grandparents and cousin to the doctor today  then i m supposed to go with a friend later to get interview clothes  but i don t really want to  i was supposed to see my therapist today  but i canceled that appointment  i don t feel like i m getting any real help from her  my psychiatrist  or my case manager anymore  it s gotten to the point where there answer for everything is hospitalization  and i refuse to go through that hell again  death is better than the mental wards around here    i m tired of hearing   you ve got all this good stuff happening for you   i know  and if i weren t severely depressed  if i didn t look at every bridge and wonder if it s tall enough to kill me if i jump  if i felt like hanging in there would matter    but i don t   i don t feel like living matters anymore  it feels silly now to have written what i did before when it really just boils down to i  want  to  die   i don t want the interviews  or the job trials  or     hour  nor do i want my shitty    h job where they keep pushing me to do manager duties while not giving me a manager s wage  i want to die   i love my boyfriend  he s great  most of his family is great  if i weren t so depressed  if i could be happy  i can tell we d have a wonderful future  but we won t  because i m depressed  because the major depressive disorder that s stuck in my head is right  it s better to die    i haven t decided when i should do it yet  it s less of a  if  now and more of  whenever i have the energy   i m so tired of basically having no days off  when i m not at work i m going to appointments or taking them to appointments or seeing family members in the hospital for one reason or another  and i m just tired  i m tired and no one will give me a break  and the only way i m going to get a break is if i m dead    that s life   my case manager said once   you just do things because you have to   only she was referring to bowing to every whim my grandma has  because i spend     of my week either driving her somewhere or listening to how she doesn t have any money  but somehow she has money for me to take her to all these places  if that s  life  then life can fuck off and so can my apathetic case manager    i started self harming again  it s becoming the only thing that keeps me from snapping  it s tiding me over until i can jump    sometimes fear shows up  what if i don t die  what if i m permanently cripple  i don t know  i have no access to anything more lethal than jumping  i ve got a tdo on record  so no way will they sell me a gun  i think jumping will work though  i wanted to try and stick it out but i don t think i can anymore  maybe after the job trial tonight  won t be a lot of people on the road at  am  grandma will be asleep and won t even realize until the next morning that i didn t come home  cousin will only care because he won t have anyone to bully anymore    i m tired  but it s about time this pathetic sack of flesh died  i don t want to be alive anymore ,1

t3_dldydl,smilingfemalemachine,one is the loneliest number ,this post is probably going to be all over the place  but so are my thoughts  so please hang in there   my entire life  i ve been constantly abused  friendships  relationships  family  i ve been molested  raped  hit  gaslit  cheated on countless times  financially abused  emotionally abused  psychologically abused  you name it  it s all i know   i m honestly a really modest person  but i know i m loving  caring  empathetic  driven  loyal  honest and i do my absolute best to be a good person in every aspect  i m not perfect  and i don t think  anyone  deserves the abuse i ve been through  but i especially don t understand why it happens to me  i m not confrontational  i m not a controlling bitch  i m pretty easy going  generally speaking   because of my history with abuse  at this point in my life  i m realizing that i don t trust  anyone  anymore  at all  i let people in just fine and consider myself to be an extremely open person  i don t hide things or try to keep people out  i m a truly open book and nothing is off limits  but letting people in just makes me trust them even less  it s like agreeing to babysit kids you know are monsters  yes  i let you into my house  i signed up for this  knowing what i was getting myself into  but now i have to watch every single move you make so i know you re not breaking all my shit since you re here   my parents divorced when i was   and my dad died in an accident at the ripe old age of    when i was     we didn t have the best relationship for much of my life  but just when things were getting better and i felt close to him for the first time  he died  and it fucked me up for years  and now  almost    years later  i m realizing how much my relationship with him fucked me up too   i ve always craved love and affection  i ve never really gotten it from anyone  aside from maybe my mother  i ve been married  gotten divorced  been in relationships  had deep meaningful friendships that dissolved into nothing  nothing lasts forever  i understand that  but i m a true hopeless romantic and i want that  forever  more than i ve ever wanted anything  and i think that s why i ve tolerated so much abuse and neglect  just because they were bad to me sometimes didn t mean they were bad to me  all  the time  and if they  loved  me  then i was just compromising with myself  that s how i looked at it   i m in a relationship now with someone i am absolutely crazy about  he is everything i ve ever wanted and more  we haven t been together long by any means  officially together for only about a month  but i already feel all kinds of ways about him that i ve never felt for anyone  even my ex husband  we spend time together every chance we get  sometimes for days straight  but i don t even trust  him  and it breaks my fucking heart because i want to so badly  i pretend i do  i m not trying to overstep any boundaries and make him think i m some possessive bitch  but i m constantly wondering why it s taking him so long to text me back or what he s doing when he seems preoccupied or why he didn t answer his phone  and it makes me feel so horrible  i don t pry and just act like everything is fine  and he honestly seems none the wiser  it s not like i m completely irrational  there  are  occasional things present that would generate concern from a normal person  but a normal person would give him the benefit of the doubt  i can t   i ve felt like this in every relationship  whether it was justified or not  and as far as friendships go  i m constantly telling myself that they re just my friend because they feel bad for me  or that they have something to gain from me  things like that  i m not close to any family  aside from my mom and my stepdad and one of my siblings  but i don t  really  trust any of them either  they ve all hurt me or lied to me at some point  i don t expect anyone to be perfect  i just want the same unconditional love and loyalty and commitment i have to offer to be returned   no matter who s around  i always feel completely alone  and i m too insecure of a person to be as independent as i ve had to be  and i know i m not the only one that feels this way  but that isn t at all comforting  i ve never felt so down  i don t want to kill myself  and i don t want to die  i just want to sleep and wake up when everything doesn t suck anymore   idk if anyone will actually read this  and idk why i m even posting this  guess i just needed to vent about it to strangers online because i don t have to pretend to trust any of you   anyway  if you  did  read this  thanks  i hope you re having a better day than i am ,0
t3_dkkqy3,FirecrossD,no where else to turn,everyday i have the thoughts  gun  hanging  can i od on tylenol pm  i embrace the idea of a semi plowing through my car during my drive to from work  i live in a fairly big city  what if i walk through the dangerous side of town    since i was around     idealation has been my norm  was always too chicken to actually go through with any of it  and the idea that if someone else did it for me  my hands would be clean of the act itself  now at    and two kids  i m still the same    life has been weighing me down for     years with all the struggles of adulthood  i am too weak to continue and too weak to do anything about it  i tried therapy  but it just felt like it was going no where  and even with insurance it s too expensive  my employer offers counseling but i m suspect  what if it gets back to my boss and coworkers i am a nutcase  i just want to be numb  numb to my pains so that i can continue on  i want to be here for my kids until the end  i don t want them to ever know how weak their father truley is   i don t really know  why  i am posting here  i just need to vent  i have no other ears to turn to  my wife says she gets it  but i don t think she really does  she and the kids barely fuel my drive to live  and for that i am ashamed    maybe i am just too stressed  does that cause depression  between work and home i am running on empty  i don t remember the last time i got   full hours of sleep    anyways  thanks for listening  for now i guess i ll just keep dreaming of an end to all of this  of a time i can finally rest ,1
t3_dlkm7j,SageIon666,struggling for so long,depression and anxiety have been something that have tormented me since i was    or     undoubtedly coming out when my parents divorced  now at    i am still struggling as much as i ever have  i recently just started a new job in a union as an electricians apprentice and i couldn t be happier about that  but depression is really getting in the way  ive missed multiple days of work and i have not gotten in trouble  yet   i have communicated with my supervisor in the program that i am struggling and they understand but i also know there is only so much i can miss to continue to perform and stay in the program  right now i am at a crossroads  i don t want to leave the program but i dont know if i can handle it right at this moment  i have a job pretty much lined up that pays about the same if i do decide to leave  but i would also feel like i am giving in to my mentality  another thing is that i have been taking lexapro   mg    mg when i am doing well  since my diagnosis and i kind of want to talk to my doctor about changing medications  but that is a whole other issue in itself  i really just don t know what to do ,0
t3_dltwe6,Starlightalchemy,coping methods,i can t draw anymore  not because i m bad at it  but because it doesn t work anymore  i used to use it to vent out negative feelings  but with the lack of motivation and stuff like that  its pretty much been useless  recently  though i don t do it often  i ve started cutting my flesh  i can t draw anymore because cutting releases stress a lot better than drawing ever did  it also doesn t help that when i have a panic attack  i cut without thinking  they re never deep  but they helped in a sick sort of way    i regret the first time i ever picked up that knife   how do you break the habit ,0
t3_dllemt,Blackest-Bile,fuck ,i don t know what to title this  sorry   i m sick of this shit  man   i m sick of dealing with being chronically suicidal  i m sick of my emotions being set off so fucking easily  i m sick of myself  my life  and living   i know nothing will improve   i ve been in therapy for years and i have made zero progress   i ve done the whole psychiatry path  as well  and no meds have really done shit   i m a lost cause  and i know that    i ve given up on the idea of improving  and i don t want to deal with this anymore   i worry about hurting my mom  but i know she ll live   i have a slight worry towards my friends  as well  but it s not as much  i know they ll be fine and get over it     maybe i m pathetic  but  at this point  i don t really care   nobody i ve met understands what this shit s like  and i know i can t talk to anybody in my life fully about shit because i know i can t trust any of them fully   so  yeah   i dunno ,1

t3_dkmjsb,lsahng,     please tell me it gets better after high school  i have a rope sitting in my amazon cart ,i ve suffered from this long enough to know that suicidal thoughts are fleeting   yet  they keep coming back  too often  i tell myself that i ve grown stronger since then  but the events in my life seem to be worsening  in the past   days  i got rejected from a full ride scholarship that would allow me to pursue my educational dreams  i poured my heart and soul into that application  only to find out that even beyond my stats  my story and years of hard work just weren t good enough  i also found out that my ex cheated on me for an entire year  they re all laughing at me on social media now  my grades are declining  straight a student for    years   now a chronic c student   i find myself  once again  curled up in the corner of my room drenching my t shirt in tears and snot   my mind is currently consumed with the thoughts of   what did i do wrong  what am i worth  am i too ugly  just like i had always thought  why did i not connect the yeast infections and utis to my partner s disloyalty  can i trust anyone anymore  how will i go into my next relationship without insecurities    i ve reached out to so many caring friends  but i know i m burdening them with my issues  seeking professional help is not an option at the moment  as my parents believe that mental health issues do not exist  they are genocide survivors  and they d tell me   how can you be so frail while living a cushioned life   i feel guilty  disappointed  numb  confused  selfish   but most of all  i am tired  i need a long  long rest  i recently read a post somewhere about how sleep is just a free trial of death  sounds good to me   i pride myself on developing my own coping mechanisms  but are they really working if i continue to revisit that corner in my room ,1
t3_dl76mh,DIBE25,she save me and i told her,      i got my shit together and i told her         i was suicidal and i had to tell her  so i did    i told her how i felt through the last weeks and how she d been absent  she was sorry  as she doesn t want to lose me   she told me how important i was for her  that touched my heart  something that didn t ever happen before  she was worried and i felt bad  because i felt like she was wasting herself over me   i begged her to be happy  as she always is  she always is happy  she s the most optimistic person i know  she understands me really well    she might be the only person i know of to really understand me  i m crying right now  as i m writing    she s special  she really does understand me  she goes deep into my subconscious  she knows more than i do about myself   i feel better  i hope you have a great evening or whenever you re reading this  thanks,1
t3_dl67gp,anonymous876543,how can i not give up  after these last few years ,these last few years have been so bad that i actually laugh to myself whenever something bad happens now  i got a letter today and thought to myself   this can t be good   and low and behold it wasn t  i actually laughed to myself like a weirdo after opening it  i just don t understand how anyone can tell me to keep going  or be patient  its infuriating  i know of course that people have it worse  then i feel even worse about myself for being so depressed  this is some of the stuff i ve had to deal with in the last few years  i ll keep things as short as possible   possibly abused  basically my partner has suffered with depression  social anxiety  ptsd  past physical abuse  suicide attempts and self harming  we met at uni and i isolated myself from friends and family to keep her happy  and threw myself into my degree in a stupid attempt to make it worthwhile  she made me feel guilty for having friends  guilt tripped me into doing countless things i didn t want to do  looked at my phone without permission  interrogated me about girls i knew  and much more i wont bother listing  i never really thought about it as being abusive until i recently had some therapy and my therapist said it sounded like emotional abuse  we finally break up  but a week later  whilst still living together  a family member of her s commits suicide  she leans on me like we are still together  and tells me things like  i know i m not suppose to say this  but i still love you   whilst i m down with her and her family for support  this week she admitted to feeling suicidal and having strong urges to self harm  whilst making me promise not to tell anyone else  she also told me she self harmed when i went away for a few weeks for a family holiday  i told her she might feel better phoning samaritans or something and she told me she didn t need to because she was talking to me  she is due to restart some therapy  but refuses to go home and get it back down near her family  because she doesn t want to change therapist  they have offered her therapy here straight away with a different therapist but she wont take it either  i go from thinking it was abuse to thinking i m a piece of shit for thinking it was  it s real confusing   job career is a embarrassing  as mentioned before i used my possible abuse as a means to motivate myself to do well at uni  i remember thinking to myself  all this misery will at least be worth it  in some way  oh how naive and stupid  i did well  and was able to get a full time graduate job before i even graduated  the pay was pretty crap for a role wanting a graduate            and it was really boring  but i was happy to just have a grad job tbh  fast forward     months and i have nothing to do at work  i worked through the organisations backlog of clients enquires and they struggled to give me stuff to do  at the beginning i would ask for extra tasks  but i would just be told to make massive spreadsheets with useless data that would never be touched again or followed up with  so i did my expected tasks which took at most an hour a day and applied for other jobs while at work  after working there for a year  they tell me that they will have to put me down to three days a week due to a lack of funding  it s a charity so it sounds plausible and sadly expected  however when they just recently brought a new piece of film equipment for hundreds of thousands of pounds  and i helped bring in new clients for more than my yearly salary  it felt like a slap in the face  i get nowhere after hundreds of job applications  even after seeking professional help with my cv  i was told by the university career service i should be getting interviews for the jobs i m applying for with my cv  they said they had nothing to recommend i do  frustrated i stupidly decided to do a masters thinking it would help me stand out more  but after two months i realise it is not for me  i m jaded as fuck about the value of a degree and the quality of the course seemed suspect to me  i decided to quit straight away so i wouldn t have to pay any money  and phone my parents to let them know  big mistake  we argue and when my mum asks what i m going to do if i quit  i tell her  get a job obviously   the silence after was deafening  i argue back for maybe the first time in my life and end up hanging up the phone  fast forward maybe    hours and my dad is in hospital due to his heart  i blame myself and i kind of shut down for   months  i dont quit uni  but i dont attend or do assignments and i struggle to get out of bed  looking back i think this was what finally broke me  years of feeling like want i want will hurt people because of my partner  and now there was my dad on a hospital bed  because i tried to put myself first  as solid evidence  after seven months of this i pick myself up somewhat  and manage to get a shitty job in retail i could have done whilst at school  i did get an interview for a job in london  but guess what  it just so happened to coincide with a family holiday in australia we had been talking about for decades  i said i was happy to do the interview over skype even if it was   am in aussie  but they said no  the best part in all of this was when i asked for some feedback on why i got through to the interview stage  their response read   you met the criteria for the job posting and was therefore offered an interview  wow  so helpful   possible childhood trauma  my therapist also made me reconsider my childhood  my mum has bipolar and i never really thought about how it affected me until now  it s probably why i was too forgiving with my partner   its not her fault it s her mental health   my upbringing might also explain why i struggle putting myself first  and believe i m not worth anything  growing up i felt like everyone else was more important than me  my mum obviously had her manic ups and downs  and was admitted to physic wards multiple times  my dad on the other hand had a stressful job and has always been overweight and even from a young age i worried about his health  my sister on the other hand would actually fight to have herself heard and argue back  unfortunately i just saw this as adding more stress to my mum and dad  as a result  i would just sit there and agree to do whatever in order to keep the peace  as everyone else argued  there s also other little things that other people have said was bad  i broke my arm whilst at school and my mum didn t take me to hospital until three days later  then there was the time i cut my leg with glass  and my mum again didn t take me to the hospital  my dad noticed the cut a few weeks later and took me to the hospital  but it was too late to get stitches  to be fair i got a badass scar out of it   i never thought about how seeing my mum in multiple manic states affected me  but it s hard to ignore the fact it probably did  for example seeing her pace up and down muttering to herself probably didn t do my young mind any good  might also explain why i ve always leaned towards the anxious side of the spectrum   smaller stuff     my very first car broke after   weeks of purchase  dealer refused to repair or refund purchase  took them to small claims court and spend an extra      which would be refunded if they were forced to pay  court rules in my favor  they still don t pay and when the bailiffs go round to collect  they are in liquidation  i get none of my money back and the small legal fees i paid aren t refundable and were for nothing   further evidence that hard work and life is bullshit      my best friend of over    yrs stabs me in the back  i open up to my friends about my depression and possible abuse by my partner on my birthday  christmas eve   he decides to tell his fiance  who then tells my partner  cue further guilt and feeling of being a piece of shit  i called him up on it and he says what i said wasnt very nice  so i end up apologising to him and his fiance  like the doormat i am  then when i talked to him about it again recently he was way more understanding and said he saw it now  i told him i forgave him  but honestly i haven t and i m not sure i will or even should   how the fuck am i not expected to give up  most of this stuff is just in the last   years ,0

t3_dkqbfl,potassium182,i tried to kill myself,i failed  obviously  which is just what i needed  another failure  i tried really hard  like i do at everything but the reality is  i can t do one thing right   for once  i just wanted to do something for me  and what i wanted to do was die  so i made some trial cuts on my leg which were a failure  but i thought that maybe a wrist would be easier and it turns out it wasn t  so i tried to overdose on something but i couldn t find anything  so then i just thought i might as well give up because knowing me  i m too much of a failure to succeed anyway   the worst thing about it  well  the second worst thing  failing was definitely worse  was that i wanted to tell my best friend what i d just done  i don t know why  i love her but i she ll never understand  maybe i did it to make her understand  i don t know  but anyway  i took a picture of my kind of slit wrist  wrote a whole paragraph about how much i want to die and sent it  but not to my best friend  a group chat  a freaking group chat  not only that  i sent it to a group chat full of people from maths camp  yes i am a nerd  than i barely know  i deleted it straight away but not fast enough and i got a message really great guy who s been really helpful but talking to him just makes me feel guilty  i m scared that i m just this big nuisance to him and also i feel terrible that i prefer talking to him over my family or friends that i ve know for ages  and that just makes me wanna kill myself again and again and there isn t a moment in a day or when i m unable to sleep at night  which is pretty much always  that i don t want to die   i just want to die  why do i have to be such a useless failure  why can t i just die    if you got to the end of this really long badly written speech  then i just want to say thank you and sorry for wasting your time ,1

t3_dlkzm0,Broteloo,girl threatens to kill herself  because of me ,so i m going to try to keep this as short as i can but i bet that this is going to be a large post as i think a lot of these  small  details are important for the full story   about four months ago i met two new people in my friend group  let s call them girl a and girl b  girl a had just become the girlfriend of a good friend of mine  when i met girl a  the same time i started getting a crush on girl b  these girls were best friends  as i ve been told since a few months weeks   anyway  after two and a half weeks girl a got dumped and got single again  this was around the same time that i asked out girl b and she said yes  so one night i got into a text conversation with girl a and we just started talking about her breakup and my soon to be date  a friendship grew   eventually  i and girl b stopped dating and continued as friends  i would vent about my feelings about this to friend a and we became really good friends over the summer break  this was because i was on vacation and wasn t with friends so i wanted to text a lot with my friends back home and she because she didn t really have a lot to do  in the course of two weeks  we had sent over        texts to each other  talking about literally anything and everything   but as i got back from vacation  i was surrounded by most of my friends again and i didn t feel the need to text every day and so much with girl a  she didn t like this as it turned out she had developed a crush on me too   but at the same time  girl b wanted to date with me again and i said yes  this is where the drama started  i hadn t told girl a about this because i didn t want to tell a lot of people  but a few days after the conversation with girl b about starting to date again  i was gonna sleep over at girl a s house  there i eventually made the terrible and huge mistake to start kissing and we spent the night making out   this was all my fault and i d taken all responsibility for it and thus i told girl b about it and explained the situation to girl a  what followed would be drama that would take months   since both girls liked me  they became less good friends and eventually became two people who hang around in the same group of friends  girl b had given me another chance for which i would ever be grateful but i took the decision to halt talking to girl a because i didn t trust myself  in this time i told the girl that i didn t want to talk to her  she spent nights writings letters of stuff that she wanted to say to me and tell me  big things about her feelings and just things about her day   but we started growing out of each other  she had always projected herself as a sad  maybe even a depressed person but i started getting annoyed by it because she really victimized herself while taking no action at all to better her life  even though we all talked to her about this and gave advice   we eventually got better friends again but i told her that i didn t want to talk about feelings and such as it would annoy me and make things bad  but she kept victimizing herself  didn t stop and yes i exploded  we got into fights and i said some horrible things  we tried afterwards to keep being friends but eventually  i came to the conclusion that it would be better if we didn t  i told her this many times but she just couldn t deal with it  she just kept hanging on the friendship that we had during the summer break  she would constantly swing from mood and act impulsively  she would delete and later on add me on snapchat and stuff like that  at the one moment  she said she didn t want to see me and five minutes later she wanted to stay friends  i had to deal with this for weeks and eventually it really just got too much   we tried everything to stop the drama but talking about it wouldn t work and i told her to just let it go and stop texting me  but she wouldn t stop  over the weekend she has sent me over sixty texts  of which     being long paragraphs   because talking about it had never worked in the past and only resulted in more problems  i decided to ignore the messages   i opened the messages but wouldn t read most of them  in some of those texts so told me she hoped i would die and wished horrible things upon me and a few minutes later she told me that i was a great person  she sent links of sites that said ignoring someone is mentally torturing someone   eventually today she sent me some texts again  this was the third day of ignoring her   she said that she had almost killed herself the day before because of how things are between us  she claimed that she tried to kill herself before  she also claimed to be depressed but my friends and i know her  we know her problems and are convinced she isn t depressed  her psychiatrist says she isn t depressed  but if she truly were depressed and tried to kill herself  she would be the third in our group who would ve tried to kill themselves  one of those already succeeded   girl b has also been annoyed by the actions of girl a and has stopped being friends with her  we broke up again as we both agree we are better off as friends but we do have a strong friendship and both feel like girl a needs do change   now my problem is that i don t know what to do  i have tried talking to her before but nothing came out of it  i have tried ignoring her but now she claims to be suicidal  i feel like she s manipulative and victimizes herself a lot because she is addicted to getting attention  i don t want someone s coffin on my conscience but i don t want to keep going on with this drama  i suggested talking to her parents but my friends are convinced that won t help  all i know is that i don t need this on my conscience   she has been emotionally draining to me and found ways to piss me off as no one has before  i don t believe she is mentally crazy but i am convinced that her thought process isn t right   i m not asking to be judged by previous actions taken by me or to be asked what s wrong with me  i just need help with this dramatically difficult situation ,1
t3_dkz0l6,mdmabish,what triggers your suicide thoughts and what do you think at that moment ,whit me the first thing is that i start to panic about those thoughts  sometimes everything triggrs me and then it ends up with harming myself and deep brething and crying some times i actually try to overdose with pills,1
t3_dltpg9,NicSSB,is it more spiteful to kill yourself when someone says to  or be an asshole to them instead ,see  my mom just accused my last suicide attempt being fake and told me to quote  swallow the whole bottle   so would it cause her more pain if i did  or if i stayed in her life and fucked it up the best way possible ,1

t3_dkcu46,Notgreendayanymore,right  so this is me ,so i m    now  i have had   physical things happen to me     years old and i slipped on a wet stairs in a club and lost a tooth     and i slipped in an apartment lobby and lost a second front tooth  hospital the second time and i cried so much until i started talking to the woman next to me who had a very real problem  i won t say what it was as she was the nicest person ever  she put my tears ahead of why she was there  she is an angel  so skip forward  and i hope she is ok  but all my heart hopes she is great   so that s me  never able to do anything normal because i lost a few of my teeth and then because of that let go because i was on the verge or actively trying for a long time and now at     it s too late to be normal again because of what happened in the last few years   this should be a throwaway ,1
t3_dloupi,CptJoestar,something has always felt  off   idk i just need somewhere to put these thoughts ,i ve always been afraid of opening up to people so i hope this helps  i remember when i was younger about elementary age i remember feeling that happiness was always harder for me then the other kids  later on in life at about highschool i always had some sort of numbness emotion wise and i realized that i had started to drift away from people in general  i never really questioned this until now  i m a freshman in college now and i think i ve hit a breaking point  i m immensely unsatisfied with the state my life is in but i would never think about it to hard or talk to people about it  all through high school to now i  just lied to everyone and kept smiling and cracking jokes  a couple of weeks ago i woke up in a horrible mood buried under the stress of school and the inadequacies of my life  i had always thought suicide was stupid and if you commit it that you were selfish  i thought i would never amount to doing such a thing  but for that entire day ending my life was all i could think about  i had a hard time thinking and breathing all day i might as well not have gone to class that day and when i got off of the train to head home i looked at the train tracks and i remember saying in my head  this could be it   i quickly snapped out of it and walked home  i haven t told anyone about these thoughts and i still have them occasionally and it all culminated to today where i found myself crying into school notes debating on whether to end it or not  i wish i wasn t born  i would kill myself but i would hate knowing the effect it would have on those who care about me  so tonight i m gonna tell my mom how i truly feel inside and seek help before this gets bad     it might a little in cohesive but i just need to get my thoughts out ,0

t3_dlmsy7,SadCrybaby_,i ve been watching videos about suicide,live suicides  the effects it has on family of the victim  stories from survivors etc   i m doing this so i am completely emotionally numb when i ll do it  that way i won t have second thoughts  i can literally feel how i m getting closer and closer to the day i ll put the barell in my mouth and pull the fucking trigger   i m genuinely not scared  i m looking forward to it ,1
t3_dl8qyf,UsuallyAlone,i keep getting trapped between depression  social anxiety and existential anxiety   ,   but i don t think i ve given up hope completely   i feel like a total asshole for being depressed a lot  my life is wasted on me  i have a whole bunch of minor health issues that i obsess about  but nothing debilitating  i m not very happy with my looks but i m told i m handsome  and i m quite tall  which means that in return for back knee pain i get taken more seriously  i have really bad adhd but i m good enough at my job to make a decent living  and i live in a country that is currently doing quite well   someone could probably take all that and be a happy  successful person with a meaningful life  somehow that s not me  i spend my nights and weekends at home playing videogames while watching tv  i m introverted and socially awkward  so i find it difficult to meet new people   usually i don t even know where to begin  i ve stopped doing online dating because it either makes my depression worse  or i get on an emotional rollercoaster that quickly derails and then i take a bunch of innocent women with me down the abyss  it s like treating a migraine with heroin   for years i was avoiding exercise because i thought it was making me sick   now that my depression is getting worse again and i m old enough for a mid life crisis  there has been an interesting development though  some of my anxieties are getting overpowered by a sense of desperation  if i get sick from exercise  then what  i m currently getting sick because of lack of exercise  and some socially awkward situations might actually distract me from being depressed  plus  the times in my life when i ve been stressed also happened to be the ones when i felt most alive   i ve always thought that before my depression becomes terminal  i ll first try all the things i ve been too scared to try  after all  what do i have to lose  i realize that this only works during the  desperate  phases of a depression  and not necessarily during the  unmotivated  ones  so i better make any tiny bit of motivation count   the thing that has worked kinda well recently  hiking  it started out with me getting drunk  which i rarely do  and going out into the woods at night  in total darkness  after a couple of times i decided to go hiking  i even brought some alcohol in case i got too miserable  but i didn t even need it  then i ve done it two more times  and there s really something about being out in nature that i ve underestimated ,0

t3_dkvq1u,frightened_octopus,i m so uncertain about what to say for my suicide note,i want to tell my biological family how much i hate them and shove the most hurtful things they ve said to me back in their face   i don t know if i should tell my grandparents everything i feel so someone else knows just how bad my immediate biological family has made me feel throughout my life  or if they would just take my family s side   i want to make a will and state i want to be cremated and that my family can t have my ashes but i m not sure if a note in the car next to my dead body is legally strong enough to enforce that   i don t know if i should leave my possessions to a charity or support group i believe in so they can be sold to help fund themselves  or if such groups would even care   i don t know if leaving my possessions to the government is the best way to prevent my family from financially salvaging anything from my death   i don t know if i should call     or some hotline just before i die and state that i ve felt emotionally abused by my mother father and especially brother  and that i should read my will aloud just so there s a legal record of it  but i don t know if a hotline would just dismiss what i ve said because i have asperger s and a history of depression so my feelings would automatically not be valid   sometimes i think i just won t leave a note and let it be a mystery to my family  but then i remember all the shit they did to me and that if i didn t tell them how much i hate them then they d win cause i d die the way i lived  silent   i just feel so trapped that no matter what i say or do i ll always be viewed as a crazy person so my thoughts and feelings automatically don t count and my brother will go on being his abusive asshole self and everyone will just agree with him that i m this fucking psycho ,1

t3_dkj93f,Captn_0bv1ous,been thinking about some one that i shouldn t,my friend that i had been friends with since i was in primary school died almost   years ago  i would have turned      months ago and i miss him more and more everyday  it s not sad any longer because i know he s not in pain anymore  he died of stage   spinal cancer and i watched him slip further and further into a spiral of pain as he slowly died far too young  i wish i could give him some of my years that i have left  he deserves to be alive  he was never cruel and never cowardly  he cared for every single person that walks the planets surface and he loved and loved and loved without asking for anything in return   i made a promise to him  the last time i saw him properly  he told me that he doesn t want to see me for a very long time and i promised him that it would be many years before we meet again  it sounds cruel and mean and morbid for people that weren t us  what we meant was that he s going to die  in the afterlife  if there is one  then he wants to have to wait  he wanted me to live the life he missed out on   my friends said that he would be proud of me  but of course he is  he was proud of me for even getting out of bed some days  i just don t want to break a promise  i have never broken a promise before and i think the day i break my oldest  strongest promise is the day i die  ironic yet truthful   he was the love of my life  not sexually or romantically  he was the guy for me  he was my best friend i would spend every minuet without him waiting for him  he made me happy even when my sister went into hospital for brain surgery  even when my mum lost her sight  even when my older brother got hit by a car  even when my younger brother got diagnosed with autism  even when i was off my tits on what ever new drug i found to take the pain away   he was the only thing that stopped the pain  he saved my life  multiple times  he still saves my life even though he s not actually here  i once did mushrooms and i only needed to do it the once because the face i saw in front of me was his  it made me happy and i cried  then bad things started to cloud my vision and i never did mushrooms again  it was terrible  he concurred a price to my life  he made it worth something but he s gone now and i do not know what to do with this currency  i m alive now  because he s not  i just miss him so much  but i m grateful for the days we had  when i get upset i hear his croaky prepubescent voice tell me that everything is going to be ok   it gets harder and harder to remember his face and his voice and it s like i m losing him again  i would give anything for him to tell me i m an idiot and i need to grow up again ,1

t3_dl39oi,ClockworkEyelash,venting   feel free to ignore,if i post on twitter it just makes my friends sad or not take my pain seriously  so thanks for the outlet   i m just on my ten minute break at work  my brain spiraling because i m training and every day i get told new answers to the same questions and i m so fucking stressed and don t even want to be spending my life working at a pointless  soul crushing job being nice to fucking assholes because some idiot capitalist decided to make the world worse by telling customers they re always right   i just want to be dead   i don t know want to hear more news about the evils of humanity  or think about all these kids babies i see dying in climate change  or drive in traffic alongside idiots who would never think suicide is okay but don t mind endangering countless lives while being on their phone  or cause any more pollution with my existence  or have to deal with the fact that my mom abused us growing up and my aunts knew and did nothing  or hear one more guy be a fucking creep because it makes them feel powerful   i could go on forever  but the moral is that i ve wished i was dead every minute of every day for over four years  and the fact that it won t end until i do is the worst part  thanks for letting me vent  i ll be back   fuckkkkkkkkkk ,1

t3_dltm2n,traush,my mom doesn t believe i m depressed gg,my mom sent me to therapy bc my thyroid noticed a  change  so basically she was forced  my mom went with me to the first two sessions  after that she doesn t even bother asking where i am  i got diagnosed with moderate severe depression  situational   i pulled back on telling my mom bc i was embarrassed  and today as is her usual routine of screaming at me i told her my therapist wants me to take antidepressants and she told me i don t need them  and to not dare and tell her yes   i m    and feel lost and have no one to talk to bc i ve isolated myself and my siblings don t talk to me,0
t3_dl9d1l,baylee1096,i feel like i ve made my life hell and i m forced to stay in it ,there s no way to escape   i m stuck with no escape   just temporary fixes that in the end i just feel worse than before   why must i feel this way  i have many good reasons to stay but i still feel this way   was told recently it will never get better   maybe they thought it was the right words  but to me   it somewhat justifies the horrible thoughts that wander my brain  i wish i could wake up tomorrow and just be happy ,0

t3_dldlpp,louisamargo,i feel miserable because of school  what should i do ,to be honest  i ve never really been one to love school or be the most motivated  but i ve always had quite good grades nonetheless  about two years ago  i started feeling pretty horrible and depressed for no real reason  but i still went to school and last year i had the best grades yet  this year though    th grade  i hate going to school more than ever  i used to have tons of friends but during the time i got so severely depressed  i became close friends with some people i actually didn t like at all  just so i wasn t alone  this year  i was very motivated to  do me  and pushed those friends away  which made me feel very guilty and i think hurt them a lot  too  i changed a lot  i felt lost and didn t know where i belonged to  and to be honest that s still the way it is  i ve never felt this alone  most days i can t even fall asleep and before going to school i start crying and having panic attacks  i can t concentrate when i m in school because i just keep thinking about all the things i ve fucked up and how unhappy i am  i have tried everything  every bit of advice i got  i m in therapy  i do a lot of stuff outside of school  i talk to my mum about it a lot and she absolutely understands and supports me  i considered changing schools but found out it isn t possible for my school to change in the middle of the school year  nothing seems to make this feeling of numbness and darkness and hopelessness and most of all  this feeling that i m trapped in this excruciating routine  go away  every morning when i drive to school by bike  i wish for a car to hit me  this morning i woke up knowing that i would have to spend   hours in school and i just couldn t do it  i asked my mom to have me stay at home and now i m laying here not knowing what to do  feeling like i ve screwed up once again  now i m even more behind on school work  and other than that i can t skip school just because  and if i start doing that  it s not going to stop  there s just this big hole of darkness inside my heart and i feel like i m underwater and everything is very far away  very detached from myself  the days are just going by as i drag myself from room to room  from one torture to another  at the end of the day  i feel so tired that i can t do anything other than watch some stupid tv before falling into bed  also  for two years  ever since my unhappiness started  i ve been consistently picking at my pimples every day  it used to be so bad that i would spend hours in the bathroom  until i would bleed and the throbbing pain would be too much  my skin now is nearly perfect but i still find ways to poke at it  and on days where school was especially bad  i will do it for hours  i know this was a lot to read  but i think i really just needed to get this out  there s a lot more i could add but this is probably what s bugging me the most right now  i don t know what to do anymore  i know i should just get through this because it s only one year before our classes get mixed together  but the year s only started and i literally can t take it anymore  the thought of having to get through this agony every day for a whole year makes me feel so hopeless i want to drop out altogether ,0
t3_dlebeg,Redrock26,so close to tying a noose,i ve had depression for as long as i can remember  i got dumped recently and since i don t have a so to leave behind perhaps it s time to tie myself a noose and commit   i ve been unhappy with my life for years and my mental and physical heath isn t getting better  i m    lbs    lbs underweight  and look like a skeleton  perhaps it s time i go and perish on my own terms ,1

t3_dkiq9z,downedthrowaway,one hell to the next  it ll never stop ,i have felt sincerely happy maybe   times in the last few years  maybe more  i can get small spurs of happiness  and get lost in the moment  but all of the bad thoughts come rushing back as soon as the source is gone  ever since i was about    i haven t had a single period of time  where i could just feel happy  and not have to worry or fight  most of my life i ve just been a chesspiece in my parents divorce  i almost snapped in fifth grade  but i swore to improve myself  in every way i could think of  i became pretty much emotionally independant from my parents  i probably wouldn t be able to say i loved them  it hurts so much to look at a happy  loving family  i almost break down and cry  to know that s something i will never have is soul crushing   im    now  every single time i overcome something  a new  even bigger thing comes up  and everytime the feeling that i m just wasting my time  and nothing will ever be better gets stronger    one of the worst things is  that most people assume i have a fantastic life  no one imagines i could have any kind of troubles  so the very  very few times i have ever opened up to anyone  they just looked overwhelned   i just felt like a complete outsider  that look in their eyes killed me  they said they would be there  but only one ever followed up  i go through periods of hope  small periods of hope and much longer periods of despair  the hope makes it so much worse  the tiny feeling that i actually have a chance  everytime i ve been pushed to the edge  some kind of miracle by pure luck has happened  and i managed to just cling on  but when i tried to pursue that miracle  everything always comes crashing down    everytime everything goes wrong  i get a little closer to being pushed over the edge  i already have a surefire method of suicide planned  and whenever im down  i get more of the preparation done  i haven t had a mental breakdown for two weeks now  that s the longest in over half a year  but i feel them coming back  i feel them  and im confident  that i won t be able to escape from them this time  that this will finally be the time  that i break completely and will finallly be able to finish this life of fucking despair   i guess that s why i wrote this  i don t really have anything more to lose  so i guess i hoped for some kind of relief  i don t really think anyone will bother to read this way too long post  but thank you if you did ,1
t3_dld71z,konvu,even my video game  friends  of   years left me,i have been suicidal depressed for close to    years  some days are bad  some are just so bad  but i found a mean of escapism  final fantasy     an mmorpg  there i met this group of people to raid with    people    until today  we have known each other for   years  ups and downs  they helped me get through my worst days by just being by my side  tho on those days i didn t show my depression  i got through those days  thanks to them  and got accepted to a very good master s program in canada  i m from vietnam btw   life changes a lot for me  i m all by myself  school is way to tough and i sank into depression again  this time it shows  i sigh a lot  i sound dead on microphone  i make mean comments  all my faults    after   very good years  they kicked me out of the group     i dunno  i guess internet friend is not really a thing after all    thanks for coming to my ted talk ,0
t3_dljfq6,Elite250,because of a series of unfortunate events  i seem to randomly lose my motivation drive,not sure if this is the right sub for this  i live most of my life pretty much normally without much mental distress until about   years ago  graduated top     in my university  i was extremely confident and was ready to start working and start my life as an adult  however  the reality was not as good as it seems  took me   months before i got my first job  which was through a friend  and it was a low pay job unrelated to my major with unclear prospects  i decided to use this as a stepping stone to get my foot in the door for future job hunts  fast forward   months later  i was bullied and gas lighted by my boss and had extremely toxic and backstabbing co workers  i had to leave the company  as i foresaw myself getting fired  as well as to save my mental health  had to see a therapist a couple of times to convince myself that the entire thing wasn t my fault  result of being gaslighted   losing my job also caused me to lose my residency in that country  i was a foreign worker   after trying to look for a new job for another   months with no luck  i decided to study again in another country   with this fresh start  i started to slowly regain my confidence and aced my classes  however    months into studying  my long term girlfriend of   years left me with no warning through text  it was a long distance relationship   this obviously caused a drastic drop in my confidence and motivation and i started flunking my classes  i also started to binge drink  practically intoxicated     of the time  the other    is the morning right before i drink my first drink  however luckily  through support from my newfound friends as well as family  i managed to pull through and was finally sober after   months  i am now with someone new  almost    months now  and is happy most of the time  however  i have this random spikes of negativity  which i didn t really have before having my first job  when i m in this negative  i am irrationally conscious of what people think say and is always in this weird fight or flight mode that i think everyone is the enemy  i also have occasional thoughts that people can just leave me anytime they want and no matter what i do now  there is nothing i can do to stop it from happening  probably because of the breakup   when i m in this mood  i also lose interest in doing things i usually like such as playing music and video games  it has caused minor inconveniences in my relationship  mainly my partner has to re assure me about certain things   and sometimes it makes me a little bit insecure and makes it hard for me trust my partner  or anyone in general  only when i m in this  mood    as i am graduating again  soon and i have to yet again enter the adult world  thinking about getting a job gives me bad memories and triggers this mood more often  i am not sure if anyone can relate to this   if you do  what are some things mindsets i can apply to alleviate these moods  also  is this common for anyone who were previously depressed  is this something that everyone goes through at some point in their lives ,0
t3_dkgfg8,wowthatsclever,vicious cycles  bro ,i sometimes have this thought when i m especially suicidal     i could take them all out     i could make them all feel it    i could leave in a moment of splendor  however horrific it may be     something along those lines    i once saw a line in a fan fiction  about the impact the death of a main character could have  it talked about how this character  let s call him x  could go out with such brilliance that surely the whole world would feel his loss  not literally  obviously  but the magnitude of his destruction would shake the very foundation of all who knew him   and sometimes  i understand that potential of destruction   and the power it grants  that feeling of knowing that there are a few who love you  amp  may be devastated  but forget them because here you are alone right now  amp  you could just   bring it all to ruins    and they couldn t do a single thing about it    because it s your choice    your choice    one move and i could take an emotional missile to their lives  i could pull the rug from beneath their feet  just like the world has so many times    i could do it    and then  promptly on the heels of that thought of a contained  but effective explosion to my inner circle  comes the remembrance of one s own insignificance  that realization of  oh yeah  i might break them  but they could rebuild    they would keep living  and whatever i d done to spite the universe would only truly ruin me   it wouldn t really matter if i died   just like it doesn t really matter that i live  and then i find myself still wishing for death  except now i m extra sad   it s a vicious mf cycle  bro  anybody feel me ,1

t3_dlbhmu,m_m_3,just gotta vent a little,so today i tried telling my friend who had depression about how i ve been feeling depressed for a while now  it s been a little over a year  i didn t really want to tell her because i didn t want to burden her and make her feel like it s her fault  idk  but she s the first person i tried opening up to because i thought that maybe she could help  i texted her and told her about how i feel empty and nothing matters anymore and i asked for some advice or help and she just left me on open   i feel like she doesn t care or she just doesn t want to deal with me and idk if i m being over dramatic i probably am and i m probably just overthinking it but now i m really regretting this  do you think i shouldn t have done this  i feel like now she has this burden over her shoulders or something idk,0

t3_dkg4jk,GrouchyMistake,the story of this year,i m a   y o male and i ve been struggling with depression and anxiety since before i can even remember  i was put into the foster care system in australia when i was   and stayed there till i was     thankfully i didn t cycle a lot like most kids and i found a foster family who i now call my real family    i m having a really difficult time at the moment  this year had been really really tough  i m in my  th year of uni and i ve failed the last   years because of my mental state  i ve been seeing counsellors and doctors and i m on medication    weeks ago i got diagnosed with bipolar ii and now been medicated for that  but i just need to vent so i m going to talk about my year and how s it s been the worst and best year i ve had in a very long time    so the best year started on the   st of december       i was at college by myself over christmas and in news years eve i wanted to spend it with someone because i couldn t with my foster family  i invited   friends that were in my town at the time who came over  we sat and chatted for an hour and they started to get bored  my mate asked if he could invite a friend over to join us  i agreed  this friend ended up bringing a fair few people  i would say around     me being anxious as all shit over everything in life  freaked out and stayed silent  i ended up having a few drinks and with each one became more confident and less anxious  turns out these people were pretty amazing  i made a friend who was  ft tall and he was honestly the big friendly giant  i made another friend who i ll call max  we hit it off straight away and i ve never connected so well with someone  we instantly became best friends  he stayed over my place for an entire month until we decided to move out with   of our other friends  one of those who was homeless and was desperately trying to find someone to live    a little back story before we get rocky  i lived at a university where at the time our  flat     bedroom house sorta thing  was located on campus  all   people were and still are my closest friends  they are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me  they are very honest people and they told me before moving that i shouldn t  that it wouldn t work out and that the people i m moving in with aren t who i think they are and it won t work out  me being stubborn ignored all their warnings  i have this bad habit of meeting someone and when i get along with them as well as i did with max  i latch on and i just want to hang and spend all my time with them and it always ends up ending badly    back to the story  i ended up moving in with these   people  it was bloody fantastic  i had the most amazing time with them  we would spend all night and all day talking and having fun and it really did mess with my studies and sleep  i dropped studying all together and ignored it and my insomnia got worse  on may   st we planned on going out  we drank a whole lot and went to the club  my house mates and i decided to take mdma which we had bought the same day  there was   capsules and a rock  now i ve done drugs before  i do it recreationally  when i ve taken mdma i ve only ever had it in capsules so i asked to have the   capsules just because it was familiar and i get very anxious trying new things  well  we all took our share  went on the dance floor and that s all i remember  i woke up in hospital the next day and the doctor spoke to me about what was in my system  the capsules ended up being mdma  ketamine and ice  my body couldn t handle the adverse reaction and basically shut down  the doctor send me home and i had the biggest come down that i ve ever had in my life  it got around that i had taken the drugs and i got into a lot of trouble  i got banned from the uni bar and i was ashamed to show my face at uni and the colleges so i actively avoided it for about a month  during this month i ve never been so miserable  i cried everyday  i never left my room  i avoided everything and everyone  there was parties in my house and i just laid in my room and cried while the world went by  it may sound ridiculous but i haven t had a great life and the smallest things get to me    after the month  i kinda got over the overdose and went about my days  life started getting a bit better again  there were more smiles and laughter  one of my house mates during the time we lived together was terrible with money  he gets paid at      am every sunday and goes out every saturday night so usually he spends all his pay as soon as it comes in on drinks  because of this  my room mates and i had to cover his rent and food throughout the week  this lasted for a few months  things started getting worse with the guy  he gets very angry and started masking his problems with drugs  specifically weed  he would go out everyday and get really high so he didn t have to deal with his problems  my room mates and i were getting very broke trying to support him and it got to the point we couldn t anymore  he never paid us back after countless promises and he never did anything around the house  one night we got into a massive fight and i kicked him out  we stayed friends and we spoke all the time and we learnt it was better this way  we became closer not living together because we didn t have the tension and added stress      i m sorry this story jumps a lot  there s so much content that i can t really focus     i didn t realise till after i kicked him out how much i spent time with him  my other two room mates were sleeping together since the start and they would spend     of their time in bed  because of this  the room mate i kicked out and i got really close because we only had each other  after kicking him out i was very lonely  i don t deal well with being alone and i constantly need company so i feel okay  the male room mate out of the   that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her  which left me and the girl to get very close  now all these people i consider my close friends  but the girl and i became really close and spent a lot of time together  we were just friends  and that s the way i liked it  we would spend every night chatting and laughing and having a grand old time while my other roommate was off with the girl he liked  the girl he liked who studies nursing ended up leaving for placement  she had to move away for   weeks to study so he spent more time with us at the flat  i started getting more and more depressed  just little things getting to me and stuff playing on my mind  one of my biggest stresses were bills and money  our first electricity bill was close to      and that was for one month  i was so stressed about the next one that it made me really depressed  about   months after the first bill  our second one was due  about a month before i knew we would receive it i tried my hardest to start looking for ways i could pay it in case it was as high as the first  i desperately were looking for jobs  i started thinking about selling my stuff and i couldn t think of anything  so i came to the conclusion that i might not be able to pay it  and that if i could  when the next bill came out i would have to do this all over again  so i decided it might be best for me to move back to college  i ended up telling my room mates and they weren t happy about it  we got into a fight and upset me so much  i was so stressed and sad that i thought i couldn t take it anymore  so i went to my medicine draw and grabbed every pill i could find and took them  it ended up being about    different pills in total  after doing it i freaked out and called my house mates  they both had left to go to a party  the girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk  the girl was very supportive and stayed with me the entire time at the hospital  my other room mate  max  didn t visit me at all  i considered max a brother too me  i loved him dearly and i tried to do whatever i could for him to show how much i appreciate him  when he didn t visit me it really got to me and upset me  we spoke and he was angry and upset with me for doing what i did  so i left the house for over a week and stayed at the flat where i used to stay  i waited for him to calm down and i went home  i didn t want him to be angry and upset with me so i thought i would give him the space    i started seeing counsellors and psychiatrists  my counsellor helped me quite a bit  she was the first counsellor i ve actually enjoyed talking too and looked forward to seeing  we worked through my problems and she came to the conclusion that leaving the house would be for the best and she supported my decision of going back to college  so i did  after i told my room mates i was doing this they hated me  they didn t want to speak to me or see me  they said some pretty nasty things to me  and i back to them    i lost my two best friends  and my brother    it s been just over   months since i ve moved out and i m still miserable about it all  i think about them everyday and i see all their snapchat s together and it ruins me because we used to do everything together  because i left my lease i m in debt up to my eyebrows  i had to come up with a bond and   weeks rent for my college and i have to come up with money for the bills towards the house that i still haven t paid  and unable to afford  i ve taken out   loans since leaving which has put me through further debt and i don t know what to do   the last   weeks have been the worst for me  i haven t stopped crying  i ve been using drugs and alcohol to mask my responsibilities and now everything has creeped up on me  i can t stop reflecting about everything this year and the pros and cons and it s hard to see the positive ahead  i ve lost my dog  my   best friends  i m a couple thousand dollars in debt  i m failing uni and my head is so fucked up i can t think straight  suicide is constantly on my mind and i can t help but think it s the only way out  i don t know what to do or who to speak too  i can t take out anymore loans and i hate asking for help from the people i love and care about  so i m coming to reddit for some advice  some positive thoughts or anything  i m lost and hopeless and i think it s coming to the end of my time  how do i get past this  i don t think i can do this anymore     sorry for such a scattered story  there s so much that s happened that i tried to fill all the important parts and i m writing this while crying and have realised it might not make sense or it be all jumbled ,1

t3_dl4qkv,Ferkomatic,thoughts on societal view of suicide,i was thinking today on our views of suicide as a society and what we actually define as suicide  why is it ok if someone is obese and sick  eats himself into a coma everyday and dies a slow death over years  we don t say that is suicide  but if someone is otherwise a healthy individual and takes life into his own hands this isn t ok   where do we draw the line  why is it ok to die a slow painful diseased death but as soon as we take matters into our own hands it s not ok  it just seems as a society we are so very ignorant to so many things   and at least in my country  usa  they would rather have you sick  diseased  and barely alive so you can go to work and not realize the corrupt nature of it all nor have the willpower to fight back   thoughts ,1

t3_dkwkyb,iwanttodie777777,i am pathetic and i should be dead,this is gonna sound extremely pathetic but i have an imaginary girlfriend  it s the only thing that helps me cope with the fact that i am ugly and undesired   in high school  i was very self conscious around the fact that i am socially awkward and ugly  in one of my classes  i sat at a table with   girls and they all pretty much mocked me by saying something like  hey  would you date  u iwanttodie        they all started laughing pretty much in my face  i was already feeling worthless about myself  and now i m even worse  there have been many other similar incidents to this but i d rather not dig them out of my mind and bring back painful memories    now that i am in college  i avoid talking to everyone now as much as possible  i will never trust anybody anymore  people are horrible and i want no part in socializing with others just to be ridiculed and mocked    it hurts to realize that i ll pretty much live the rest of my life alone and miserable if i don t kill myself  it s clear that i am ugly and undesirable to others  most people just don t want to say it directly to my face    i want to love someone  i wish i could find someone i could hug everyday and have intimate conversations with  i wish i could find someone who is attracted to me just as much as i am to them    i am a complete burden to everyone  loneliness hurts so much when people decide to call you out on it and rub it in your face    time to spend another night crying myself to sleep in my bed   i hope reincarnation is real  hopefully when i kill myself i can reincarnate as a socially competent good looking person,1

t3_dlvka1,Amxela,i ve started writing down my depressed thoughts  figured i share so i don t have to keep it to myself  it s been a rough past few days ,depression                  am   i m sitting here after quite a few shots of rum  listening to down tempo music  the thoughts in my mind are ones longing for my existence to be over  i don t want to kill myself but i wish my life was over  the stress of this semester as well as thinking that the person i ve fallen in love with is going to leave me in about a months time makes me want to not experience any more    the reoccurring thought of me hanging by my neck in my closest replays in my mind over and over again  i would never do that to myself but that thought goes through my mind countless times a day  i don t think i m a danger to myself but i simply just wish the world would take my in my sleep  i don t think i m suicidal but i just don t want to live any more  if my death was natural it would cause less pain to the people in my life  just this past tuesday            i told the girl i have feelings for that if i were to die most people wouldn t notice for a few weeks  i don t think my roommates would notice for a few days  i personally think word to my parents would take   weeks or more and to the girl i feeling for  i don t think she would hear of my passing for a month or so    the pain that plagued my depressive thoughts comes from a mixture of felling like a failure  to not wanting to let my parents down  to stress from work and classes  i wish i didn t feel this way and that s why i wish this world would just make my death an untimely one  nearly every time i go to sleep i hope that i dint wake up in the morning and that s if i go to sleep    i wish this dull nagging pain in my mind would just end so i can live my life    the only time i feel alive is when i travel or when i m with a bunch of people i care about   even then i feel like the people i care about don t have reciprocating feelings   maybe i need help                am sitting here thinking about her again  i told myself i wouldn t get played again  i wouldn t get caught up in emotions so i won t get hurt when she leaves again  we agreed we wouldn t take it to there  she started talking about how she showed me off to her family and how her friend told her she should date me  hearing all of this i caught feelings hard again  i feel her slipping further and further away and i m not sure if it s my fault  is it because i m depressed  is it because i freaked her out with how far i ve fallen for her  is it because she found someone else  someone better  i m not sure      feeling like i m losing grasp on the person i want to love in the future on top of the stress school has me going through is making it hard for me  i want to quit  i m doing poorly in most of my classes and it s onto the real world in just a few months  i m not ready for it  if i can t get out of bed to go to an hour long class how will i be able to hold a job  i want to just curl up and not exist anymore   i don t want to kill myself because i know there are people that care about me and that would devastate them but i m honestly not afraid to die  if i went to sleep tonight and didn t wake up in the morning i don t think i d be afraid of that happening  i ve gone back to not looking both ways when crossing the street in the off chance that a distracted driver helps me escape  i m not making attempts on my life nor am i planning on doing so  i am just giving up self preservation because i don t care if i die by external sources anymore    my medication helps me sleep but it doesn t fix my depression  i don t think i need something to help me sleep i need something that stops these thoughts  i need something that puts me at ease  alcohol is not a good idea because while i feel good after drinking i hate how i feel the next day  i seem more depressed  my medication for sleep also doesn t let me drink  and sometimes some days aren t that bad and i want to have fun or have a drink with my friends but i can t because of this stupid medication    as far as the girl situation goes  as much as i want to bring it up and ask her to reaffirm that nothings wrong i don t want to make a big deal out of something if it s nothing and i don t want to come across insecure  i just wish she was upfront with me  if she doesn t want to see me don t give me excuses just tell me why you d rather not  i d understand better  i don t know how you can lie to me and tell me that you are busy with homework and want to see your little brother and then go and get high with your friend  i honestly wouldn t care if you would rather go and do that just please don t lie to me  it hurts  i miss you     i just want to sit down and talk to you    i think i m codependent and in a very bad way  i feel like nothing matters and my depression is gone when she is around and when she talks to me  lately it just seems like she doesn t want to see me or talk to me and it s making the depression come on strong  i need to fix this ,0

t3_dl63ie,Synth_Kobra,how do i know if i m being excluded or if it s all in my head ,i certainly would say i m not clingy  far from it  but when i do try to hang out or do something nobody seems to have time for me or they do things without me  i get you don t need to do every single thing with friends but this just seems like i m being avoided  i m a busy person but i make time for people i care about  so it makes sense for me to assume they simply don t consider me a close enough friend to hang out with  there is also a chance i m overthinking things  but i m really leaning towards the latter  being excluded for whatever reason   what are your experiences ,0

t3_dkdsp4,Hypophonic,some thoughts,hey i am relatively new to reddit and this sub but i thought this would be an ideal place to share some thoughts anonymously since i could never bother friends with that kind of stuff  i don t think there s any lasting happiness for me here  i always see the same selfish  worthless guy who is nothing but a bother and excess baggage to everyone in the mirror every day  i have absolutely no feeling of self worth  hoping that this would change at some event in my life  starting uni  losing    pounds  getting into reading     but it never did  i am essentially isolated now and don t talk to anyone  not that i would be able to make new friends anyways  i hate myself way too much for that and im too insecure on top of that  people would be better off if i disappeared  it s always the same  i keep living in the past back when i had a girlfriend  many friends  regularly went partying and was somewhat happy  don t get me wrong i m still a teenager   nothing of that is left anymore  i don t think i have a future ,1
t3_dkoo08,nanochick,life feels pointless  and it seems it will always be that way ,this is probably going to be pretty long  i am mainly just writing this to rant  so i don t expect anyone to actually read this  at least in its entirety  i wanted it to be somewhat chronological  but that s not how the brain works  so bare with me if some pieces don t flow well    tl dr  despite trying to live to the best of my abilities  it s always a fruitless battle    ever since i was in middle school  i ve had suicidal ideation  but never to the point where it would manifest itself into action  it was more like i was obsessed with the idea of not existing  but never really knew why  and i felt i had an okay childhood  with a bit of ups and downs  i had a mother who loved me  nice siblings  got to see my dad every other weekend  had a couple of dogs and other pets  etc    some of the more subtle things that i didn t know affected me as a kid was living below the poverty line  having separated parents  with   siblings none of which shared both of parents with me  only either from my mom or dad   living in a small city while black  being bullied for my being  too black for the white kids and too  white  for the black kids   etc    which i never thought was that bad   i ve always been a good student and a good kid  i ve never made my parents terribly upset  except for a time where i tried to  save  my older brother from school when i was   because he didn t come home at the normal time a k a  when the dora the explorer theme song came on   i ve consistently gotten good grades and have been praised at school  i did a lot of sports  played a few instruments  and entered art shows  i was my parents model child and tried to live in their best image    then  i felt as though i ve had a never ending streak of bad luck    when i was     i was raped by a family friend who was    in my house  and only found out because i kept feeling weird when i woke up in the morning  in a different room nonetheless  because i had a bad feeling  i set up the old smart phone that i had in my room as a camera when i slept  and  to spare details  caught him in the act    when i was     my mother passed away due to cancer  and i had to move in with my father  who i then discovered was pretty abusive  both physically and mentally  he would constantly beat me to the point that my glasses would break  or i d have broken blood vessels in my eyes  he made it seem like it was normal  and not a big deal  and constantly manipulated me  at that time i also became sort of an  only child  since all of my dad s kids have left the house and moved to another city  and my mother s kids were all moved out as well  as the youngest  i was the only one left  he would drink a lot and come home and get angry that there was a cup left in the dish basin and hit me  ground me for no reason  etc    a school counselor realized that i wasn t doing okay and would come to school with no glasses or blood in my eyes  and called cys  that wasn t until i was already    though  and they apparently didn t want to help me because i was too old  and i didn t have enough other bruises   when i was college bound  my father lightened up  and life seemed okay again  i ended up getting accepted into a great university to study engineering  and maintained a good gpa and participated in a lot of extracurricular activities    during my freshman year  i had a bit of ups and downs in terms of mood  eventually  i tried to commit suicide after of psychosis episode in the second semester  and had to be sent the the hospital for a few days  this caused my depression to get worse  and i felt traumatized by the experience  while at the hospital  i ve missed exams and my grades suffered  causing me to spiral more into depression  eventually  after using the university s psychological services  i ve began to recover  and started doing well in school again    then  right at the beginning of my sophomore year  i got into a really bad car accident  long story short  my  dad s  car lost control while i was driving  crossed the highway median  and slid into the opposing traffic  crashing into another car  the other person didn t survive  i was devastated  i couldn t believe that this had happened  and for the next few months  i genuinely wished that somehow i could be replaced with him  i wanted to be dead instead  i didn t want an innocent life to be gone  and i didn t don t feel i deserve to be alive instead  i ve went to therapy and started taking depression medication  because i could barely maintain the will to live  i can still even barely cope with this   five months later  i got a call from a detective  saying the state wanted to charge me with vehicular homicide  although most car accidents that end up in death don t usually result in a vehicular homicide charge unless drugs and or alcohol were used  the detective said i was going    in a    due to an electronic data recorder in my car  this made me feel hopeless  and i was certain my life was over   but i was very wary of the detective   maybe because of the already tense relationship between law enforcement and the black community  or maybe because i was certain that my very tiny     year old car couldn t even go    mph   and did some research  i eventually came to learn that the detective never actually did an accident reconstruction  and that the data he receive was flawed  a lawyer took my case pro bono  and helped me hire and actual reconstructionist  who proved that it was scientifically impossible for me to have been going that speed  and even impossible to be going anything over     if that  although this had made me hopeful  the feeling of being slandered by law enforcement  more than just the speed he alleged   the media  and the public hurt me  the case is still ongoing  and although everyone around me feels confident  i feel empty and hopeless   not to mention that i m still torn of the loss of life that resulted from the accident  on one hand  i am upset at the detective using false information to try to build a case  but on the other  i m heartbroken for the man s family  and depressed that his life was lost and not mine  it s nauseating    and now  i feel that my life is over  i used to be a good student  a good daughter  a good girlfriend  a good person in general  i was intelligent and ambitious  i wanted to cure cancer so that nobody s else mother would have to pass away like mine  i wanted to donate all of my money to help those in need have a fair opportunity at life  i wanted my family to be proud of me  i wanted to be proud of myself  and i wanted to help make the world better    but now i can t  my life is over  everything that i ve ever worked for  fruitless  i m on my last shred of will to live  there s more parts of me that say there s no point in waiting to end it all  than not  only human instinct keeps me here    but i ve never had a chance in the first place  this world is not cut out for people like me anyways  this world is not made for black women who have come from poverty  and i m constantly punished for trying to change that  i m rightfully punished for thinking it s not all pointless  because it all is pointless    thank you for reading if you did   edit  for some reason  i also cannot see you comments  but thank you for reading my story ,1

t3_dkuz0v,okaymaybelater,need to vent,i don t think i m the typical case here  i have a really strong support system  i m accomplishing my goals at the school of my dreams  i m on my way to make an impact in the world for the better  there are people who love me that i love back  people who would be devastated if i were gone   maybe sometimes it s hard for me to remember the people who love me  but i wouldn t say i ever feel unloved or unwanted    just  i can t help but feel like things are never going to be  enough   like even when i can t look at anything in my life that i would change  i m still not happy  i can get exactly what i want and i ll still end the day thinking  what was it all for   and even when i know what it s for  i ll ask   okay  then when will it feel worth it   when will enough be enough  when will it all feel worthwhile  when will i wake up to days that don t feel like a chore on the path to get to the next day  does it matter that i m not sad if i m not happy  does it matter if i m fine     of the time when that    feels so much worse than the    feels good  when i feel  okay  but it really seems like i feel  nothing   when i have to take   pills a day just to get to  okay  anyway  just to be functional  when will i stop feeling like an ungrateful piece of shit for not being happy with my privileged life  when will i stop feeling bored  and useless  and guilty  and wanting    idk  i don t think i could ever do it  i just wish someone would give me permission to stop  if my mom told me i didn t have to do this anymore   that i could flip a switch and have it be done with and it wouldn t hurt anybody  it would be different  that ll never happen  though  so i have to keep going  i just wish i could want to stay alive for myself ,1
t3_dlapts,TheBoxofReddit,tonight is the plan,ive been wanting to do this for two years  i ve said so many bad things to people  i ve treated people like shit all my life    my girlfriend and i broke up yesterday  she wants someone who didn t hurt her like i did  over the month we were together  i was trying so hard to be better than i was since       i constantly blew her off and never gave her the time of day  acknowledging her love for me over the years  and completely disregarding that fact  i have the note ready  i have a few songs planned to release tonight as a  farewell   i just have no idea how or where im going to do it  i have an idea to use some rope like restraints i used during sex  but i honestly don t want to suffer and idk how it would be if i hang strangle myself  despite doing it half assed with cords  i just want all this madness to be over  i want something reliable  i don t want to somehow survive this attempt and suffer life changing injuries  even worse  i don t want anyone to somehow find out and send me to a mental ward and have no control over what happens  as i also am a minor  after all ,1
t3_dkmsse,TheSmilingDog,i know i m going to commit suicide  i don t know when it will happen but it s becoming closer and closer ,to start this off because i know it ll be long here s a little about me  i m an    year old atheist  shy male who s bisexual and severely hates life    not hate but rather am exhausted of it  i have major depression and have attempted suicide in my past multiple times and i have absolutely zero self esteem value  i m sorry because i know this is a long post     i really never thought i d share this to the whole world on the internet but i feel i need to get it out  i know i m going to kill myself  i can t see any other way around this  my life is either intense feelings of anguish and thoughts of inadequacy screaming in my head at my worst and then when i m  normal  it s the total lack of feeling anything  i don t feel pride  i don t feel happiness  i don t feel ambition  just a hazy fog of numbness with sadness in the background    where do i begin  my dad left me when i was middle school because he was abusive and chose heroin over his family  i was bullied relentlessly in middle and high school  i was cheated on in a relationship of two years  and my last relationship ended with them telling me my feelings  were taxing   you d think when i get home it d be better  no  my mom tells me things i supposedly lie about when it legitimately wasn t me then justifies it with  you lied before so i can t trust you  but she never puts the effort to trust me  she belittles me by insulting me  she tells me i m a disappointment  embarrassment  how she and my brother don t won t me to live with them  that if i  ask for pity  by telling my grandmother how depressed i am that she ll expose me for every wrong doing i ve made  and how my relationship ended because it was my fault  this is just from today  she says the same and more things to me every  single  day  both my brother and mom tell me how they hate me and how much of a burden i am to the both of them  my mom frequently reminds me how she didn t want children in the first place so  to have me be so inconsiderate is just an insult   the only thing she shows off about me is my shitty art  but it feels like she s just trying to show me off like i m a pretty dog at a dog show    it s more to show off her then it is my capability to draw  there s so much more i can say but i don t want to waste anyone s time    at this point in life in life i know i m going to kill myself  maybe not today but possibly tomorrow  a week from now but the time is becoming closer and closer  i already cut myself  my mom screamed at me and told me how it should be her or my brother who cuts themselves over me which just prompted me to hide it more and cut deeper   well more like mutilate since my arm is absolutely destroyed  i wake up and get screamed at  i go to bed after getting screamed at  my mom tells me depression is just an attempt at invoking pity and that i m  an entitled little bitch   every thought of inadequacy i have is just reinforced to the point where it s my own voice screaming st me in my head how worthless and shitty of a human being i am    i just    can t bear this burden any longer  i m sick of having these thoughts  i m sick of being yelled at  i want to cry for help  i want to tell my family but i don t want to be an embarrassment to everyone else by having myself exposed  my mom tells my family how my dreams are just lies to shut people up and the worse part is they believe her    they have no clue the things she says to me and what happens at my house other then from her view and i can t change anything about it  why i write this is because i don t know how much longer i plan to stay here  death is scary but it s an escape  that s all i want  as selfish as this but what little friends i have  i m willing to leave them  they d understand why i did it  they wouldn t be happy but they wouldn t blame me  i just am exhausted  i want to be happy doing things i used to enjoy  i want to have the capability of having prolonged happiness rather then a fleeting sense of it followed by disappointment and self deprecation  i want to feel like i belong  like i have a place in this world and that these thoughts aren t true  but i don t have any of that  i m planning on cutting myself really deep on both my arms and hanging myself  it s shameful to admit but i almost feel a sense of happiness about what i m going to do  again i don t know when  but it s going to happen  but that time is becoming tenuously thin    if you have questions down below  feel free to ask me  there s more i want to write but i feel silly i m making this to begin with ,1

t3_dlipll,dylandarko16,i ve been listening to  the origin of my depression  by uboa and it s actually been very comforting ,i imagine most people have heard of this album through theneedledrop so think of this post as a sort of personal review since i use music like this for comfort when i m at my lowest   before i explain myself i need to be clear here  this album is dark  and not like listen before i go by billie eilish or anything like that  this album comes from a very  very personal place for uboa  the artist herself  at from what i understand was a very difficult time in her life  the sound is very sparse and ambient at times and shrieking and intense at others  it feels more like the soundtrack to a well paced horror movie  it s scary in a way few things can achieve and forces you to confront all these emotions in a way that is terrifyingly accurate and often uncomfortable  if you don t find comfort in dark depressing music i honestly think you should ignore this album despite how good it is imo   this album is incredibly dark and intense and i would only recommend it if you use music as a form of comfort and enjoy ambient industrial music  if you want an idea without listening to it  watch anthony fantano s review it s a good summary   to put it simply  this album contains blood curdling screams  glitchy ambience and strange samples that make it an album that has the ability to give you a panic attack  which it can and has done to me  but despite that so many moments on this thing left me breathless and beside myself  it s atmospheric as fuck and uboa has zero trouble facing her problems head on and she clearly put everything into making it   imo the biggest pros to this album are two things       the sound  when this album becomes distorted and glitchy it s uncomfortable but never unlistenable and the ambience hits you directly and can make anything and everything else fade away around you  the opening of the title song floors me every time  it s the kind of music that you need to listen to alone  in a room  at night for it to truly hit you  it s also worth mentioning that the album captures a lot of the moods that depression can take   quiet and reflective but also overwhelming and tormenting      the lyrics  honestly some of the best i ve ever listened to in an album that deals with these topics  the lyrics essentially act as stanzas of poetry that are either quietly and carefully delivered or screamed like the desperate cries of a murder victim  whichever one it is  they make the entire atmosphere of the album feel hopeless and weary in the best way possible and there are some disturbing  relatable and genuinely sad ideas on display  with titles like  please don t leave me  and  detransitioning  it s pretty clear that uboa is working through some stuff with it but in a way where the listener can twist it to fit their own feelings    it s about    minutes long and i d say worth a listen  if you are at that point where you can t sleep or just alone and having a really intense episode  this album can be comforting  i ve had it on for the last week along with deathconsciousness  another good album btw  and it s pretty overpowering    if you use music as a comfort i d seriously give this one a listen but be prepared for some intense sounds  emotions and production or this will knock you flat ,0
t3_dlcd14,jackbutt37,nothing makes sense,does anyone else feel like just nothing in their life makes sense  like everything about my life feels wrong and honestly it may just be better to end my life  everyone talks about finding what you enjoy and following that but there is nothing i enjoy  just daily tasks become hell because i have to put on my smiling face and act like my life is as amazing as people seem to think it is  i have no direction and at this point i m just tired of being a failure ,0
t3_dl5nhl,Debbie1300,life is not worth it ,i don t care about anyone or anything or what  i desire  what i love  what i want in this life what anyone has or that anyone is moving forward than me and is more successful than  me and has what they want in life because life is not worth it  i m done wasting time on things that don t benefit me and make me feel worse and my expectations are never met because reality sucks and is a total bummer  i m so unimportant and upset that i can t cope with life and i don t care about any opportunities that come my way or anything people have to offer or say because i feel so offended by life and that i think to myself why do i bother living and i feel guilty that i do  i really don t care if i m alone or have no one because nobody accepts me for who i am  i don t feel as enthusiastic and excited as i once was because life is so meaningless and boring and that everyone is joking and having a good spending time by spending time with others they love while i lay lifeless into darkness and despair  i don t care about being happy because i don t deserve to be  i don t care about success because i always fail to reach it  nobody cares about me because i m practically worthless  because who would want a girl like me around when i could be better but i m not  no one would help me or even talk to me because i have no value and i don t matter in this life and that i bother people by existing and that life would be better if i was one less problem for people to not worry about  i don t care about love because it s not true and know i will never get it  my thoughts and feelings aren t worth it because they get worse everyday as well as i m bored and tired of life that is also making me feel worse i don t care if i don t eat to improve my health i don t care if i don t have a great family or friends by my side  i don t care if society pays attention to me or ignores me because i can t stand life  i don t care how much i keep everything inside just to break down in frustration emotional angst because i m not taken seriously and i accept it  because being invisible is what i do best  i don t own life anything because i m sick and tired of people using me to their advantage and simply putting down by going on top of me  to be honest i mess everything up  i m weak and sensitive and use my anger to hide my sadness in order to make myself seem like i m strong in front of people when i m really not  i can t get over the fact that life doesn t give a shit about me and hates me and nobody cares how i feel  and i regret living by waking up everyday alive feeling worthless  unloved and unwanted  i m pushed down and insulted because i m a loser and will never get to be successful no matter how hard i try  i have no one that i can trust that is on my side because my family and friends despise me so much  i m an invisible nervous wreck  i m so afraid of being a failure and an embarrassment in society because i feel like i should better myself but instead i stay average  i think about dying everyday because that s all i look forward to is waiting for my body to stop working and not taking any oxygen  seriously life is killing me in my head and i m so hopeless and emotionally broken  no one likes me or knows me because they have someone or something to focus on and spend time with and i dont  all i do i stay inside  when i go outside people fail to understand me because they can t relate to me and i feel so alone  i m always thinking others are better off without me because life moves on and everyone only cares about themselves  it s never about the pain and suffering i feel because nobody takes me seriously and to be honest no one will ever have time for me help me support me etc  i am the worst girl to have ever been born and i really want to stop feeling like this but i tried everything to make myself feel better and it s not working  i m always in a cruddy upset mood  and will always be tied to my problems and the condition of how i feel  i dont want life forcing me to live  f ck this society   i just want peace quiet and death to happen i m only hurting myself by living ,0

t3_dlf2m9,madgif90,my dads last visit made me feel suicidal after he left,i m telling my dad i felt suicidal after his last visit when he left  he had an affair with my current stepmom years ago  it was      and i was    little sister was    when he left and moved into an apartment    when he moved       miles away from our hometown near seattle all the way to germany to live with my german stepmom  no  it s not cool   and    when he married his affair  due to my confusion and anger that he was replaced with a live in nanny  read  someone who was not my dad  i set fire to some of the nanny s personal belongings and had to enter children s psychiatric hospital for a few months or weeks  can t remember how long exactly    i ve had relationship problems since i started dating in high school  my last three exes were toxic and manipulative and i m finally actually single and happier that way  however i m now facing my dad issues  finally  he and my stepmom had my half brother who is    years younger than me so idk how to relate to him  and he s gotten all the attention i never got so i m jealous  i do have aspergers which doesn t help how i think about all of this    over the years we ve definitely had phone calls and been to germany more times than i can count  and he s visited us here  recently instead of yelling at and blaming him for being such a shitty dad by moving       miles away for another woman  i actually opened up and explained that my black and white thinking is contributing to my point of view  this talk was at the beginning of a   day visit last september  the rest of his trip to see us was great  no problem  normally i d ghost him halfway through because it hurt too much to think about him leaving us again  this time i saw him every day for a few hours or more  the last day before he drove to the airport was ok but sad  then depression hit that night  then the next night came and i was a fucking mess    i had been driving around all day and finally parked my car at my apartment  thought about driving more but decided i better not because i didn t feel so great emotionally  suddenly i had a meltdown and pounded my fists on the steering wheel while screaming and sobbing  i felt hopeless and completely empty  my mom died in      from a    year battle with thyroid cancer  and even that didn t hurt like this did  i felt as if my dad ripped my heart out  i felt hollow  like there was nothing emotional for me to hold on to  instead of driving anymore i went inside  after using the bathroom and drying my hands  i imagined hanging myself from the hand towel  then i thought of using my x acti knife used for origami to cut myself  then i thought of getting drunk  then i thought of overdosing on my anxiety depression meds  at some point in these thoughts i also thought about calling the hospital on myself  instead of doing any of these things i ate dinner and followed my usual bed time routine but took two extra meds to sleep  it took a week to start coming out of that dark hole of depression    i ve told my therapists and those who know me best and are closest to me  my sister and i cried on the phone and in person  i m getting a new psychiatrist soon so i can get a meds checkup  my old psychiatrist hasn t been covered by my insurance for a few years and is now retired   i have a plan i made with my weekly therapist    my dad doesn t know yet but i m going to tell him how triggered i get when i feel abandoned by him  i have a long way to go to heal this lifelong wound  i m     and i think telling him about these thoughts would help make room for healing  i also think he should know how much he affects me still    i still definitely get tempted to do stupid things like crash my car but i m still here because of my sister  i couldn t imagine leaving her with the pain of losing our mom and losing a sibling  she knows she s the reason i m still here and has said several times how grateful and lucky she is to have me as a sister and that i m still in her life  she recently went through med school applications and i never doubted her for a second  and she said she doesn t know how she would have gotten through it without me   i compare myself to my sister because of how well she and our dad get along and because she doesn t have a disability holding her back from anything  however i also compare myself to my stepmom because i mean  he left us for her  i asked if he moved to germany to get away from mom or for our stepmom and he said  no  i moved there for her   stab me in the back again  why don t you  got enough scars  whats one more   so yeah i m telling him about my suicidal thoughts and getting help  my exes didn t make me feel this shitty though  and i still cut them out

t3_dkgsiy,nightsister888,you can t talk about it ,i ve struggled with my mental health for my entire life and everything i ve ever read has said to be open about it and have a support system and what not  thing is  no one that cares about you wants to know that you want to kill yourself  they can t change how you feel so what s the point in stressing them out  i promised myself  to talk about it after my boyfriend found me carving myself up one time because i had been bottling everything up and i felt so awful for putting him through that completely out of the blue  well i m having a hard time with those thoughts again and i just confided in a loved one and watching her face change and try to find a way to help me when she knows she can t just made it so much worse  i shouldn t have said anything ,1

t3_dkzodm,Maddox_17,what s the point anymore ,i struggle to find reason in my life  every day i get up and glaze by half assed barely passing and doing just enough to stay afloat in my education  when i get home i immediately walk into the wreck of a house and get ready for bed  i often spend around eighteen hours in and out of sleep  laying there all the time i do nothing but look back at my rather short life  involving sexual  physical  and more importantly mental abuse  addiction to prescription meds as well as being on and off so damn many that doctors described me as in a constant manic state  being in and out of facilities more times than i can count  and even being there while watching my father die at an rather early age of thirty four to a condition that would have taken his life at an earlier frame of time if not for his lung transplant  having said condition as well  mimics cystic fibrosis  i never find comfort in simple tasks such as breathing  constantly my lungs feel heated from what i can only guess is a multitude of lung infections   and today i find myself in constant pain and inflammation  only recently has the majority of my already torn family found equal footing in hating me  and what can i say  i am a rather spiteful dick   constantly i ask myself when this will end   it s been seventeen years on this earth and slowly but surely the years get worse   at this point i m rooting for my condition to kill me  god knows i ve tried and that only made things worse  now i got ptsd from a previous suicide attempt along with all other bits of mental issues from watching death and abuse  and i find myself thinking about suicide everyday ,1
t3_dlozpy,nikkihiddenfeel,newcomer here,hello all  it s actually the first time i post a comment in reddit and feel somewhat akward  i am     female and two weeks ago i was diagnosed with clinical depression  i have this heavy feeling in my chest like i can t breathe  i am always so tired to do the easiest of everyday tasks   and spend my days laying in bed  curtains closed all day long crying or sleeping  seems like nothing is interesting to me  my friends busy within their lives and every night i fall asleep praying i wont wake up to face another day  i started sessions with a clinical therapist hoping to avoid pills or my parents putting me into an institution but really  do you all honestly believe that therapy can solve the problem  i mean i ask for your honest opinion    does therapy work  will this ever go away     recently realised that over the years i had those same symptoms from time to time but never thought it was something psychological so the doctor couldn t find anything wrong with me physically  this could probably mean i had depression since then and somehow it comes and goes from time to time but everytime harder ,0

t3_dlufdv,EllieZomZom,treated poorly in hospital,i was taken to a  amp  e after i attempted suicide by taking too many tablets plus alcohol  it was really quit  the nurses even said so  despite this i was treated as low priority  made to wait a long time  i was left alone for long periods of time  despite crying hysterically and asking for company as i was afraid i d hurt myself  i left my cubicle to go to the bathroom  and found   nurses standing around drinking coffee  like it was a mental health thing so it didn t matter  i gathered up my things and left  plenty of nurses saw and did nothing  i could have killed myself and they didn t give a crap  i was there   hours and all they did was blood pressure  made me feel so worthless ,1
t3_dlrvvm,scarlet-lily,trying not to compare,i ve been working on myself because i recognized a lot of these were coming from a well inside of me  a deep  dark existential kind of dread based on self image  past experience  and concern about the future  animosity and jealousy take over in most of my interactions with people who are close to me  i constantly feel the need to argue and get this shaky feeling throughout my body  nervous that i m going to explode with rage or say something i will regret  particularly with the person i thought was maybe is my best friend  i just distance myself so much and don t let them in  then react so i don t have a clue anymore  maybe we don t relate as well as i once thought    maybe that s my depression   for me  the old adage  comparison is the thief of joy  has never been more relatable  and yet  i haven t been able to alter my thoughts  i m in therapy  i m prescribed meds  i m engaging in pro social  self care  activities  it doesn t feel like enough and i constantly question why  cycling between thoughts of  why am i doing this  why am i like this   and guilt for my reactivity    i m just over it  making myself feel small  guilty  less than  useless  worthless    and i guess the most frustrating part is trying to figure out compared to what ,0

t3_dlbe3l,raventth5984,it feels like a constant  painful battle ,i feel like it is a constant battle with my mind to struggle against horribly destructive habits   they are too ingrained in me after years  and it feels like a constant battle  using new tools i have been learning from competent therapists to fight against the bad thought and feeling patterns that would suck me down into a black hole of despair  only to leave me withdrawn and paralyzed with misery and fear   it makes me feel constantly anxious  and it is exhausting and draining   it is discouraging to think that it will always feel like this  i do not always want to be fighting against my unhealthy self that has persisted for years   it terrifies me that the battle will never go away  or become more bearable  or that it will take too long of a time for things to become  easier  for me to exercise more positive self care habits   i am fighting very hard to not beat myself up here on this post   about how many years i feel like i have lost because of feeling stuck with incompetent  selfish therapists  and not realizing at the time just how bad their lazy  methods  were for me at the time   it was only shallow comforting and instant gratification that i received from that  therapy  instead of more long term  useful tools for better  positive health and self healing   this constant struggle brings me close to feelings of wanting to just give up   to just give in and consider suicidal options  that is how exhausting and frightening this process has been for me at times   but i have still been fighting against that  i feel so lost ,1

t3_dlq1bk,de4dsoon,methods,lately  i have grown to realize that my life is beyond repair and that all my attempts to save myself consistently fall flat  i just want to be a nice person and make others happy but i was predestined to have everyone turn their back on me  so i finally took the initiative to end the pain myself  i don t have a date or method in mind yet  but i know it needs done    humans are social creatures by default  no matter how many times you say it  nobody wants truly wants to be alone  everyone needs at least   person who will love them no matter what  i have nobody  there isn t a single soul on this planet who would let me live if they were given the chance to kill me and get away with it  i have no friends  my teachers don t like me  my parents family know that my birth was a mistake  my dad has encouraged my suicide before  and now i ll finally have the chance to make someone happy     i was recently diagnosed with ptsd  it explains why since my trauma i feel like my brain has been warped to the point where i ll never experience a coherent thought ever again  i won t go one day without having a panic attack  who knows how many days and therefore panic attacks i have left if i don t choose the number myself  we euthanize animals when it s been decided for them that there is too much anguish for them to live a good quality of life  and i know what s best for myself because i feel the pain today and and know what i have looking forward   i m     i don t want to spend the next       years of my estimated lifespan waking up in the morning and facing the pain i feel today over and over again until i die of natural causes  the time i have left naturally is too long to just tough it out    so  like i said earlier  i need to get some things straightened out    a firearm is the perfect exit route  quick  easy  and hard to mess up  if only i had one or knew someone who did  i can t do this because i can t even buy one until i m legal    drowning and hanging are tricky because someone will have to find me and they have a low success rate  i would feel guilty about a stranger having to see that   cutting overdosing are also not reliable enough  i m a cutter and i know that i would probably back out and give up because i wouldn t be able to cut deep enough   jumping from a tall building is likely to work and doesn t require much to execute  but like i said earlier  i would feel bad for the person who found me   i wish i knew someone with a gun  what i wouldn t give   ,1
t3_dlu6f8,throwawafjfiridjfa,i was born under the idea that if i be a good person others will be good,i ve spent money and time on my bullies  people who hate me  friends  family  and unfortunately nothing has come around yet  how long do i need to wait before i give up  because at the moment it has been multiple years and nothing has happened to me that has positively impacted me  and because of this i do not consider myself in a stable position in life,1
t3_dlc2zc,matheman42,wanting to not exist is not selfish   ,i get people use this argument but why is anyone else s sadness a reason why you can t end your suffering  if i really think it would be worth it to not be here why is it anyone  else s decision  shouldn t people argue more to find my own happiness instead of guilting me for potentially making others sad if i were gone  seems like a crappy argument and i just want a better perspective than my mind is giving me   thanks in advance for any good perspectives,0

t3_dldsrm,RandomIncursions,just remember this truth is also mine and many others ,just remember this truth is also mine and many others  you re really not alone  the world just makes us feel that way    i love you  and im sorry for your pain  i really am  i feel the pain too in different ways but its still pain and it still is unbearable many times  this is why i can say that i do feel bad and sympathize empathize  i have darkness that is unbelievable painful and i know you do too  i wish i had something better to give you than words because you need something great as i do  i know this  but i admire you for every second you are still trying even when you are also giving up  all we have is our struggle  and i think maybe our struggle is what s making us strong enough to keep going  i just hope you find peace and i do as well  i know it may seem universally away and unlikely but im right here on this planet with you and telling you i love you and i hope you can find peace and happiness someday ,0
t3_dlf3kv,FormallyGrim,i don t know what to do anymore,i thought i was getting better  i was feeling happy  purposeful  and doing everything right  i was doing things that was making people proud  but i can t stop feeling bad now  i don t want to leave bed  i don t know what i want to do anymore  all of this feels so pointless  how can i build a life when nothing makes me happy   there are moments when i m distracted and with people that i don t feel so bad  but then the same thoughts and feelings creep in and ruin it  i don t know what to do  i thought that if i worked harder enough in uni and bettered myself i would feel better but i don t  i feel worse  i just want to go but there s no where to go  i feel trapped  i feel like every time i try to dig myself out of this i just go deeper,0
t3_dlsxc0,latenightread22,lazy,i was on the phone and opening up to my mom about how i ve been in a funk lately and that it feels like my depression is slowly creeping back in and how i could cry at the drop of a hat over the smallest thing and how my motivation to do basic things is dwindling  she said give me an example  so i said  for instance  there could be a multitude of things i need to get done such as doing a load of laundry  wiping down the counters  cleaning my bathroom   it can all be staring me in the face and i have no gumption ti tackle it  as if it s a mental block and i d rather sit on the couch or watch tv then do what needs to be done   her response was  what s the difference between that and being lazy  ,0
t3_dkrb6v,wasted16yrold,why am i like this ,im plagued by violent thoughts every single day  anything and everything can set me off  there s a renovation happening in my house now and every little thump or drilling noise makes my mind flood with awful thoughts  on tuesday i heard something falling upstairs and i was stuck on the mental image of pushing my mother down a flight of stairs  her body tumbling down and breaking bones on each step  the drills working for hours on end make me unwillingly think of basically crucifying myself against my room s wall  i don t want to live like this  i don t want these thoughts  i don t want to be a potential danger to others  i don t know how to stop them ,1
t3_dlctie,thatgothboy,pointless,everything is pointless  nobody loves me  or even likes me  i try to make friends and for what  one conversation either stays and ends at one conversation  or i get attached to them and then they leave because they get tired of me  and the worst part is i can t even fucking blame them  who wants to deal with a schiozophrenic piece of shit that can t have just one normal day  who wants to deal with someone so insufferable and unlikeable that he can t even have just one loyal friend  who wants to deal with a pathetic whore  every guy i meet just uses me like i m a toy and that would be fine if they were clear about their intentions instead of leading me on to think different  but of course they don t do that  it s not like i would turn them down if they were clear anyway because i m just that desperate and lonely   i m just a stupid  ugly  worthless  disgusting whore and i deserve to die and if i blow my brains out right now not a single person would blink because my existence is just that pointless   i m tired of everything  i m tired of being used tired of my stupid fucking voices tired of people lying to me tired of breathing tired of existing i just want it all to stop and i want to stop breathing and quit being held hostage by thisfucking stupid body and mind   ,1
t3_dlatrk,throwawaync537,money and being assaulted,ive lived so much of my life poor  not iphone and cheap car poor  but no food for days  no roof over my head poor    i was tossed out as a teenager  breaking into cars to try and stay warm  going into the woods to start small fires when i couldn t feel my fingers   during this time i escaped any way i could  drugs  and alcohol  at    life was already too much  for me  i wish i would ve quit life then   in my late teens my biological mom found me  she lived     miles away  but drove to come pick me up  it was like winning the lottery  i had a home  new clothes  and someone who loves me   it lasted about two months  then i was kicked out  but this time i had cousins and people who were happy i was around  i was able to stay over  i got a job  life seemed okay    fast forward a few years  and the only jobs i found were dead end  fast food and phone rooms  i go through my twenties not able to keep up with bills  i ruined my credit  and have never owned anything in my life    a couple weeks ago there was a ted talk on the tv  people talking about rape an trauma  it brought it all back  i can t shake it  i keep thinking of the asshole who sexually assaulted a homeless teenager   so i try and do something about it  i call an sasp sexual assault service provider  they give me some info  point me in the right direction  and i finally call the local police to report the crime    he takes a statement  making me to through everything that happened to me more than once  then says he doesn t know when it will be investigated but someone will eventually call me   i look up the statute of limitations where it happened and i missed my window by   years  nothing is going to happen    so i m still poor  i still don t know why i exist  and my abuser doesn t have to answer for his crimes  i want to quit   i mean the majority of my life has been horrible  why tf do i have to keep living it   just another    or    years of misery  for what   so someone else might not get sad  i m fucking done  i m fucking done   life s not fair  so why cant i just quit early,1

t3_dlo2kn,asadghoul,i m a bad person,i am genuinely a bad person   i claim my parents are abusive but what if i m the abusive one  i never come out of my room and snap when they try to talk to me  yes i claim it s because my room makes me feel safe and i m an introvert  but really i m just refusing to spend time with people who let me live in their home  my parents    i lie to them daily by telling them i m with friends but going to see my boyfriend  i m not allowed to date despite being a high school graduate and     they would probably send him to jail so i have to lie  but still  i m so ungrateful and sneaky and have spun so many webs to prevent them from finding out because i am so in love with this boy and plan on spending my life with him    besides the point  though  my mom trusts me and looks out for me and yet i lie to her face  daily  i have sex  daily  their little nice daughter  secretly a whore  i m a waste of their money and thought  i wasn t worth raising  all i do is disobey them    i also skip college class near daily to see him  i keep my grades up  but still  i choose to do the assignments and skip the lectures  im directly disrespecting the teachers  one of the teachers told my group i think i m too good for school    also  i spend almost    dollars every single day  quickly draining my savings  on food that i throw up  there are people starving and here i am  throwing up   i m a bad person ,0

t3_dlb6a6,ishovedcolaupmynose,i feel so unloved and invisible ,i know no one s gonna see this  let alone read through it  but whatever  i just want to vent for a little bit   i m so sick of appearing as non existent to everyone  people around my age are in stable relationships or are already getting married and having kids  i can t even say i have   friend  i ve no one to talk to  the only friendship i ve had in my life in middle school i recently realized to have been toxic  but at the time it was all i had  now  i have nothing  i didn t make any friends in high school  so i thought maybe i would in college  i m halfway through college and i have no friends still  i ve tried so hard over the last few years to befriend people and nothing ever came out of it  i always got ignored  in high school  i invited the entire class for my birthday and had like a huge table reserved  but only   person showed up  been celebrating alone at home since because no one ever remembers my birthday anymore or cares  i ve been so afraid of being alone for the rest of my life  but now i feel like that s coming true  i never leave the house unless i have to go to class or get something else done  every time i try to connect with someone  i just feel out of place  i keep telling myself maybe in the future at the workplace i d be able to make a friend  but at this point i know it s not gonna happen  i feel like i m not compatible with anyone  no one ever remembers me anymore and it just hurts getting ignored all the time  i ve been trying to open up to people lately but i keep getting shit on by people so i guess i m just gonna go back to being closed off and emotionless  not that it worked great last time  but i don t really have much of an option  this whole year has been a bust  i ve hardly done anything  i feel like i ve improved in a lot of aspects  but on nights like these it just comes down crashing back to me  i don t know if anything s changed for the better  but i m clearly doing something wrong when i have nobody in my life that i talk to anymore  i ve never been close to my family either  i ve always felt some kind of disconnection between us  and i don t see myself being close to them ever because they ve always shut me off whenever i d talk about something i m going through so i feel like no one really understands me anymore  many years ago i would ve wanted things like money and a big house but now i just want a single friend  it s sad when i feel like even something as small as that is not in the cards for me  everything i do to do improve  no one notices  on top of that i keep getting told i m wasting my time on useless things for hobbies i actually like and learn from  i wish i could disappear because i know no one would notice  hell  as of late  i ve hardly been able to feel anything at all myself  i m just empty inside  waiting for the next day to come  go to class and get back  repeat  i don t feel loved by anybody and everyone is just so much better than me  i honestly hope it doesn t come true  but right now i do see myself living like this for the rest of my life  alone and all that  i could kill myself right now and i know no one would even notice besides my parents just because they live with me  i see so many people and their friends showing them so much love and always being around them but that s never happened to me  i don t have anyone to lean onto and just cry  i really want to hug someone but i ve got no one  it s so sad that i had this dream of kissing this random person  but didn t feel anything  then i asked for a hug instead and it felt so amazing  i don t know when s the last time i ve hugged someone like that  even one person being nice to me can make my day  but every time i enter a new circle  i try my best to interact with people and befriend them and just end up getting ignored very quickly  the next day  everyone is already somehow magically best friends with each other and they talk about everything  and tell each other how much they love each other  meanwhile i have like   contact saved on my phone  i don t get why i would be even alive anymore  there s just no point to it  i m just skimming through life without feeling anything or being with anyone  i know no one cares about me or loves me  but i wish it were otherwise  i just want to feel loved for once  but no one even notices me or what i m going through  i want a friend i can talk to about everyday stuff  play games with  go out and have fun or just do nothing but chill  but i know it s never going to happen  as far as relationships or getting married  that has absolutely no chance of ever occurring because i m not very attractive in my opinion and i d probably get dumped quickly  i work out at home because i m anxious to go to the gym because i think everybody will stare at me for not looking as good as i probably should be looking at this age  and even when i work out a lot  my family and people at school college have kept reminding me about how much i should work out instead of not doing anything with my life and get a girlfriend  so it doesn t matter what i do or how hard i try  people will always see negative things about me  no one ever appreciates me or what i do  and even when i try to talk about things i like i always get  uh huh   and the conversation ends there  now  i understand not being interested in what i like  that s totally understandable  but what i mean is  often times people will just make me feel like i m dumb for liking something and that s it s useless  i just want to give up at this point with all the things i ve liked and done because i m just not getting anywhere  i just want to die and get this over with already  i used to be religious  but then gave up on it  but now what with having no one else to turn to  i sometimes feel like resorting to god again if it meant getting some things off my chest  but i don t know man    i m not sure if i m even worth saving at this point  i know i probably sound like an idiot  but i m just tired of dealing with depression for almost a decade now  i m just straight up worthless  i probably should ve taken one out of the many chances i ve had of killing myself in high school  but i didn t  hoping it d get better one day    except it never did  i m just so hurt and fed up with everything   anyway  sorry for rambling  at this point i don t even know what i m saying  but i m open to talk to anyone if someone s up for it  if not  whatever  all good ,0

t3_dllvy2,silenttigersteps,i fucking hate my life and looking forward to shoot myself one day ,i fucking hate everything on this world  from the beginning of my teenage years of    years  everything rotated around and turned into miserable shit that i have to suffer from every single day  now i m eightteen and shit hasn t changed from the tiniest bit  fuck all of the scums who say  everything will be better bro    just love yourself bro   the right people and so will come along just wait bro   these are the kind of people who don t know what it s like to be depressed and destroyed to the ground  the repetitiveness of every single day  month and year just tires me out to the point i just can t take it anymore  i feel the hate  my loneliness  my anger  more and more as time passes that i can t be assed with to get outside anymore  i hate school and don t want to go there anymore even if it s my last year before graduation but i still force myself to see one big crowd of canned piss at one place   i never used to had any true or loyal friends in my entire life reaching back to kindergarten times and that already sucked  i m not a great conversationist to woo people into my direction but i m not the weird nerd type either  no one visited my birthday parties  i never went out to play neither do activites with other kids  i was always the loner from the beginning of elementary to now who no one wanted to talk to  i for real cannot remember anything positive and memorable in my life other than slitting myself like a violin on new years eve at midnight and whimpering through the year how absolute shit my life is  love life is non existent  girls laugh their asses off telling i look like    or    when i m actually    as mentioned and my height         seems also too problematic for them since everyone of them is either tall as me or even more taller  had only one long distance but it didn t last much and she lied and dated multiple men behind my back to ultimatively dumping me  taking advice from people who say to wait for the right one will level you up to a age    virgin wizard if that s what you want  i find it unbelievable that the majority of people aren t redpilled and still live like in a disney dream world  fuck relationships these days because i don t care anymore  i see no reason to get into romance with these emotionally driven children anymore  this school year i developed an unnecessary crush on a girl in my class which makes it even more depressing for me  i doubt she even likes me back but who the fuck would like me anyway  i never had a crush have mutual feelings and all i received was rejection from getting all my rejection fearing shit together to confess to them  while the girls i have absolutely no interest to chase me down instead  i m fairly attractive from ratings of people  today was an extremely shit day and i felt so completely done  overwhelmed and couldn t concentrate at all  couldn t answer the questions the teachers asked me in class and did everything wrong  she probably thought what an idiot am i so why give me attention   highschool is complete bullshittery  no one liked me there when i switched my school and came over to them  survived half a year in there getting told into my face that no one likes me till at one point right before the end of the school year i got falsely accused out of nowhere as an school shooter from someone i don t know of  some guys had spread false rumors about me being a school shooter which caused half the population of the school refusing to come the next day  principal and teachers forced me to go apologize infront of the class for a believed lie about me  told them to fuck off and got suspended from the school  had to deal with cops  stuff went fine as i was innocent anyways  the dickheads got busted out instead  but for the cost of my reputation my entire city hates me now and spits on me wherever i walk  i m also not allowed to enter the area around their school anymore  no true friends  no support  nothing but only hate filled text messages i receive from random people time to time  someone came one night over to the entrance door to my apartment and destroyed it by throwing rocks and bashing on it  all the   people who told me they re here back in the days i used to talk to vanished from me and pretend i don t exist anymore  there you go  true friends we can call that  i was so over by that point i tried to commit suicide three times in a row on the following new year on midnight  failed all of them and instead had some retarded johaniters call me on phone to try to assign me to their sanatorium  by the way in my country showing any history of issues like these and you re guaranted to have no career lol  i m fine in school and my grades are okay and aren t affected by my issues   so i talked my way out of them and continued to live like always  i wish i could have had a gun on that moment   it would make the work so much easier just thinking about it  then i finally wouldn t be here anymore but only a flying spirit wandering this depressing world over the clouds   fast forwarding one year later to today and shit still isn t anything worth  on the other side stuff has calmed down and i get ignored and disliked by the entire population in my city  living a normal gray normie life though filled with loneliness  sadness  being alone and without any motivation  literally zero people in my life  i never talk  family is the typical eastern european toxic family that doesn t have depression in their dictionary  my parents mocks me why i still don t have a girlfriend at my age and mum tries to transform me into a complete beta by telling me to be mr  niceguy on a whole new level to girls  shoving toxic masculinity onto me is also okay for her  she doesn t want to understand today s females and thinks we re still here in the   s  i don t spend any time with my family and go on my own instead since i feel too mentally drained around them  i like to be alone and not bothered by them   i don t need hobbies as i m oversupplied on them already  i m a boxer  i workout  i code  i rap and sing  i m a gamer and use video games to temporarily numb my feelings  there s more but fuck that  i lost motivation to do anything for the past three months but slowly returned to it again to not feel like a complete loser  i still don t enjoy life  i never got to enjoy my teenage years  i never got to experience fun and have a adventurous life with other teenagers  i never got anything of that  hell i barely ever reached a peak of   people who i would talk to sometimes in school  though they pretended like i didn t exist outside of the classroom   the only social interaction i have in my life is e mail penpalling which i discovered back in      to make up for the emptiness in my soul  i fed off from them to keep me internally alive but not a while ago i don t feel like doing that anymore  the majority of them left and only a few besties of   year are holding on onto me  funny how internet people are better to make friends with   that s it  i m done with venting random shit on here because our reputation got ruined by cutting attention whores flexing their scars to everyone in the classroom and white girls who find it trendy to have a mental illness so there s no one to vent to  i never unbottled my feelings to anyone or showed any signs of sadness just to have unnecessary asshats off my back that i don t need   afterall  fuck all of this  i see no brightness in my future anymore  i m destined to be alone for the rest of my life and follow the same routine in my day while listening to an endless loop of the same  uicideboy  songs  i m made to be starved  i will get out of this body full of aching pain as soon as i get my possibility  see you all in the afterlife ,0
t3_dkotgw,whateversigh,so many people want to die,for the past two years i think i won t be able to recall a day when i woke up or before i went to sleep that i wouldn t think of death  this is my first post on reddit actually made an account just for this group   i think it is just sad that so many people are unhappy  myself included  i can t say   don t die  cause i want to myself   if it wasn t for my family  i guess i would be soil right now  not really sad  just find life pointless  people piss me off  but at the same time they make me happy and it is essential to hang out with them so we won t get more depressed   almost     people are active out of the           something in this group  don t know if they died or stopped thinking about death  i hope they are peaceful either way ,1

t3_dlt943,emotionalasp,how do i tell my familly that i think im depressed ,so  started to notice that my family think people with mental illness are crazy  they really hate people that are with some kind of mental illness  i think their way of thinking is just stupid and close minded  if i tell them that i am going to a psychiatrist  im going to fail their expectations and they ill probably hate me for ever  i am scared of trying that since i know that they ill start to dislike me  what could be the best way to tell them without they hating me   ps  im thinking of telling them first after starting to go to the psychiatrist  i am not okay ,0
t3_dksqou,Person_On_The_Web,after joy and sadness are gone ,there is a hole  a nothingness that just keeps getting more empty  i never thought it could get this bad but it keeps going  it just keeps getting more empty  nothingness is consuming parts of me i never even knew i had or parts that make it even possible to function    i don t understand how it keeps getting more empty  all that s left are the bones  the bones which keep me up  i want them to crumble  so i can finally die but the bones just keep getting lighter and more faint  and petrified  i think my soul is being fossilized  i m being prepared for hell   i am not a person anymore  and nothing will change  i suppose we are all in hell already though  and it s just a matter of how much time you get before the emptiness takes over  before you go insane  before you lie down and just absorb the nothingess until you become one with it   eternal nothingness  absolute hell  no light or life  nothing  nothing ,1

t3_dksx7o,throwaway5637228,so sick of being in pain,i m so tired of being in pain  both emotionally and physically   from when i was a kid up to adolescence  my mom abused me a lot  she d give me beatings at least once a week  but usually   or more times a week  i was the middle child and it seemed like i got the worst of it  my siblings didn t seem to get beatings much  if at all  she didn t leave much physical permanent damage  but the emotional scars cut very deep  i m still effected by it today  she tried making amends  but i never let her  and then she died when i was      my dad got custody of me and my brother when i got to adolescence  i was almost a teenager  and my dad was a drunk  he d come home from work every day at      o clock and go in to his room and be by himself  he neglected us most days  one day  when he was angry  he didn t go in to his room  he had a bad day at work apparently  i don t really remember all the details  i must ve made him angry because he picked me up by the neck and slammed me against a wall  choking me  my mind blocked that out for years  but my brother told me about it and my dad confessed to it in therapy after he started cleaning up his act  that was the only time he abused me  that s where my injury came from   every day i m in physical pain  ever since i was a young teen  i wake up most nights because i hurt so much  the pain starts at my neck and goes all the way down my shoulder to the middle of my arm  i don t even have much physical feeling there on the surface of where my shoulder blade is  nerve damage    but underneath hurts non stop  no medicine i ve been prescribed helps  not even vicodin  i m always in pain  i even had depersonalization for years  but i visited a chriopractor who adjusted my neck  i don t really care if people believe it  but the chiro snapped my neck and my vision instantly went from  d with no depth perception to  d  it made me cry  but i m still in pain  i ve got an mri i need to schedule  but i know even if i have surgery i ll never be       that scar will always be there   i m a young adult right now who dropped out of high school because i was all messed up on a myriad of medication and i was bullied daily  i don t even see a future for myself  i m always in physical and emotional pain  i ve got a shitty sales job where i work my ass off  and i don t even get paid part time wages for full time work because it s commission based  i make      a week if i m lucky   i m surprised i ve made it this far  i ve been suicidal since i was    and now i m     that s a third of my life  i still don t want to exist anymore  but every time i get close to killing myself i think about what my friends and family would go through if i did it  my dad cares about me a lot now  but i don t think he completely understands  i think he s mainly why i m still here  i want to try to make something of myself so i can make my dad happy  but he s so old now and i fail too much in life  i don t think he ll live long enough to see me get married or become successful  god willing those two things happen  i seriously doubt it    sorry for this long winded post    i kinda doubt anyone will read it  really ,1
t3_dkk2kd,IheartCart00ns,saddened by a reddit thread,there was a thread about a week ago     on ask where people were posting signs that someone they loved was in crisis suicidal    i realized reading this thread that i have displayed almost all of what was posted  up to and including posting the need for new homes for my pets on social media  over the past few months  then i realized that either no one in my life has noticed  or if they have they just don t care   not really looking for any kind of response  so don t feel obligated   just needed to get that off my chest somewhere ,1
t3_dlglm4,PopoRoppo,nothing is stopping me from killing myself,there is no afterlife nor god although if heaven is real which i highly doubt  there s no way i m getting an invitation  regardless of the fact that i have a complete family and tons of friends and i know it would be selfish to make them sad by my demise  ill care but only in the process prior to my death and after i die i wouldn t be around to care anymore  i d probably impact the lives of my family and friends  but if i m dead would that really matter for me  no  because a dead decaying soulless body is incapable of harboring guilt and sadness   im not inclined to kill myself right now but if life gets to the point where i failed to make ends meet and is close to becoming a homeless hag i d gladly buy a venomous snake to let it bite and kill me  or any other cool ways to die ,1

t3_dkobco,EtibEhtEtavele,i can t come up with a title because every one i type in makes me feel like an attention whore so here s my untitled vent ,i m so fucking tired  i m fucking tired of life  anytime i m not pre occupied  i m laying in bed  scrolling endlessly on my phone  or just laying there  either way  i m thinking about it   i have no fucking life anymore  i m a senior in high school  i don t have a car  i ve never had a job  and i don t even have my license because no one in my life will teach me how to drive  at least  those who have cared enough to notice that i don t have these things   having no car and no income means no one wants to hang out with me outside of school  all my friends that graduated last year still hang out with people they were friends with that are even in the grades below me  but they never text me  or acknowledge that i exist   i try not to tell my friends what i m feeling  all my friends go through stuff too  and anytime i start a message talking about it  i end up completely getting rid of it because they don t need to hear me whine about my shitty life when they ve got stuff that s probably worse happening   if i do tell my friends what i m feeling  it s all the same shit   it gets better    i m in the same spot  it s gonna be okay    just try to be happier   and all the  i love you s and shit like that   i m so fucking tired of being spoonfed the same shit  it s because they know that i m not gonna do anything  and it s because they know that the quicker they respond  the quicker i ll get off their back because i have that insecurity of knowing that they couldn t care less about anything i feel   when i made a remark about my suicidal thoughts  my friend threatened to tell my parents  i stopped talking to her about anything like that after that  i don t wanna tell my parents  they aren t gonna fucking care  it s just like everything else i say  my mother will just huff and puff about it and she ll blame it on something completely unrelated  my stepdad doesn t really give two shits   my real dad is an alcoholic  with no real life to speak of  but allegedly he also speculates that something is mentally wrong with me  i commend him for that  but we ve never really had a true relationship or bond  so it s not like anything is going to come out of that  either  i feel so genuinely uncomfortable around him  and nothing gets done if i m not emotionally involved   so  yeah  i ve got really nothing  i m too anxious to apply for jobs  my really good friend said that her dad would be able to take me driving  but i hate bothering people when i can help it  because it s just a waste of their time   it d be so much easier if i was gone  i wouldn t worry about this shit  and others wouldn t either  i wouldn t have to constantly feel like no one wants me   i ve never self harmed  but i have thought about it  i ve refrained from it because i would hate to have to explain the entirety of my mental health hellpit  that s assuming the person would understand  and not directly report it before hearing me out   if you asked me why i m posting this  i can t give you a straight answer  probably because no one knows me here   i honestly don t know why i m complaining  either  everyone else has problems  too  way worse than mine  split custody situations  no parents at all  no friends at all  those are all way worse than just being washed up at     it s not like i don t have friends  but i sure as hell can t indulge in anything  or have any kind of life   my friend guilt tripped me for it  too   your parents aren t gonna pay for you forever   yeah  because hopefully i ll be dead before there s anything else for them to pay for   my sister tries to encourage me  but it s so back handed  everyone in my family thinks it s so fucking easy  it s not  i can t work in fast food a restaurant because my anxiety is too high and i ll just get stressed and cry and then i ll get fired for being an unprofessional little bitch  i could work in retail  but all the retail stores are way too far away from my house to walk  i applied for a night shift job at the grocery store because i knew that it would be less stressful  but they denied my application  i could probably get an interview if i applied for a daytime job  but there s too many people  nothing is right for me because i m a picky piece of shit   i told my friend i wanted to call a hotline  but i also know how those things work and that s not what i want  i want someone that is in my life to either be truthful and tell me i m a piece of shit  or abandon me  it s easier that way  at least i ll know it s not a lie   please  someone  just  let me die  ,1

t3_dljl65,throaway635851,i am planning on ending it next year,i won t bore you with the long story about how i got here  long story short  verbally abusive father led up to me being really introverted and not speaking to anyone which led to a lot of bullying  life eventually got better  but my emotional state got worse and worse    the only reason why i did not do it until now was my mom  who would be devastated if she d lost me  another reason was my friends but i came to the conclusion that they do not care about me at all  how i m feeling and stuff  they just want me to live and that s it    i do not have enough money to pay for a therapy  nor any person i could talk to and no hopes for the future    the reason i chose next year is because i want to plan it very carefully  to make it look like i was kidnapped or something and to end up on the missing people list in the worst case  no one knowing that i actually died  summer      will be the perfect time  since it will be the end of my first year at uni and will plan a trip where i would go alone    why i m posting this here then you might ask  well  it is very hard to keep going even until then  and i felt sharing this with someone  anyone  will help me just for a bit ,0

t3_dkd92h,nonstop_nut_november,cry for help  or most likely pity ,foreword  i m currently fine  and not  taking action   don t contact the authorities  there s a lot of anger here  but it s my truth and if i don t share it  my brain will explode  you can t help me  but it feels better to scream behind a mask than to stay silent without one  this is my alt account  for porn  don t look at my profile                                      a message to my tormentors who don t know they are my tormentors    you think you re so fucking better than me  don t you   you hate me  you ll be happy when i die  you get hard on watching me suffer  your fucking cock gets all stiff  right  you don t care  you love this  human misery at its finest  you re not going to be laughing for long  i ll have the last word  get fucked  maybe not today  or tomorrow but someday  you will regret it  this is your fault  you pushed me  yes you did  god i m rambling  if only you could see that all i want is someone to just be my friend  my companion  anyone  humans are social creatures  do you know what happens to someone who has been deprived of that for all their life  someone not with a few friends  but someone utterly alone  you go cold inside  cynical  judgmental and negative  until it speed and rips its way through your walls  yeah  it s feeling everything bottled up spew out and spill  it s you trying to hold your tears on a bus or blaming it on allergies  it s you saying you had an accident cutting vegetables and no one questioning it  it s hell  en boucle  inside your head  it s horrible  it s usual  it s life now  it s always been there ,1

t3_dl1umy,hsacc972,does anyone else suddenly try to rationalize not killing them selves right before going to sleep ,basically whenever i wake up i ll be good for a an hour or two then depression just takes over and i lose interest in life  then whenever i lay down to go to sleep it s like my brain tries to convince or scare me that suicide isn t something i should do  i tell myself that there s a tv show that i really want to watch or a series i really want to read  after that i ll do it  on the other end it s like no what if a bad situation turns worse and whatever happens after you kill yourself is way worse than what you have it now ,1

t3_dln1ky,englishheart91,i think i m going to have to finally finish this tomorrow,i ve contemplated suicide since i was    years old  continually throughout my life i ve been horrendously depressed  it s ruined relationships and friendships  i ve pushed people that i love away from me and now i miss them all so much  the friends i have see me as someone who just makes jokes and so they don t know how desperately sad and alone i feel    my best friend who s been extremely depressed himself doesn t bother even asking how i am even though i ve spent hours with him talking through everything with him  i told him today that i was depressed and he just played it off as if it s nothing  i think if i kill myself tomorrow very few would be sad beyond a couple of days  outside of my immediate family    every morning i wake up not dead i feel so upset  and the other day when i vomited up blood because of too much drinking i was happy because i looked it up and everywhere said that it was a serious thing to happen  and i decided to leave it as i may well end up dead that way   sorry for the awful way this is written  i m in a terrible place right now,1
t3_dlbd52,CountBarbatos,my suicide note  would like some feedback,i ve written a suicide note but i ve sat on it for a few weeks  i thought i had bounced back but anti life always finds a way       i d like some critique on it  or maybe just another set of eyes on it  i m curious what people would think  i m thinking that i ll post it to facebook once i decide to jump off a parking garage  i m afraid of falling and regretting my decision on the way down but i don t have any guns and i don t want to buy any either  so i think jumping might be the best  i don t want any chances of regretting it past the point of no return    here it is     when i was a small child i had thought that the universe solely existed as a torture dungeon specifically designed to cause universal suffering  i thought that i existed solely for pain  this plagued me up until about   years ago  or maybe even    perhaps even    it s hard to say because my mind has gradually changed over time since i ve made significant lifestyle changes  something i ve had to do probably   times with much more to come    there was always this feint feeling of hope inside of me  the hope and the desire to change and seek out the life i want to live to become the best version of myself  i had a small hope that reality was actually something inherently good  i ve actually worked on a theory and formula for proving the positive existence of reality but i ve hit a pretty big snag this time around  i ve had smaller psychological breaks before but this one might be the one that does me in    perhaps depression is a self destruct mechanism for genetically dead ends  perhaps if someone is born without their emotional needs met from a young age  and perhaps if they were never taught the tools on how to form relationships with other human beings  they enter in a self destruct mode  depression  and eventually kill themselves to allow up resources and social emotional bandwidth to other better off people  or perhaps people inherently stronger than them  like a form of natural selection built right into our dna    perhaps depression and suicide isn t abnormal  perhaps the very fact people like me were born is abnormal and depression is the breakdown of our psyche until eventual course correction  suicide     to put it another way  the very fact that someone is depressed is natural and their death is assured via psychological natural selection  perhaps this process is supposed to happen to people like me  i m the error    i have struggled with depression since i can remember  probably elementary school or even preschool  i was very alone through my entire life  in preschool id hit kids because they wouldn t hang out with me  and they wouldn t hang out with me because i hit them  i can feel the echoes of this well into adulthood  maybe this is why i m still lonely  maybe this is why i am unloved  perhaps i was never to exist in the first place and suicide is just course correction for my bloodline  perhaps i am to stop here  i hope i ve explained this well enough but it might be a bit esoteric  basically  if you re suicidal  you re supposed to die  there isn t a struggle with depression because you re supposed to succumb to depression and die  trying to live is what s abnormal    every time i see a large group of friends  usually on social media living the lives that i want to live  or a happy couple enamored in romance  i m hit with intense  unending jealousy  i always wanted to be loved    i always wanted to be apart of a bigger whole so i could never be alone again  since i was in middle school i always dreamt of having a wife and kids  nothing makes me happier than thinking about a married life     something so simple as grocery shopping with my wife or playing with my kids on a beach seems paradisal to me  it s the highest pleasure that i can think of  but it isn t meant for me  that kind of happiness was never to be mine     i had fought this my entire life of    years  and maybe it s a sign from the universe telling me to bow out  this is my self destruct mechanism  it certainly seems like it  why else was i born this way  i never consented to existence anyways  it s just a prison of isolation   the ups of life are just a ploy in an effort to cause maximum despair  i m only allowed to have positive life experiences so that the next negative experience can crush me even harder than the last  it s a process of entropy to completely crush my soul    there s no shortage of young men who feel just as i do  if you re wondering why all these school shootings happen  look to this african proverb     it takes a village to raise a child  and if the village rejects the child  the child will burn down the village to feel its warmth     it s no secret  it s plain as day  young men do these things because we feel isolated and unloved  and uncared for  the isolation gives way depression and jealousy  jealously gives way to to anger  and anger to hatred   not of other people  technically   but at the structure of reality  these mass shootings are like a twisted way of showing god how awful they feel inside  it s an expression of dread more than anything    i m not like that though  i don t hate people  i love humans more than anything  that s why i hate being at home all the time  i want to be surrounded by lots of people all the time  i want to be one of them  i want to be a human too  a human that can enjoy life  can enjoy compassion and love  that can enjoy acceptance into reality  instead  i feel as if i was cast from heaven straight into hell  the love of the universe was never something i could have  it existed to torment me    my depression was a sign from god  a sign that i was never to exist in the first place    i ve written more about this in the past and maybe i didn t get everything out  but i feel so cold and alone  loveless  weak  and in pain  i m tired of the sorrow and the dread  i am tired of fighting for my life  i m tired of working meaningless jobs with shit benefits  i quit my job and am currently in community college to transfer to a university  i can t help but feel like i ve made a huge mistake by chasing my dreams  i can t get a full time job  i ve sent out apps for part time jobs with no reply  so i m broke  i have no money  i m couch surfing and have a weeks worth of oatmeal for breakfast  lunch  and dinner  and i have no healthcare because it s too expensive and isn t offered to part timers  i m tired of living like this    that s why i want to end it  i m the genetic error  i m the thing that wasn t supposed to exist  that s no ones burden but my own    so i will bow out  i feel like i should say thanks to everyone who s helped me come this far  but i don t even know if any of it was real or not  maybe this is all one grand illusion  maybe my life is just one long nightmare    i m sorry if my death causes you pain  but please understand that there isn t any other way  it s time for me to say goodbye    thank you    and that s it  i m not totally sold on my suicide just yet  but i feel like it s close  i don t think i ve included everything in here  but i think it gets the point across ,1

t3_dlc6yx,sail_to_the_m00n,crying on the bathroom floor,i m back in my long time favorite crying place feeling horribly nostalgic  i choked myself a lot like i used to but no urge to cut so there s a bright spot  i stared in the mirror and mumbled my self hate like the old days and laughed through my tears like i used to too  my urge to scream was barely contained but my fists pounded on my head so violently  i m so fucking stupid  now i m dead and dull again  the tears drip down my shirt from an expressionless face  there is nothing  i am nothing  it s all still the same  this is shit ,0
t3_dky3u5,Siumila,can you speak to my logic and not my instincts ,so  suicide prevention is usually done by triggering one s will to live  it does work  but not completely   if the consciousness still insists that the best thing to do is to die  the inner war continues  harming both mind and body  it is consciously visible to me that people who won t evolutionarily benefit from my survival would prefer an empty place instead of another body that contributes to overpopulation  the only redeeming idea i know is that more genetic variety is good and increases the chance of exceptional specimen being born    any more logical arguments so i despise my existence less  or maybe link a subreddit that ll answer this better ,1
t3_dlf43y,Maltoza,anyone else thinks that school is too much when you are depressed ,i m sitting in class now  having mental breakdown and all i can think about is suicide  i have   more years before my education is over and this idea is horrible  thinking about job isn t better because i won t go to collage and probably have shitty job if any in the future  anyone else have or had simillar thoughts  i can t take break from school in any form and every day i have to spend here is terrible  time teachers want me to spend at home learning a lot of hard yet useless things doesn t help really   i really think death is the only way to escape from this shit ,1

t3_dkx4ph,ModernFrankenstein,i feel like i m a fated to crash and burn  so i need advice,   hey  so this is going to be a long post  so consider yourself warned  i m also not from an english speaking country  but i m trying to remedy it by using word and grammarly  so you hopefully won t die  tl  dr at the bottom  throwaway account for anonymity   i m a   m danish student  living in a student s apartment  which will become relevant later  i ve officially gotten the diagnosis of asperger s from a psychiatrist  but my private doctor also recognizes me as having mild depression and severe anxiety   so  i m not going to go too far into detail about a few things about my life  as it s quite the shit show  but if asked  i ll elaborate as i m not shy about sharing  but don t want to make this unreadably long   i ll first talk about my family situation  as it becomes important later  i was born into a family of    my parents and a brother  however  when i was about    my parents broke up  and it wasn t a pretty break up  the result from that was that i and my brother would live at our mom s house  due to my father not having signed some papers as he thought they d be together forever  and so only visiting our fathers on weekends every   weeks  which wasn t exactly a good thing   for you see  my mother was an alcoholic  which until i entered my teens  i wasn t aware of due to my asperger s  i knew something was wrong though  my mother would drink wine every day  and from what my father tells me she did it while taking some medicine that essentially amplified how drunk she got  when drunk  my mother wouldn t physically abuse us  but she would emotionally bully me and my brother  she acted quite bipolar  one moment she would be all nice  the next moment you could see it like a switch behind her eyes turning on and she wouldn t yell  but she would start interrogating me and my brother about what happened when we were at our father s  which we eventually got tired of and told her off  but when we d do so  she starts crying and tell us   i m the world s worst mother i m just so terrible you have no idea how your father treated me   etc  etc  playing on our empathy making us feel terrible about ourselves for years  i recognize this as something that could come from abuse  but i honestly don t see my dad doing it  he s a very pleasant mild mannered guy that never touched us  nor did i see him drunk  even his choice in girlfriends and eventual wife was those that would be considered the dominant person in the relationship  he also always tried to make visiting him a safe haven as he knew how our mother could get   alas  back to the topic  this went on for years  well into our teens  my father eventually moved away  to the other side of the country  making us commute every second weekend for hours on bus and ferry  which didn t help our relationship much  it eventually deteriorated into us seeing him less and less   until we didn t visit him at all towards my middle teens  around the time of my diagnosis   our mother would switch out boyfriends every   years or so  some would be good influences  others not so much  one  in particular  was a great father figure  honestly better than my dad at the time as he moved away  but eventually  he had to go too  for abusing her apparently which was the same time as my diagnosis started to show itself more readily apparent  i started noticing that i wasn t quite getting the same information as everyone else  and at the same time  i also moved schools after a quite bad ending at my old one due to it  at this point  i also had a conversation with my mother about her alcohol abuse and told her i couldn t take it anymore  my brother had already left home at    years old dude to not being able to take it and was barely at home before that anyway  so  i was always all alone about it  either with or without a stepfather  personally  i chose to find my safe spot inside my room  in front of my pc  but i still heard every  argument    eventually  although not immediately  which you can t really expect  she got better  today i haven t seen her like that in years  despite my brother pointing it out every time she sips some wine  i guess i m dull like that  but oh well   this is all a kind of setup to explain  that i can t really ask my family for advice or much help  i ve over the last few years asked my mother and father about events that i remember as very  bad times  in my childhood and both have given me two very different scenarios  my fathers is reasonable has better grounds for being real than my mother  but if my mother tells me my father is a psychopath  which i very sincerely doubt too objectively  who am i to trust  i don t feel secure enough that their advice will ever help my situation and has been largely on my own  even get my diagnosis was me going to the doctor on my own  as they both said i was just making it up   anyway  this is more of a prologue to the eventual current problem i m asking for advice for   about   years ago  i got the diagnosis of asperger s  which is relatively late at the age of     i was also suffering from depression and anxiety at that point in my life  albeit not to the extent i am now  i barely met my classes in  th grade  and only because of understanding teachers i probably didn t have to take it again and got slightly below average grades  at this time  my only friends  number on one hand  and those weren t from my school and i never talked to them about serious matters  despite very much needed to talk to someone at that time   after  th grade  i tried to get into a gymnasium  of which i was denied due to absence and my guidance counselor suggesting it probably wouldn t work out  which is fair  it probably wouldn t have  i got once of those  project  like schools  which had its own bus that we took to get there  out in nowhere every day and then we d have   th grade classes  eventually  i had so much absence there as well that i couldn t continue  and my problems were only getting worse with anxiety and depression  in all honesty  i wasn t trying to get better  i felt really low at that point   here  is where i started to  regain hope  for my mother as a parent  something i sometimes doubt my brother has  she started working hard on getting me into something best described as a  daycare  for autistic people that we re unable to function in schools etc  and needed a safe place to develop to a functioning degree  i also started working to get better  personally  i started reading psychology  body language  etc  to really understand not so much what  asperger s  is  but what my individual difficulties are and learn to make up for them  i can honestly say it s the best thing that could happen  i was a real piece of shit in all honest before that and not the smartest tool in the shed either  i  however  learned a lot and have been complimented on my emotional intelligence increasingly ever since  my psychologist now even goes as far as to say i m  too smart for my own good   aka needlessly complicated things   back to topic  the  daycare  was nice but eventually wasn t enough for me as i outgrew it by actually working individually on self improvement and taking my   th grade on the side  my social worker  let s call her sw  also made that consensus and recommended and it oriented thing for people with an autism related diagnosis  which was nice  but not really where my passion lied  i still had problems at this point heavily with anxiety  but somehow made it to moving out into a student s apartment  i m about     bordering on    at this point  moving out was amazing  he changed everything  i developed faster than i had ever thought possible  i came out of depression mostly too   but as the it thing didn t work out  sw saw this as an opportunity for a new psychology autism specific mentor thing  not quite sure what to call it in english  but it helped me a lot  previously i d had a personal vendetta against psychologists  i took a bit of a  good will hunting  narcissism approach to it and didn t want them to pick my brain apart  but eventually agreed to it  which was amazing for me as it provided a helpful foundation for the newly gained growth spurt of moving out  my anxiety started to decrease  i met up more often to the meetings and eventually finished some school programs from online schooling   now to more recent events  i felt i was on top of the world  figuratively and comparatively speaking ofc  i was still a far cry from  normal   but i was getting there  so i eventually started doing interning  which in denmark is also used for development for  people like me  to work on their anxiety and start meeting up more  ofc it was all unpaid  but still great for my quality of life  i also got accepted into the gymnasium i applied to outta  th grade  but for a class specifically for people with autism related problems   then everything started going down the drain  i was in my last   weeks of interning  when i suddenly one day at work  had the shits  like the real bad anxiety kind and from bad food  but i was deadly afraid of using toilets outside my house  so  i eventually went to my superior told him i didn t feel well and excused myself to go home  however  the bus had just left   minutes earlier  but it wasn t a long walk home  or so i thought  my stomach started getting increasingly worse and i was sweating bullets while my anxiety went      thinking everyone  knew  i was about to shit myself  about    th the way home  i had to walk into a forest and do the deed there  i m not going to go into much more detail  after that i went home without incident  but i think something inside my psyche broke on that day  every day after  i d have increasing difficulty getting to work  taking days off due to my anxiety basically going back to day   again  none of the exercises worked that i had previously done and when i d get there  i d usually go home early due to the fear of public bathrooms  etc  i just felt like i had to go to the toilet all the time  albeit not extremely so  but it was incredibly taxing on me   eventually  however  i had to start school  the introduction day went fine  i went to the toilet twice and everything went relatively well  the next day  however  usually  as the special class  we don t have any classes with  the normals  and would only have   type of class with them  for me  that was art class  and as luck would have it  which the teachers also later apologized and promised would never happen again  we had it the very first class  st day  fuck me  right  well    minutes into the class  i tell the teacher i got to go the toilet real quick   we kind of just started the lecture  but okay   and so  i went  did the deed and came back  introductions have started  they re really slow though  nice people all around     minutes later  omfgawdsa i must go right now to the toilet  but i just went  would be rude to leave again  so  i took my bag and left  couldn t deal with it  went to my mentor s office and found she only got to school   hours from there  so  i couldn t explain myself to anyone really  i packed my stuff and went home  i ofc  i did the only responsible thing and messaged both my mentor and teacher about the  why  and such  but my bad stomach  as i would call it  fed on my despair and grew incredibly from this experience  i didn t meet in the next   days   on monday  the next week  i had sought out a doctor s appointment  one with my psychology mentor  which was still ongoing  and a meeting with my school mentor  they re separate   and i also had fresh courage of a weekend well rested  well  i wish i could tell you all that i was brave in the face of adversity  but i ve never felt so much anxiety and fear as i had   minutes into sitting on that bus  i felt my lower half was about to explode from built up tacos or something  and my fear was playing the knowledge that i was     minutes away from a toilet and would deed my pants before that  so  i gave in  i stepped off the bus the next stop and went home  wrote more messages to the teachers etc   as great as free health care is  it s  however  a shit show waiting line  had the appointment a month later  and they guard their emergency times with the might of thanos himself  so someone so insecure as i didn t stand a chance  because being unable to attend school isn t an emergency  at least not until a week later where i got an emergency time for the doctor due to not having met at school   after meeting my doctor and taking some tests  it was concluded  as everyone told me  it was psychosomatic  oh well  we in the for the long haul then  i got new medication to deal with some of the anxiety and some fiber pills to deal with the stomach  wish it worked though  even after upping the dose it didn t do enough  i  as the ever pragmatic person i was  dealt with it and thought several tens of ways to deal with it and started implementing it in several ways  eventually  i started meeting up in some classes   it s important to know now  that apparently  i was never meant to take this education over   years  i was meant to take it over    effectually halving the number of classes the first two years  but there had been an administrative mistake and i was put on the   years  so  they put me over on the right one  and i didn t have nearly as many classes and chose the days i could muster my courage up for the more important days  i was progressing too  at a decent speed  but then they started pressuring me about the fact that i hadn t tried my art class since the first day  and i wasn t ready  but sure i ll try because i m a pushover  and it went bad again and didn t meet up for a week  that was   weeks ago   right now  i feel like i just can t get there fast enough you know  and would eventually be kicked out  i m in dire need of advice  there s nobody i can really talk to about it besides my psychology mentor  who i m at the point where the offer is running out and the government isn t very happy for prolonging that kind of thing as soon as you re considering within a proper education   i ve had several thoughts  maybe ask to go to a psychiatrist for evaluation of proper medicine  as the ones i get now are prescribed by a general doctor  maybe just accepting i won t be able to this year and drop out  but then i wouldn t be able to live in my apartment as it s only for students  and you can only live half a year before they throw you out without ongoing education  i d first be able to join an education after next summer   i m so very very lost right now  i just don t know what to do  as the title says  i feel i m going to crash and burn at this point  i also feel like this happens every time i make enough progress  i crash and burn  i ve lately also started idealization  which to me  until now  has seemed like a selfish action despite how low i got  but now  i feel like i just won t ever make it out of this hole  no matter how fast i crawl   tl  dr   after starting education in a special autism class  i developed anxious stomach issues and have become barely able to attend classes and unsure what to do  got no one else to really ask ,1
t3_dledrv,rotasaki,adrenaline  overdose ,i m new to reddit and this is my first post  my depression has been getting worse over the years and it s getting difficult to find outlets  suicide is constantly on my mind  even during moments where i feel calm and somewhat happy  i have a   year old daughter and she s beginning to notice that i m  sad or tired   in reality i m really depressed and have no way of dealing with it except adrenaline  however  this isn t the best outlet for me for   reasons         the type of adrenaline that helps my depression is dangerous and expensive  it puts me at the knife edge of harm and also puts others in harm s way       it makes me  overdose   it puts me into a deep sleep  makes me slack and procrastinate  kills my appetite  and gives me withdrawl symptoms    i feel like it isn t healthy but i have no other escape ,0
t3_dl84j3,ineedtostopcaring,i wouldn t wish having a mental problem on anybody,it s hell  every day is me struggling and trying to do my best  and i always wind up disappointed  people always say that the only thing you have control over in life is yourself  but for me that s not even the case  i don t have control over my actions  there are thousands of points in my life where i ve screwed things up because i genuinely couldn t get myself to do what was needed   i will never get better  my choice in life is either to suffer and experience an ever worsening life or to just clock out early  as the years go by the second option just seems more and more appealing   i can t do this anymore  every day is just a reminder that i m not normal and that i ll never be normal ,1
t3_dl8m8x,420throawayz,my deadline is approaching ,a few months ago i posted something on here about having a suicide date set  it s still there  nothing good as happened that has made me change my mind about it  i m not gonna lie and say that i m not scared  i am terrified of it  but    i m way more scared of prolonging my suffering than i am of ceasing to exist  it s messed up  i know   in less than two months i lost people that i talked with for years online  some i blocked them because they were toxic and i decided to care for myself  you know    if i m gonna kill myself later on this year might as well care for me in this little time that i have  people have always ignored me or treated me like i m lower than them and i used to have a lot of anger inside of me but not anymore  i m at peace  i don t hate anyone anymore  only myself and that s already a lot of hatred inside my heart   i m not religious but i pray that i don t feel a thing once i do it  not hurting for my last moments would be good  anyway  in two months a lot can happen but i don t know if it s best to have hope or to just let it go sooner than the set date ,1
t3_dl6i7b,TanakaBambooWarrior,i completely wasted this decade,     is looming  this is the first time that i m aware of the passage of time encapsulated into decade format   i was born in       i was too young to remember          was all about the millennium and     didn t seem distinct as the dates in first part of a century are kind of formatted differently     school was the last thing i did that advanced my life forward and that ended before       it s shocking and suffocating to realize that for an entire decade my life hasn t made any progress  i m literally in the same situation as i was in      except older and even more unhappy ,0

t3_dkx1x5,tessathetreefrog,i feel like i have nowhere left to turn,i ve never posted here and never thought i d seriously consider suicide again  i felt like i was just out of the woods with depression and anxiety and my life is completely ruined now  i m isolated and don t have anyone to talk to seriously about what i m going through  i feel like they re disgusting by a teenager being pregnant and it makes me feel so worthless  i feel guilty for thinking about killing myself just because my baby deserves a chance at life but then i remember it doesn t really matter anyways  i won t feel guilt or shame  no embarrassment or feeling hopeless and lost ,1
t3_dlc3js,fakepebong,i keep thinking about how it would be better if i died or just didn t exist anymore,since i started having depression  when i feel extremely sad and lonely  i think about how good it would be to be dead or just vanish and not exist anymore  because i know that the things that makes me unhappy and sad won t change and there is nothing i can do  on the other hand  i will never be able to kill myself  i can t even imagine the pain i would feel and how desperate i would be  not to mention the fact that it would be something terrible for my family and might destroy their life aswell  but i don t know what to do anymore  i want things to get better and i try it  but nothing works  any help  advice or just kind words are welcome  sorry if it was long ,0

t3_dloqx4,altaway01,i think i m too far gone,when you slip through the cracks far enough  there s no coming back  i have all this mental life that i can t share with anyone  everytime i do  i either lose that person or regret it  so i end up just faking everything  and feel completely alone around people  so i usually just stay home by myself  life is awful  i m not built for it  i suffer constantly  come here to talk but don t send anything because i fear what people will say back  i fear that i really am alone  that i ll never figure things out  i fear that i ll find the answers that i somehow feel to be true  that i m alone  and that i should kill myself  that there is no coming back and i am just postponing death  i m already not living  i m just existing  i don t know if there is anything anyone can say which could help  i ve been to therapy  it s helpful   for about    seconds  then i go back to my life and the bandaid from therapy no longer works  don t really know my intention with posting this  every week i tell myself that i m going to kill myself but never do  i m too much of a coward  i need to be a whole hell of a lot stronger to live this life  there s this gap that i have to jump  from the place where i am now  which is merely existing  to where life can be lived  it s similar to fish that have to swim up a waterfall to get to a safe place to live  that gap keeps getting wider as the years go on  i think it s been impassable for some time now  i don t know  suffering sucks,0

t3_dko7fj,12yroldNibba,i just drank the strongest bleach i could find,i am ready to die  i have already drunk   gulps of bleach  the strongest one i found at the store  and all i felt was nausea and burning in my neck    i dont feel like im fainting  i dont feel like im about to die    but i want to die    i was shaking so much that i cant even explain it    i have a lot of reasons to end my life  and some are more reasonable than others  but they all hurt me as much    i have tried killing myself   times today  i dont usually get out of the house  but i did today  and i jumped in front of a car on my way home    the driver literally flipped me off and called me a stupid depressed teen  then left    when i came home i took a lot of pills  i overdosed on a lot of them    then  recently  i drank some bleach  and nope  it doesnt work either    so im gonna go to sleep soon since for me its evening  but if i do happen to wake up  i will just try dehydration since  you know  you cant live for long without water  and im prolly not gonna regret it at all  since i wont feel anything    so yeah  this might or might not be the last thing i ever typed in my entire life  but anyways  thank you for reading this and have a nice day   ,1

t3_dlv4ic,ll2525,why can t i prioritize my mental health ,it s been about   years since i first realized i needed help because i was having suicidal thoughts so often that it was affecting my everyday life  since then i have just become more aware that i have a problem but i have not taken the necessary steps to actually getting better  i spent some time travelling  moved to a couple of different places where i could live and work close to nature thinking that maybe i need to be spend more time outdoors  i ve gone on   month  long hiking trips  i ve done that things i thought would help since i don t want to take pills  i m pretty adamant about not taking pills  i really believe there is a more holistic approach to improving my mental health  the only time i feel better is when i m romantically involved with someone or am in love  and i don t think that being with someone solves my problems but the positive feelings i experience during my time with my partner are so powerful that my negative feelings are outweighed  but then when they are not around i try and find constant distractions  i ll call all my friends and talk on the phone  for hours or i ll go on tinder and chat with other men  i am not in a monogamous relationship so i am not hurting anyone by being active on tinder   my point is that i am trying to fill any time alone i have with other people  i guess i just hate being alone with myself  but i know that i need to love myself in order to get better but i just don t want to do that work  i know i need to see a professional who can help me work through my negative thoughts and change the way i think about myself  but i just don t want to spend the money on that  and i definitely can afford to  i m not living paycheck to paycheck so i have extra money to spend on a therapist but i just don t want to  i don t know why i don t want to get better  i know i need to but i can t figure out why i m resisting it so much ,1

t3_dk8z52,lifesucc,i just can t help the feeling ,i ve had a hard time my whole life  ive felt outcast my whole life  i m growing up now  trying to become my own man  but nothing has changed  i m    years old now and i still have the thought in the back of my mind  i m alone  sad  and anxiety ridden    i would like to seek professional help  but i can barely afford rent and food  i never had a father figure growing up  and my mom spent most of my childhood high and not around  emotionally  so i can t really turn to them for help  no grandparents  they committed suicide  i ve felt abandoned my whole life    there have been good moments  i will admit that  i ve been fortunate enough to have recently made friends with people who i feel truly care about me  they were the first people with whom i had dropped my guard around  let them in and became close with  i can be myself around them    especially her  i m sorry  ashli   i don t know what s wrong with me really  i can t cope with my problems  so i just self harm or get high on whatever i can  it s the only thing that makes me feel alive  i don t know what to do  i don t see it ever being any different than this  and it just seems to make sense that this is the way it goes    life isn t happy  i ve never known true happiness  i think  not having a dad was one thing  and i think i could have been alright with just that  but it wasn t just that  between the getting beaten with paddles and belts and getting kicked around  between all the insults and neglect  came a realization that this was hell  that was the first time i took an attempt at my life  and it wouldn t be the last   i am certainly not a good human being  i cheat  steal  lie  and manipulate  i am selfish  i have found myself doing to the only people who have shown me kindness what i felt in my childhood  i didnt mean to  i didnt want to  i hate that i did it   but i guess everyone comes around full circle eventually  i just wish i could have been someone else  fuck me  fuck it all   i dont know if i can live in this cold and relatively uncaring world ,1

t3_dlvfrd,nikkasonlylove,i need to help my mum,tl dr  i need advice on helping my mum as she struggles with depression  my mum has suffered from depression for a long time due to abuse she received as a child  when i was younger i remember her sitting in her room for weeks at a time just staring at the wall with this glassy look in her eyes  that woman is not my mother    my mum when she is not suffering from depression is a kind  hardworking and beautiful woman  she is my best friend and we do a lot of stuff together   at the beginning of this year my parents separated after over    years of marriage  my mum s depression basically disappeared after my dad moved out but a few days ago it came back  and now without my dad to take out her sadness on she has turned to me   i assume she is stressed about our current financial situation  as the money she earns per week is pretty much the same amount the mortgage on our house costs per week  my dad gives me some pocket money and pays for my school fees but she constantly is looking for apartments to rent out of fear that my dad will sell the house  he is a carpenter and he built it  and its in a really good area  even though my dad said he wanted me to graduate while living in the house    i grew up helping my mum when she was sad but nothing ever made her happy until my dad moved out  every time she s gotten angry with me over the last few months  even over very small things  she starts screaming and threatening to kick me out    i am a good student and i worked really hard to get into the school that i go to today  all of my friends are really studious and i don t hang out with  the wrong people   i ve never sneaked out  gotten in trouble with the law or done drugs  im a captain at my school and one of the highest achieving students in two high level subjects  yet  if i do one thing wrong like not eating breakfast one morning or watch youtube when i get ready for school  she goes off at me and won t talk to me for the whole day   now that my dad is gone i have nobody to hide behind or call for help if i need it  she has already tried to kill herself before and she said i was the only thing keeping her alive  so if she hates me  there won t be anything keeping her alive and im scared  i love my mum and so do all her friends and all the kids she works with at her job  i don t know what to do  the situation right now is not bad at all  but i know how bad it can get and i just need advice on how to help her get through her tough times together ,0
t3_dl8ary,UselessShrimp,i m tired of being sad all the time,let me put it this way  i ve been depressed for a very  very long time  usually i can still function  you know  go to school and work and such  but recently my coworker started showing interest in me  i m very low tier  by the way   of course  i m immediately given a little joy to counteract my numb feeling    this is not what i ever wanted    she gets my number  starts texting me  things up to this point were very good  i was actually kind of happy for once in a very long time  but then she drops a very sudden and very harsh bombshell   we shouldn t be together anymore     seeing those words immediately brought back my numb feeling  only this time it was worse  that happiness i was getting toyed around with is now something that i not just live without  but is something that i did not want to give up    you might think this has everything to do with the girl  but it doesnt  it s really just me realizing how painful being sad  being happy for a few days  and going back to being sad is  i was just fine with my numb feeling  i could coast through and not give a fuck  but after feeling just a small amount of happiness  something i am so deprived of  i cant go back to being unhappy  it pains me to my core  so  i m now i guess i m just going to wallow in pain for the next year until i m numb to everything again  i give up  i m tired of trying anymore  it never helps  it never gets better  anything that makes you happy is surely short lived  and i just cant take it anymore  it just hurts ,1
t3_dk75al,TheRealBarnowl,i m a failure,this is the first time i m talking about this  i m a disaster  a complete disappointment  it all starts in april of this year  after nearly   years of abuse by my mother  i run away to my father  she was gothel from tangled in person  she always tries to look you hand beautiful  she let my hair grow painfully long  she was physically and mentally abusive  manipulative  things so disgusting  i get sick from them   but i forgave her  i just want to move on  i want to live without her  i don t blame her  i just don t want to deal with her anymore   but everyone drags me to her  saying she is my mom  what person i am if i don t want to talk to her    i started being toxic  i always put myself first  i m rude and cringe  selfish and careless  i distanced myself from friends  i actually enjoy being alone  i just need time to enjoy  but it s simply not possible   those responsibilities and desicions i have to make  even my heart  the one i m your chest  complains about the stress  i started having high blood pressure  the school  making me things do  i can t stand and giving me huge projects   even if theres absolute no reason   i just don t do  if i say something about it  it s just funny or they just forget it    for months already i m feeling like  a beautiful day goes to its end  no one says a word but you just feel it  or you re so tired  lying in bed  and you know  if you close your eyes only for a moment  you are going to fall asleep  it sounds stupid  i know    i actually can t do it anymore    day till the holidays end  i just stopped drinking   days ago  i just want to shut down  fall asleep and never wake up  i don t want to hurt loved ones  or never achieve my dreams  but i guess this system isn t for someone like me  i won t be used to routine  or finally sort my mess or ever be capable of of doing anything someone expects from me  i m useless  i will write after this my suicide note  i kinda feel dizzy and don t want to move anymore  i guess i ll have to make my biggest decision i ve ever made   if i don t do anything there will be no way back    that s actually shit i wrote  i probably will delete it ,1

t3_dl6yo9,ihatemyself182,alternatives to medication for treating severe depression ,i know studies have shown that for mild to moderate depression  exercise and psychotherapy can be good alternatives to taking medication  and might work just as well  well  my depression is severe  and i m wondering if there are non medication alternatives that would help me too  i can t get out of bed and i want to kill myself  i am currently trying to finish college  but can t bring myself to get out of bed to go to class  and can t focus enough to do homework  if i do graduate  i don t think i would be able to hold down a job in my current state  also my girlfriend broke up with me because she can t watch me slowly kill myself anymore    anyway  i don t want to take meds  i ve tried them before for many years  and went off just   months ago  which triggered the relapse into my current depressive episode  they helped a little but not enough to justify poisoning my body  i m terrified of long lasting side effects and  tmi  but they make my genitals completely numb which is absolutely horrible  being on them causes me so much anxiety it just isn t worth it   so what can i do  everyone in my life is begging me to take meds and i d rather kill myself honestly  doctors all tell me my depression is so severe meds are needed  i don t want to accept that  so what can i do  please i need options  i would do anything not to have to take medication and am willing to try anything ,0
t3_dltgws,km454,how do you know when it s time to find a new therapist ,i ve struggled with my mental health for most of my life  and i have been to see tons of therapists and psychiatrists  unsuccessfully  in the last ten years  about three years ago  i suffered a serious breakdown and managed to find my current therapist  she and i have connected  and since i began seeing her i have made enormous strides  she connected me to my psychiatrist  and for the first time in years i felt like i might be able to someday handle this whole  living with depression  thing   two months ago  my therapist was diagnosed with a serious illness  i went from meeting with her every week  and emailing calling her between appointments to connect if necessary  to meeting with her once every two weeks with a high chance of last minute cancellations and minimal contact opportunities between appointments    i feel like i m taking a nosedive at the moment  i lack all motivation  i feel constantly irritable and disconnected  and i m starting to self isolate and self sabotage again  i feel like i m approaching my lowest point in years at the moment  the practice i see both her and my psychiatrist through has offered to transition me to someone else s caseload  but i am terrified  what if i can t connect with another person  what if i lose the three years of progress i have made in the time it takes me to adjust to the new person  it took over a year for me to feel comfortable with the person i am currently seeing  what if i can t handle the transition   has anyone else dealt with anything similar  i don t know how i can make the right decision here  on one hand  i leave the person i trust and risk losing the progress i ve made  on the other hand  i can stay with her and hope the inconsistency doesn t lead to a downward spiral   honestly  i d typically go to my therapist with this sort of decision for guidance and support through it  but i just don t know how or when to bring it up to her  i feel so alone and scared in making this decision at the moment ,0

t3_dkv3i7,safioahe,i hate feeling this way   repost from r teenagersuicidewatch ,i hate feeling this way  everything in life sucks doesn t it   nobody loves me  right   why does nobody care about me   is there any purpose to life   i m just the fat kid in the back of the class aren t i   i should just disappear for a little bit shouldn t i   why do i feel like the answers have been in front of me the whole time   i don t even feel bad enough to feel like i m insulting myself   no one would notice if i just left would they   i m not special or anything am i   why am i the only on drowning in this storm   i want to end this nightmare   i want to stop suffering from this storm    i want to not feel useless   i want to not feel ashamed of the way i look    i want to not be judged by anyone for anything   i don t want to feel like everyone s punching bag   i want to be able to stand up for myself     i want to die,1
t3_dkq4pi,throwaway_necromancy,the system is horribly cruel ,we keep people alive because we feel some moral obligation  no matter how much suffering we bring them    now  i m not saying that some suicides are not impulsive  or that no situation can improve    everyone should be given the chance to live and rebuild their life    but people won t get better if they don t get provided with proper help    the system puts people in a position where they neither are allowed to die  or to heal    if you ask for help  it s either gonna take months for mediocre support  or worse  you get rejected    in places where healthcare isn t  free   most people can t even  afford  to get help    so what happens  people resort to dying    but that isn t allowed either  so they put you on suicide watch    good job  you took not  only  somebody s hope for help  but also the one escape they had    why  because we feel as if everyone should live to      years of age  and then die of natural complications    and they do not consider the human behind the number    all we do is keep people alive  no matter the cost    for some  that might be    years of  i wish i ended it yesterday     for some  that might be    years of avoidable suffering ,1
t3_dla5q4,shutupmyhead,does depression hurt your intelligence ,i don t know if i ve ever been smart  i was always a good student  but i always just memorized things in order to pass tests and then tossed aside all the information forever  i never cared about learning  but now it s really starting to hurt me   i feel maybe my depression is causing me to be unable to learn things  nothing ever sticks in my head  i could not tell you who the countries were fighting in wwii yet i ve read it a dozen times  i don t know basic american history  i m american   i can t do simple math in my head  etc  every time i try to hold an intelligent conversation with other people  they end up correcting me on literally everything i say  and then i just stay quiet or leave  i get really angry when people correct me too   maybe i m just not a smart person in general  but that depresses me because my dad is pretty smart and he always tried to teach me cool stuff about science and history  and i feel horrible that none of it sticks in my brain   i feel i got broken up with because i wasn t smart enough  he was always correcting me  then it just always caused fights  i kept apologizing for not being smart but i couldn t help it   this is an endless cycle and i wish i was smarter  i wish i could have a full thought  any thoughts i have are very scattered and i can never finish a thought  i don t have adhd or any learning disability that i know of  but i m starting to question it   i hope my post makes sense  i feel like my thoughts are always scattered all over the place and confusing  does depression affect one s intelligence or ability to learn ,0

t3_dk7t0e,throwaway88273889263,f   i m scared and not safe  my best friend f   hurt me badly emotionally last night and my roommate kinda nonconsensual gf   f attacked me  tw  childhood rape  suicide  emotional abuse,to start  i m on mobile so forgive typos and wrong words  my autocorrect does weird things to what i write sometimes  i m laying in bed crying right now with the door locked  i m scared and i have no one in my life to vent to or to get this out of me to who i actually know at this point but i need it out there in case something goes horribly wrong through the rest of the weekend     i invited friends over to hang out last night  after dinner the one left leaving me home with my best friend q    f and my roommate s   f   i took s into my home maybe a year and a half ago now  she had been kicked out her lease for being lgbt and was at high suicide risk  well i greatly care about her and she s been pretty infatuated with me causing her to chase me pretty hard for wanting a relationship  though o never consented to a full blown romantic relationship we ended up sleeping together and becoming fwb but the boundaries i set have been continually violated and whatever is between us is now unrecognisable to me as something i ve never consented to and the lines between being a dearly loved friend fwb dominate to my submissive role in bed girlfriends has become so blurred and tangled   i ve been working in therapy lately to try and figure out how to untangle myself from s but still keep her as a loved friend and essentially family because i don t have family of my own any more besides these two women  q and s    i had been a victim of chronic childhood rape and have been nocontact with my biological family for a year now due to feeling unsafe particularly as my parents still don t know about the rape stuff aside from that i was raped as a kid and that the preparator having been my brother  i get panic attacks suicidal af during family events where he may show up  add in also being rejected by parents because of being lgbt and we ve got a party down here in the south   so now q and s are extremely drunk and im inebriated myself on pot which gets me pretty horny so i m in my own little world playing on my phone while they watch youtube on the tv        an aside is my cat knows i m not well and is currently crying at the door but i m afraid to move to let her in     i go to the bathroom and q shouts something at me which nuked my feelings as it echoed my abuse so now any feelings of sexiness have done a     into feelings of extreme disgust and self hate     i text s who has been poking me all night worried about the serious faces i ve been making as i played on my phone   s sends me a sexy picture  me  j   red  i need space for a bit  s okay sorry love  me i m going to bed  i need to be alone  s i m sorry j  s i m going to come in at some point to take my meds but i ll leave you alone  if that s what you need   me door is locked please no one bother me  what are your meds i ll set them out  i need isolation right now  s j what s wrong i m worried  me come take them now just leave me be in the closet  me i just need to calm down and be alone and untouched  me no communication  just need silence in my head  me i m safe  this is where i move to the closet in the dark  naked as i was laying down in bed  i forgot to unlock the door though so i hear a bang as she drunkenly bypasses the door lock and some crashing sounds from the bedroom so now i m getting scared as well   me please don t be angry  me i need space i m having a panic attack  i hear her leave the room again but quickly hear more crashing from another room  and then her back in the bedroom approaching the closet door  i m curled up in the dark naked and trying to calm down and figure out wtf why everything is suddenly so horribly wrong when she turns on the closet light and throws the door open  i screamed afraid   she crashes past me and is jumping up and down trying to grab something from the shelf  me crying  scared and cowering beneath her as stuff is crashing down around me from above  she pulls down the primary suicide method i have  that i ve had complete in the house since my birthday last year  two bottles of chemicals that when mixed produces a deadly non painful gas   s and i have a suicide pact after having made several attempts on our own independent of one another previously and i figured a pact would lend strength to whichever of us is the weaker one at the time so that we could make it another day because the other person wouldn t be ready to call it quits yet   at this point i m now crying begging her  red  over and over again which in the kink community means extreme emergency hard stop  i m sobbing uncontrollably as she s screaming at me through her own tears  telling me  we just need to mix the chemicals and we ll be good  what are you waiting for  just fucking do it  i ve  s  been holding back ideation all day and have been crying nonstop to my therapist today  she had an appointment earlier that day  that i just can t do this anymore and i don t know how q and i pissed you off but i m sorry and i fucking needed you tonight and you got pissed and fucking went to isolate yourself    i m still sobbing curled up tightly shivering in fear and crying red over and over again  i start to disassociate though and feel my emotions floating away leaving me feeling hollow  a feeling i m so used to from surviving childhood  so now with less emotions i try to diffuse the situation  telling her i still can t be touched right now but that i hear her and i m sorry and i just needed space and i m scared   she apparently hadn t seen all the texts and only got to the point where i told her to come get them  so over the next hour i m trying to calm her down without moving from being curled up as small as i can  i get her to leave the closet without touching me and i take a minute scrambling to get dressed from within the closet as i feel vulnerable  scared and disgusted by my body  i hear her hitting herself in the bedroom at least twice   i join her in the bedroom again not looking at her and no touching as i sit on the other side of my bed from her  i beg her and try to console her own pain with my words  she calms down and starts climbing into my bed so im forced to speak up that  i m sorry  but i still need to be alone tonight  i can t be touched right now    i ll give you the bed if you want it and i ll be elsewhere but i need space tonight   she starts crying some again so i ask her to drink a  reasonable  amount of zquil and that she ll be better when she s not drunk any more  she again starts to calm down a little bit it starts again as i stand and start moving towards the door  i have to calm her by touch  sacrificing another piece of myself and what i need in the moment for someone else and still all i can manage is putting my hand on her forehead   i leave the bedroom  shaking from adrenaline and fear but with most of my own pain now suppressed and more of a doll throbbing as i m well into disassociation  q is gone    i check my phone to find she s sent an angry text about being left alone at some point during all of this and on google maps it now shows her back at home that she must ve gotten an uber   so i m wired from having had red bull cocktails earlier and all the adrenaline and fear  i find and message a domestic abuse hotline which helped a lot in the moment last night though was still scared as s is just asleep still in the other room  finally i m alright enough to try to sleep though i keep jerking wide eyed awake at every bump in the house from my nest i ve made on the floor of the office  so i go to her own bed because she sure isn t using it    i lock the door and climb in bed and for the past   hours ive managed sleep  i ve been stuck in nightmare land  ironically it s one i had the night before as well that ended up coming true in the events of the day  i woke up the other night before screaming and crying also     the dream being that my father is chasing me around my parents house trying to get me  me begging that i just need space  to please let me be alone for just a minute  well what was an unrefined nightmare yesterday night  tonight was refined as fucking hell and vivid as he d try to grab me and touch me as he got near and me screaming crying and running from place to place in the house but never able to get away     so now i m laying here on a giant stuffed animal caterpillar  my face hurts from crying nonstop  s texted me this message earlier in the morning   s i know you don t want to hear from me right now  i m sorry about everything  i didn t see most of these texts last night  when i read isolation i was triggered and spiraled  i had been trying to repress my ideations since therapy  i hate myself for invading your space when you needed to be alone  i just wanted to die  still do honestly  i was never angry at you i just had nothing to hold onto   i m scared to make any sound in case i wake her up  i ve texted q now who is hurt herself because i ignored her    to her i ve said   me i can t talk to anyone right now but i need you to know that last night s series of events have greatly hurt me badly  i m in a lot of pain  scared and alone  me i ve managed maybe   hours of sleep of a constant nightmare and have been crying nonstop  so now i lay here  i don t know what to do  i don t know how to take care of myself in this moment when i m scared of s  angry and hurt by q and disgusted by myself and in so much pain that ideation is definitely happening  i m not safe     tldr    i m scared  suicidal and alone  i m scared to say the wrong thing to my friend who i ve found myself in a relationship i ve never consented to  i m afraid that she ll hurt herself and though i ve put so much effort into being a survivor  i still carry a death wish and could care less about what happens to myself   honestly i intended this to be posted on  relationships because i ve had so many cries for help overlooked here before in  sw and it hurts    a lot  especially as i ve a need to be seen and i just want someone to understand how fucking monumentally hard i ve been trying    but because i was raped i don t belong in  relationships      i m honestly crying again and more suicidal now than before writing all this useless fucking meaningless garbage  i really should just give in,1

t3_dldvmf,rosernarie,they say not to rely on other people for happiness but it seems unrealistic to expect someone to feel better when they re surrounded by their own dark thoughts ,i truly believe i would feel more stable if i were surrounded by people with similar interests as me  i would feel less alone  i d be more occupied   but it s so fucking hard to do anything  everything makes me feel uneasy ,0

t3_dlnds6,Skullmechanics8, they don t invite you because you never say yes you don t initiate anything you act like you don t want to hang out with them ,it s fucking bullshit   nobody has ever invited me to a social event since fucking grade    not to mention that all of my  friends  only arrived in grade      how am i the one saying no if i was never asked in the first place   and i do try to make plans every so often  just rarely  almost as if i ve been conditioned to assume that they ll say no because they always fucking have   i m always wrong  even if i do what other people do that worked  it doesn t work for me  i can follow the advice of my therapist or try to do it myself  but either way i still get rejected  every  single  time   empirically  it s a problem with me  but i can t do anything to disprove this for years ,0
t3_dlqr21,r_ii,i m so tired of people,even if i ve been doing fine for most of the day  someone can say one thing and it ll send me in a downward spiral  i just wanna lock myself in my room and shut out everyone  even if it s not something someone directly says  even just ignoring my thought or changing the subject on something i brought and changing the subject to something that applies to the other person just makes me so upset  i feel so unheard  so unimportant  it s hard to believe people care when they always just go and bash something i enjoy or disregard the things i say and make me feel invisible or useless  i m so sick of people  am i just overly irritable or sensitive  i don t know ,0
t3_dlo7j5,ErnstWMach,a beautiful letter from son to father,a friend just forwarded this to me  his dad encouraged him to have this email posted  and i think it is quite something   dear dad    there are many reasons that i shouldn t put this in writing  but i think the benefits far outweigh them    you reminded me when we spoke today of what it felt like to be in a quote unquote rut  what i feel compelled to tell you  is that that term does not do the experience justice  not by a light year    there were many times that i felt essentially certain that    because i was so miserable  that i was going to die naturally in the near future  i could not possibly continue to suffer this way and survive  therefore i did not have to bother with killing myself     someone who is in a quote unquote rut  like i was  needs more than anything to be told over and over by people that care that they are loved  that they have worth  that they are worth something to the world  and that they are not alone no matter how much they may feel so     i pass along this advice  or rather illustration  such that if you know anybody who knows someone who feels that way  or ever encounter it again in any person anywhere    that you will viscerally know that   that   is what they need more than anything  and being made to feel the opposite by anyone is reinforcing and only deepens the so called rut     i am sorry that on a day that was so wonderful with you that i find myself writing such a macabre and dark sounding email  but the truth is that this email is a beautiful and helpful and illuminating thing  and i know that you can see that  i also am certain that you will understand what it takes to write an email like this  and how much love    trust   and respect it displays  in neon    to the recipient     if you would please do me the favor of keeping in confidence that you heard these truths from me personally  i would be greatly appreciative  the choice of course is yours     i love you  and i love that i truly can feel love again  in this world     with the utmost sincerity     you re eternally grateful son ,1

t3_dlmcig,maydaydreamking,depression  amp  obsession,i just don t want to fucking live bro nothing i do is right my heart is too pure for this world i hurt everyone but it s her over everyone she s the only one i care for id cut everyone off for her but she s my happiness and if i lose her i am nothing and don t have anything i know you re not supposed to rely on someone else but i do because she relieves my depression and with her it s non existent but she gets upset over little things and when i m wrong i ll admit it but that doesn t seem to matter  she s so quick to see the negatives and nearly gives up every time things aren t going right but i fight and fight to keep us together because i know we are the only real ones out here and we love each other so much that little things we do hurt each other  im not living for anyone but her anymore or my friends   this is a text i sent to a friend trying to  vent  idk wether it helps me feel better or not but this girl literally cures my depression but when we aren t good it s quite the opposite  i just got diagnosed with depression a few weeks ago and it all makes sense why i ve been feeling lost for years but with her i feel so happy and i love myself more if that makes sense   like i get motivated and want to be alive and better just because of her but without her the depression consumes me,0
t3_dlet1t,SilentPlead,i think i need help,this year started with me crying my eyes out from january to april almost every night and most days in broad daylight  at school  and at work but kept my head down  hoodie up  glasses  so no one would notice when i finally had had enough  i decided i was going to push all my feelings away and by some miracle it worked until this fall    i am in my third year in university  i am no where near done with my major  done with general education and general graduation requirements specific to my school  i was doing pretty well in class  showing up on time  doing homework in a timely manner and passing my quizzes until the end of september    it s now october and i ve cried every night and all day i have this sickening feeling in my chest that will not go away  my head becomes too loud at night to the point where i can hear my head screaming at me  telling me that i m not doing anything with my life  that i m useless and worthless  i m afraid to sleep  to just lay in the dark with my mind  i don t want to wake up and face the day  i don t want to face my job  my classes  my family and other people  i m failing my classes now because i can t get up in the morning  i haven t seen the morning for almost a month because i end up sleeping until  pm  i wake up feeling like a failure just to sleep to make the pain go away   i type and i type  again and again to this sub but always delete it because i think i m bothering someone  i think i need help  i don t think college is for me but i don t want to quit  i don t want to suffer but i want to disappear and die  i don t want to die because i don t want to hurt anyone but i don t want to keep existing  i feel so alone like it won t get better  it might but i m just so tired    back in february  i ve even wrote multiple suicide letters to friends and family  i took selfies the night i was going to commit suicide because i felt clarity  i felt as if it was okay  that everything was going to be okay once i did it  i wanted the last pictures of me for my family and friends to be of me  smiling  to let them now that i was happy  happy to commit suicide  yeah it s weird but you don t understand that feeling of relief that it was going to be over  i was so happy cause i had a plan but i didn t do it  i didn t do it because what if i was still lost after all that  what if my little siblings found me  i don t want that nor want to be a lost soul  i don t want to be freaking lost  but it just hurts so bad  please i just want it to stop  i hate this so much  it s so bad to the point where i go from a  self harm  mindset to  maybe you should go into inpatient treatment   none of my ramblings make sense but thank you for listening ,1

t3_dlju1t,allstyle777,telling my story ,this year has been one of the hardest in my life  even if nobody reads this i think it will help for me to get it out there    i am someone who under normal circumstances suffers from depression and anxiety  and when my life isn t on fire medication and some therapy keeps me more or less good    but like this year has just been too much  just going to list all the things that have happened so far   my wife and i just bought a house and since have been a little house poor    this february our furnace died on a day when it was     f  we had to divert money we had saved for my wife s maternity leave to pay for it to be fixed    then we had plumbing issues to the time of     dollars    we then had our son which was wonderful and terrifying  my sleep evaporated   for a good cause but further exacerbated my mental health issues    after my paternity leave came the worst event  the day i returned from leave the owner of the small company i worked for told me he could no longer pay my salary  to my knowledge we had no money issues and i did not see this coming  this was my worst fear realized  not going to lie  for that day i got home and collapsed on the floor a total wreck    i scraped myself up and got out there with vigor to get a job  each rejection hurt more than it should have  each week that goes by without landing a job i feel more and more useless    while driving     miles home from a free lance gig where i made some good money   the alternator on my relatively new car died leaving me stranded    miles from home  the tow home and repairs i personally did all but negated the money i earned    i then landed a temporary gig where again my car had issues  at least this time i had aaa and the tow wasn t expensive  but i was stranded for many hours on a friday i was going to go home early and relax      weeks after that i had a really good interview somewhere that could be just the break i was looking for  i was on the phone with my wife  both using hands free  telling her about how great the interview was when she was involved in a car accident  an f     plowed into the back of her car  i heard her scream and glass breaking  she did not respond to me     seconds went by  i was frantic  i thought she had died  she then responded that she was ok abut needed to go  she had a major concussion whiplash and bruising all over her body  but she walked away   that s all i really cared about    this last week i was offered a really promising job with a great salary  i finally felt like things were taking a turn for the better  yesterday they retracted the offer citing that they wanted to cut costs    so today  i m just feeling defeated  i ve been treated like garbage and had so many things happen that i don t even feel like getting out of bed anymore  this is just the short version  there s things i m either missing or just not remembering  i just feel like so many shitty things have been happening i can t imagine life ever going back to a happy place ,0

t3_dlqesk,TheLightwell,where do i find the help i need ,i ve lived check to check barely scraping by for most of my adult life  i ve been living with family for years because my fianc  has degenerative disc disease cannot work     of jobs  has been unable to hold one for more than a couple months and trying to get a place on one income in the usa in this time is damn near impossible  at least in my state  wa   we ve been trying to get her on disability but it s like trying to pull the teeth of a rabid hyena while juggling swords that are on fire  government just don t wanna give it out   we have a two year old son  and this is important because at this point in my life he s the only thing that keeps me from sticking my gun in my mouth and saying goodbye to this shithole we ve created  i m extremely suicidal  but would never follow through because i couldn t take myself away from my son like that  it wouldn t be fair to him   but living in misery is tough  i try to fake it  forcing smiles and cracking jokes to keep others unaware of the turmoil i feel in my mind  heart and soul  the governments of the world are all corrupt  there is no place left where people can live comfortably without working the vast majority of their lives away in jobs that are either meaningless  menial or unsatisfying  millionaires hire lawyers so they can find loopholes in our laws to allow them to evade their fair share of taxes  the    class has all but fucked the rest of us out of lives worth living  i have a decent job  apprenticing to become a residential electrician  and i know eventually money will come but it will still only be enough to support my family   i don t want to live like this  in a place of injustice  homelessness and hate  these problems have to have solutions  they need solutions  and i feel like given the time and funding we could solve them but with the way today s current structure is made it feels like insurmountable odds are against solving these problems and instead just want to place blame on whichever political party opposes your view   i need help  my mind is on overdrive      and i used to smoke weed to help alleviate some of my constant sadness and anxiety but now it seems i ve developed an allergy to it and it just makes these things worse along with trouble breathing  a rash and insane headaches  my life is not all that bad  but life in general seems worthless lately  like what is the point  idk what i need  but i think it starts with talking and expressing my feelings so that s what i m trying to do   i don t have insurance right now and even when i get it through my job i don t know if it would cover a psychologist and i couldn t afford one on my own  if anyone has some kind of advice please share it  i m sick of living  i m sick of how toxic society has become  people don t wave or smile at each other anymore  they don t hold doors  they don t talk like they used to  it all seems so fake and like it s this facade we ve created to simply keep confrontation and negative feelings away  i need something real  please ,0
t3_dk7le9,NoSympathy32,why not is the question ,i m a loner with no family no friends  mental health issues  constant suicidal thoughts daily more attempts than i can honestly remember    three this year   trapped in a horrible society  where no one cares  because when your life is great why would you think about others   happy memories are non existant  and to top it all off i ve genuinely suffered my whole life   and that s not an understatement  was i born unlucky  i m starting to think so   and before you say go and get help from a professional i ve been down that route many times they don t care either  what i really need is money to start a new life but i ve given up on that delusional fantasy coming true   here is a pearl of wisdom i came up with to remember me by     unity is the key that will unlock the door to a better world   because  i sincerely hope one day mankind works together to end the sadness and pain people are forced to endure   you know what the truly sad thing is  we have enough food to feed the world   times over yet people starve  we have enough resources for everyone to have suitable accommodation but people still sleep in the cold while people just walk past without so much as a glance   the only solace in all this negativity i find is the fact i know some sort of afterlife exists  and maybe   just maybe next time  i ll be one of the lucky ones   for now i feel like going on living in a world soo dark is pointless  when you know it doesn t have a chance of getting better    let s hope i find my eternal peace soon ,1

t3_dlqn73,Sue-uh-side-all,i m pissed off about having to try so many meds,right now i m on   psychiatric meds at a time  the  th  th and  th i ve tried  with each med i ve tried i don t even know how many different doses  right now they all aren t working for shit though  which i figured by this point  and i called my psychiatrist and what she said pretty much translates to      well damn  come in tomorrow and we ll try    i guess      fucking christ  ive dealt with enough bullshit i should have something that works by now  it s hard enough to try antidepressants  antianxieties etc in the first place but when you try med after med and they all either do absolutely nothing or make you feel worse   how the hell can you not get discouraged to the point of just saying fuck it     so yep  now again i deal with the hell of  withdrawals from the old med and new side effects from the new one  best of all  it probably won t work anyway  they re gonna pull another one out of a hat since this is all random trial and error anyway and give it to me  i suffer for a few weeks  then come back for     ad nauseum     woohoo  i m definitely so very glad i was born,0
t3_dl64cw,immacutekoalabear,on meds again ,i went off my meds  after discussing it with my psychiatrist  may this year  felt good  now i feel like shit  worst i ve ever felt in my life  i have a plan for suicide  literally the only thing keeping me from killing myself is me not wanting to hurt my family and friends   idgaf about myself  i just want the constant endless pain to stop  it s somewhat comforting knowing that i could end it any time i want in less than a minute  i started seeing a counselor   we ll see how that goes   first time i said that i want to kill myself out loud was today to my counselor ,0
t3_dl0xa3,springtimecool,i don t really see what s so great about being alive,consciousness is cool  i guess  but had i never been born i would never have known what i was missing out on  and what i m missing out on isn t that great ,1
t3_dlbk2b,DTfohnqotabocmod,i m not suicidal  yet,sorry for the long post   i tend to feel a little better aftet i get it all out    i don t know how many posts i ve made on different subreddits about my mom  i know she s gone through a lot in her life but i don t see why she feels the need to take it out on us  she s not abusive but i sometimes wish she was  the emotional abuse is way worse  it used to be that we didn t talk for a couple of years because we kept getting into arguments but we ve made up recently  i still despise her for what she s done to me but i ve forgiven her  i ve learned that from now on  if we get into arguments  its best to just apologize and take all the hurtful things she says and just move on  it seems so simple but i always end up angry and crying all alone even after i put up a brave face in front of her  i never cry but lately i feel like i ve just broke and all the strength i used to have is just leaving me  all the hope    today we got into another argument  my mom messes up our house a lot  in her eyes she sees it as saving money and whatever but in my my eyes  and my siblings  its just clothes stuffed in every closet and scattered around the house  pans and dishes stacked in the sink  tons of food stuffed in thr fridge and freezer  the floor is sticky all the time  the bathrooms are oily from her many  at home  skin remedies and we have cockroaches and all sorts of bugs  even though all of this is her mess  whenever she comes home  with more unnecessary stuff  she blames us for the mess  then she gets really angry and hits my younger sister s and screams at all of us to clean  our  mess  when we finally have the courage to tell her its her mess  she comes back with   i ve been cleaning up your mess all my life and now its time for you to take part in the house     last week  my sister and i cleaned up our whole house and made it spotless  as soon as my mom comes home  we tell her not to make a mess anymore and if she does  to clean it up  she laughs and says that she will  but everyday i come home  there s more and more mess that i have to clean again  today i asked her to clean go the mess in the kitchen since she made it  she goes off and says  what mess did i make  i don t need a kid to tell me how to handle my house  instead of insulting your mom  why don t you do something useful  do you think you cleaned the house because you wiped a few cabinets and threw away a few things    btw  the  things  we thre away were dishes and spoons that my mom put powder bleach on and left in the dishwasher for   months  i just thought it wasn t good to eat from that  and my sister threw away meat and oil that was sitting in the freezer for years    anyways  i tried to explain that the only reason i was being strict is because she always complains when the house is messy and we finally cleaned it so wouldn t it be nice to have it this way  also  instead of stacking up messes and then worrting when the manager calls for an inspection  wouldn t it be nice to not have to pull an all nighter to clean  plus  we spent   days cleaning the house by ourselves and i bought new dishes and silverware so wouldn t it be nice just to take care of the things your kids give you  but no  instead  i was yelled at for being a mean daughter who didn t care about her mother s feelings  how dare i insult her in her own home    as usual  i apologized  my mom keeps hurling insults  i apologize  again and again and again until my hands are shaking from rage and my throat is hurting from the ball of tears i m holding back  again and again until it finally slows down a little bit  i apologize one last time and i head out  i m sitting in my car right now  crying  angry  and i wish that i could just take this car and crash it  crash it so bad that there s a lot of damage done to me but not enough to kill me or injur me permanently  just enough to hopefully realize that maybe one day she ll loose me and maybe be nice to me  is it too much to ask  to just not be yelled at for anything and everything  to be thanked and appreciated    the only thing stopping me from doing it is the fact that i know she won t care  isn t that funny  she ll care about acting worried in front of the neighbors  she ll care about looking so motherly when she rushes into the emergency room and demands to see me  she ll care about all the  negative  attention she s getting because her daughter wanted to  kill herself   she ll only care about herself and how she s the victim in this situation  funny right    i know some of you guys might think that i m over reacting  after all  how can a mother think that way   i know she cares about you   you ll say  trust me  i ve been hoping that was true since as long ad i can remember  maybe i m just not seeing it through her eyes  i thought  but that s just the truth  when i m at hone she s calling me all sort of names but as soon as we step one foot out the door  all of a sudden i m her little angel    i can t bottle up all this anger anymore  i wish i can but i can feel it about to burst any second  i don t want to do something stupid ,1
t3_dlcdea,Erinb1217,my mind is killing me,i feel like this sick twisted person that does nothing but destroy my own happiness   i have this raging mind that constantly wants to be heard but no one will ever be able to listen because it s not only dark but it s like a magnet that pulls everybody in it s path and i hate that  i m a nurturing person with knives for hands so i see someone who needs something for their heart and i go to fill it to only drain it  i write music and paint masterpieces in efforts to deflect how horrible i am inside  i sing about love to hide that sometimes i don t feel anything  i paint oceans and mountains to escape the darkness in my head  and when i admit to anyone how dark and sad i am  they don t believe me because of all the brightness i bring  i don t get it and i want to  i want to be happy and i want sunshine  i want to feel everything good without all the bad drowning it out  but how ,0
t3_dl2xno,petriddled,an unfortunate existence,i don t really know how to start this or why i m doing this but i just want someone to know what s in my head even if it is just strangers so i ll just type out what s happened since it started cause i m trapped here on the floor with no escape but death and i really don t want to go   i was in early high school when i got the ear infections  about   years ago  the infection lasted awhile cause i had to change to different meds since the first batch didn t work but it was gone and that was that  or you d think so right  nope  over the next   years i would slowly lose control of my eustachian tube which is basically what controls ear pressure and whether your inner ear is open or shut  the condition is called patulous eustachian tube  pet  and it s a rare ear condition that not many people have  it took me about a year to self diagnose myself because doctors didn t know what was wrong  and it was later confirmed as pet once i could get in contact with an ent who understood the condition   it slowly took everything and i mean everything  what began as not being able to do extreme exercise or drink coffee slowly slipped to not being able to talk without preparing my ear for it because i d hear my voice from inside my body because my ear is in an open state  similar to when you yawn and they open and you hear your breath temporarily  to not being able to exert myself at all because if my heart rate goes up my ear opens and it s like a hurricane is going on inside my head   these symptoms happen constantly now  even without being provoked and while i have temporary remedies to stop my ears from opening they re really painful and just cause different more bearable symptoms  currently my only treatment is an estrogen spray that i spray up my nose and basically swell the tube shut which feels fucked but hey it s better than hearing my breathing and voice   there s not really any treatment for the condition as it s quite rare and the surgery suggested by my ent has only been performed twice in australia with underwhelming and temporary results and i m too scared to have it done because if it makes this any worse i don t think i could handle living  so basically the only advice i leave with every time is to gain weight but for the life of me i can t  i ve seen naturopaths and all but i just don t put on weight  it started with my right ear and the left was fine until about   month ago  fucks me what s changed   this is a text wall already so i ll get to where i m at now   dropped out of uni and quit work   months or so ago because i got to the stage where controlling my ears state was a full time fucking job of doing nothing but eat and don t exert or talk too much cause it ll fuck my ear and i ll hear myself breathe and talk from inside my body  sometimes even get to hear the blood gushing around my ear if i m lucky   broke up with girlfriend about   months ago which was mutual but sucks because i tried so hard to make it work even with my condition and still with my condition put in more work that she ever did  and at the end of it couldn t put me over her  she was sick at the time and getting sick makes my condition really bad and i d already been sick for literally   months and was just getting better  i didnt want to get sick so i said no to hanging with her and she had the fucking audacity to call my situation a  holiday  and she d have seen me if i was sick  oh and she didn t like that i smoked weed and at the time it was the only thing that fixed my ear  didnt have estrogen spray  but she didnt like that so that was my fault  i guess she was just like everyone else who thinks it s just a little ear problem when in reality it s a main bodily sense gone completely rouge and prevents me from using them at all for their purpose   so that was a   year relationship gone during my hardest time where my world is falling apart   my days and nights are now made up of playing runescape and smoking weed to distract me from the reality of living in my own body  where i constantly hear my ears crack  they don t clear pressure  i hear myself  my breathing and even my god damn blood flowing around my ears    i delve deeper into depression every day  lost an item on the stupid fucking game which was worth around    k aud at the time which was all i had and you are all probably like fuck this guys a loser but imagine not being able to go outside or have sugar coffee or any stimulant  or talk because it will fuck up your ear  so i smoke and invest my time and almost worth into this game trying to make it through my life without noticing life because it s fucking painful being here  i m always fucking mad because all day every day i have this shit condition annoying me and stopping me from doing anything i want without negative repercussions and the game i used to distract myself just reminds me of what i had and how far i am from that again just like being a normal human   and i don t even want to smoke  i m slowly losing my mind but without it my ears get so bad  i have no chance of sleeping and i begin to have an actual memory of how shit my entire day has been  and the longer i m sober the more shit days there are to remember   i recently got prescribed valium because i have very bad anxiety but didn t get that sorted before my ear fucked up and i can t go through finding what medication works for me in my current situation cause they all make it worse before it gets better   so i sit here  borderline addicted to valium because it s the only thing that takes away the anxiety and calms my ear  and i get paid      a fortnite which is instantly gone on my ridiculous amount of pills  ear spray  fuel and other expenses so i barely can afford food or to do anything  put my application for disability payments in when i stopped working and the meeting has only just been setup for next month so i ve got a few more weeks to struggle through just to see if they will allow me payments with my rare condition   i m so fucking stressed all the time that i just clock out emotionally and try let everything pass by until my ears do something that just inspires dread within me  dread of existing with what it just did  dread that it can get worse  and trust me it just keeps getting worse  can t sleep with hurricanes  was that sound from the real world or from me  fuck   i m sorry for so much text is a bit of a ramble and i might have doubled up a bit so i m sorry again  this is still just a generalization of the things i have going on and i don t think anyone would care to read a whole book of why my life s currently fucked so ill end it but if you made it this far thank you  at least after this   year sanity test i ll had hopefully left a memory about me with someone if i decide to take an exit  which at this rate i contemplate every day  challenging myself to make it through another one with this shit  but i m getting tired man   tldr  i m claustrophobic in my own body due to a rare condition and life fucking sucks,1
t3_dl0u5e,SengalBoy,what s your opinion on countries maiing suicide attempts illegal ,not a suicide post for a change   although i don t know if it is appropriate to post here  please note me if so then i ll delete it   so i found out in my country that suicide is illegal  in that if you were caught on a suicide attempt you will be fined an or face jail time  now obviously none of us condone suicide  despite yours truly admit that i ve attempt it myself   but honestly i took a bit offense at this   because people who attempted suicide are hurting enough  and they get punished for essentially a mental illness  yes  till this day mental illness is sadly very stigmatized in various countries  it honestly comes of as ridiculous  if anything though  putting them to jail sounds like a pretty shitty thing to do and might damage them further  and we do not want that   i get it though  in countries where religion is strong they did this in order to discourage suicide which is a noble attempt  but punishing those people  that s pretty cruel   what are your thoughts  again sorry if it s an inappropriate place to ask  i will delete if it does ,1

t3_dlnwnx,reptilianhater,is there a real shortage of psychiatrists in the states ,meds work for me  they have for the last decade   when i m on them  most things are good   when i m off  things are horrible   here is the states  meds are by prescription only   you have to get through a psychiatrist in many cases   regular physicians often don t want to touch psychiatric issues   but call any medical professional in the states and say you are a new patient   you will be asked to wait a month or more for a first visit   psychiatrists are a real minority of medical doctors   so  you re depressed anxious and suicidal   medications keep you from killing yourself  but you can t get a visit to get a  prescription for a month or longer   i m currently in a position where the shrink i was visiting just disappeared   no response for appointments  no answer from phone   shrink was part of a  service  that claims you can get online visits with your health insurance  which i m lucky enough to have insurance   it s crappy insurance  but in this  great  country  i m lucky to have it     so i start looking for another shrink   there s  two  that are listed   for the entire us   i call the service  and they won t confirm or deny that they only offer two shrinks  when i started several months ago  they had about       both of the two shrinks tell me they aren t taking any new appointments   probably because they are overworked   i mean there s only two of them  and    million depressed people   so i find a different online service   they also only have two shrinks   for the entire effin  country   i call the service  they won t deny or confirm that they only have two psychiatrists  and tell me i can only schedule online   where are all the shrinks   do i go to the er  just to ask for a refill of my anti depressants     i don t want to go a month without my meds  just because my shrink disappeared   so what s the deal with psychiatry in the us   why are there so few   why is it so hard to find one   i don t understand ,0

t3_dk0tck,thfrobtcr6,i wish i could get a nice big hug ,i was reading through most of the posts on this subreddit and feeling a lot more lonely than usual  and i realized that me and most people here just need a big warm hug   that would be nice  right  someone to hug  maybe on like a park bench somewhere  are there like prostitutes  but like just for hugging or talking to  i guess a therapist but that s kind of different  that s their job    do therapists really care  that s a good question  i wonder if therapists actually care about who they re talking to or if their just clients  if a therapist has an actual suicidal person at      pm and me at  pm and i m like feeling lonely or empty but not quite as suicidal as the guy at       would the therapist treat me like a waste of time  there could be a real market for prostitutes that just hug you and cuddle or something  if it was cheaper    crying on to someone s shoulder sounds nice  human interaction saves lives    if there was a person that was really awkward and couldn t really hold a conversation or just uncomfortable in social situations  would you just leave them  like not want to be in a relationship with them    i m never gonna lose my virginity and that sucks  but more importantly never fall in love or really be with people when i m older  i d that a reason to kill myself or should i just be a loner and suffer   i wonder if it would be suffering though  i could watch movies  ooohh maybe get a dog   does anyone have a discord  i just want someone to talk to  i want to like speak to another person even if it s not a video call that sounds nice  maybe talk about our favorite food or something  what kind of phone do you have  what re you up to  idk that sounds cool  there s someone else just vibing in the world somewhere  maybe some dude just chilling in his room staring at a poster at his wall imagining if he was the lead singer in a rock band   heck yeah dude keep rocking  i d talk to him  i wanna talk    talking to yourself can get boring    technically thinking is just talking to yourself but in your head  weird huh  i think everyone is crazy  it s kind of scary when you get really close to someone s eyes and look into their pupil they stop looking human  like think about how everything you see is coming out of some black dot on two little balls in your head  and same with everyone else  highschool is pretty okay  how s highschool for y all  or maybe  what was it like after high school  or maybe after college  or after retiring  so many different kinds of people could be reading this   that s kind of cool to think about  and every individual person has their own stories   or maybe only one person is reading this   hello  lol i guess it s cool that you read this far   what s up  haha    but just think that like all of this views on youtube   like with millions of views  some kid in canada just got home from hockey practice and he clicked on that same video  maybe a   year old in brazil accidentally clicked on it when he meant to watch   idk the alphabet game  maybe a    in a senior center in england watched it  so many people   that s pretty cool   here i am in my small room typing this at   in the morning  that s cool  maybe when you re reading this i m asleep  maybe while i was in the middle of typing this you were asleep  that s pretty neat right  what if exactly when i typed this sentence you were eating the last bite of cereal  i just blinked just now  what if i blinked exactly when you blinked  what if i just stood up when you stood up  maybe i m walking to my kitchen and you were too but we re like     miles away from each other  cool     but for real if you   you literally you the person who is reading this has a discord add me in actually trying to talk  i wasn t joking about that i want to talk to someone lol about anything i don t care  is it weird for me to put my discord account in this post  probably lol  come on i just want to talk to anyone i don t care who you think you are or you aren t or if you think you don t want to talk at all   i know you want to   lol that s kind of creepy but for real though    edit  i don t know why i thought discord was the only place we could chat  literally any social media works  maybe phone numbers but that s kind of sketch because i don t want a virus or something    tldr  there is no tldr just read it  i think it s pretty interesting,1
t3_dkeip5,throwawau101,i cant fucking handle this bullshit anymore but i m gonna put up with it anyway ,i have had to talk my bf out of suicide multiple times this week  i m basically numb to it now   no dont   please   dont   please dont   stop  it s all so repetitive  i basically am just like  here we go again  now  i just want it to stop but i know it wont  i m giving one word answers now  my heart isn t in it anymore  i m not crying about it like i used to  just kinda like    minimal responses  this is affecting my mental health  i cant handle it  i m only fucking     i ve had to talk   different people down this week  i m just completely numb  obviously i dont want anyone to kill themselves  otherwise i would just completely give up  but i m so fucking numb to it now  its basically a nightly routine ,1

t3_dlu20d,MyUsualName,wishing i could do more for others  and at the same time helping myself in a way,so  i barely make enough to meet my own needs   but i wish i had the means to help others struggling with depression  mental illness or whatever without the fear of like being put away   i wonder like if there were enough like minded people in a given area if perhaps money could be pooled to accomplish something like this    how it would help me  feeling like i mattered or made a difference would probably help quite a bit actually    any thoughts or practical ways to go about this  at least in my mind a lot of people do not get the help they need  a lot of people end up having no one to talk to about their issues  someone who really understands what they are going through and cares enough to try to help    like i would be supportive of like anyone could come in and have someone to talk to with no commitment to the cause  i feel like everyone struggles in their own way and could use someone to just talk to    is my idea crazy  i feel like these kind of resourcea should be available everywhere  instead hell  short of saying you are suicidal and contacting crisis just to see a shrink is months on a waiting list    just wish i could make a difference ,0

t3_dlcj1i,elquoi,she left with the cats and any hope of my redemption,long story short  she lied to the police    and while in suffered through the terrifying loss of freedom sacrificed for her inability to wrestle with guilt     but the time i got back  the cats   my children    were gone    and in those final days  she claimed fear and the victim card  oh she was so scared to be around me despite my never ever laying a finger on her  my years of bending over backwards to make her happy     but she was the one who assaulted me  she was the one who robbed me of my freedom  but frankly  society never believes the guy   and with good reason  i suppose    no  i never pressured her for sex  in fact  i d go months until she was comfortable    and that was probably a mistake  but i thought i was being a good life partner  i didn t realize that i allowed a lack of oxytocin interfere with her selfishness   unless i really am that bad  and if so  i deserve to die    anyway  i just want it to be over  or    i just want to see my cats ,0
t3_dknx0c,hardknocklife8,the only reason i haven t killed myself is because i have children,and if you think that places me in the clear of attempting it  your correct  doesnt mean i dont still feel like dieing  its more of a passive suicidal idiology if that makes sense   i m tired of always being treated like i m nothing  i have always been treated this way since i was born   as a parent though your value changes even more  you are simply a biproduct body which fills space  a body expected to to do and aolve everything  society says it   and the fact is i cannot rely on anyone or lean on anyone because i actually have no one to lean on  both my parents are dead  and i grew up in fostercare so even if they were alive they still wouldnt be apart of my life   here are some things i ll list that ive survived      homelessness and hunger for the entirety of my childhood      whitnessing drug and alcohol abuse by my parents as a child      experiencing childhood molestation      surviving the northridge quake      aurviving a building fire      surviving no parental love  literally no love or affection by my parents  i learned i was loved through a song at sunday school    surviving almost being abducted     surviving rape      surviving sex trafficking       having a gun pointed at my head       having my first child taken because i was a fister child and then working my ass off to get him back  the case closed because no actual reason was warrented in the first place       surviving domestic violence  having a knife put to my knack and getting punched in the head       surviving bullying  literal groups of kids that targeted me throughout elementary  middle and highschool   here are some things ive been told or names ive been called      peice of shit  white trump supporter   voted hillary      you should kill yourself      i hate you     you dont desearve love      no wonder your ex hit you  you desearved it      you dont desearve your kids      your stupid      your ugly inside and out      your a loser and will never amount to anything   here are some things complete strangers have said or called me      ugly ass white bitch      trying to make freinds i was told   i fucking hate white people   while having my food spit on and thrown at me      your nothing your artwork sucks and no matter what you know how to do you ll never be apart of this family      fucking white girl      old ass  buck tooth white bitch      half breed white bitch      scary ass hoe     i should fuck you up and make that pretty face ugly as fuck      aww  your so ugly you look just like your dad  so it goes to show  unprovoked i still get told these things  if i mattered then none of it would have happened and non of it would have been said  you see  after so much of it i truly believe all of it is true   i even went and got cosmetic fillers in my cheeks and for head and temples so i looked better  i still look the same ugly as he ll   if i had the money i d get a mini facelift even though doctors tell me im too young and dont need one  id get cosmetic dentristy to fix my buck teeth i apparently have  i actually dont i just have overcrowding from having my wisdom teeth come in  id probably get microblading on my eyebrows and tattoo makeup for my lips  even though im only     ibs id still get a tummy tuck too and hip inplants so i had a tiny waist and wider looking hips  if i had the money id get all of that done so i could be pretty like what people think pretty should be   if i had the money id pay someone to pretent they were my family so i could pretend i had one other than just my children   if i had the money i d pay for someone to erase all my memories of pain  but i don t  and so each day i feel like i m ugly  gross  that my race makes me ugly and gross  and that any struggle i ever went through is pointless because my race says i m priviledged by default  doesnt matter i was raped and trafficked because hey it wouldnt be as bad if i wasnt white and also raped and trafficked so by this logic i still have priviledge   anyone non white that puts me down and says derogatory insults is justified and if i stick up for myself i m in the wrong because i m white    there you go   enjoy  im fucking nothing and have no value and never fucking will ,1

t3_dl8l62,spacedinosaur12,my marriage makes me want to die   and i ve tried to end it myself,this whole situation makes me want to end my life  i ve tried a few times but didn t because i didn t know how my mom would take it  she s my rock   we both come from a pretty strict culture when it comes to the opposite gender  dating  and premarital sex   my now wife had premarital sex many times before we met  she told me that she had   boyfriends before and not long before we met and subsequently got married she met a boy on a dating app and was doing things with him as well  with her first boyfriend  she did not have sex with him but the two would give each other head for about a year and a half  there was a few month break between them when she met her second boyfriend  she started hanging out with him in ramadan   a month of fasting  and even kissed him   which would break her fast  within a month  of them starting to talk  this started in ramadan a few years ago  she had sex with him  the two would go to third about a week or two after the end of fasting month that year  this lasted for a few months and they had sex     times per month until he broke it off with her   months after she lost her virginity to him  fast forward   years and she starts talking to someone on minder  she and him start sexting and she would also send him pictures of her bare stomach and underwear  she has been wearing hijab since she was a young girl but has obviously taken it off for these men  making this a big deal   i noticed something was off when we first started talking  she would always reference her past and how it was heavy dark  i could tell she felt guilty of it but she kept bringing it up  she admitted her sexual past to me   weeks before we got married  she also told me that she s freely told many friends  without reason   i married her because i did not know how to explain this to my parents or her parents  her parents are very well known in the community and are completely unaware  they believe she is the model daughter   i did not think this would bother me  i have been in the talks with someone else who also had a past and admitted it to me  i don t think it would have been an issue except for the fact that she would talk to me about all the boys she has spoken to while in bed with me  talking about their bodies  she has compared my genitals to the genitals of the other men she s been with  she s told me that it took some time until sex with me was better than sex with her boyfriend  i ve suggested date ideas and she told me she is not willing because she went on a first date before doing similar activities and she did not like it   i married her partly out of guilt and also because she told me she had repented and that she was not that person anymore  i don t know what to do  she has hurt me deeply and i want to forgive and forget but i don t know how  islam says we need to overlook the faults of others but this seems like something more   i know i should have ended things when we first started talking  all of the red flags were there but i was enamored by the person she was presenting herself to be  she is working hard now to make amends and think before she speaks and take my feelings into account but i feel like the damage has been done  our premarital counselor said that this is a hiccup that we can work through and it can ultimately make us stronger but i can t see that picture at the moment   every time i look at her  all i can think is  this woman has been with multiple other men   she often claims that she is only mine but she is not   she is a few other mens  as well   her admitting all of this to me has made it very difficult to be in a relationship with her  i was abstinent and i waited until i was with her to have marital relations  it is really judgmental but i have these  why did i have to get someone s seconds   thoughts  i really hope this doesn t get a lot of hate  this is a very culturally sensitive topic that doesn t really fit the american standards in which we grew up in but she  even now  talks about how doing those things is wrong and she judges people who act in the same way she did  she even tried policing how i interact with women which i don t understand  when she goes to work every day and tells me about her male coworkers  i don t say a thing   all in all  i don t know if i even love her  i don t know why i married her  i don t have the money for divorce  and that one decision i made out of guilt is turning out to be the worst decision i ve ever made in my life  so bad that i don t want to live it anymore ,1

t3_dlirsd,Irrefutablecolor,just called the suicide hotline and after explaining how i ve tried every one of their super obvious step    solutions  and how each one made my life worse  the worker stopped engaging and said  well i guess you re out of options then ,i dont even know why i tried  this is the first time out of my last four or five calls to them that i haven t straight up been hung up on  but that s how fucking desperate i was for a fucking reason to stay alive tonight  fucking pieces of shit  everyone at those horrible hotlines  i still stand by my stance that the only people they help are people whose lives are actually fine or at least only sucking averagely in totally fixable ways  but are just having a momentary breakdown that is because of a mental illness making them not think straight  some of us aren t so fucking lucky that our lives sucking and being unfixable is all in our heads  and that we can be talked into seeing that again    she  while being rude and clearly annoyed the entire call  asked me why i even called  and i said i guess i was looking for at least one good reason not to kill myself tonight  when i explained further why each cookie cutter reason or solution she suggested was  provably  not true or helpful for me  she was audibly fed up with me and stopped even really talking to me other than to dance very closely around actually saying outright   well you might as well go ahead and kill yourself then if everything else has failed   i can t remember her exact words but she essentially said that if everything she suggested already didn t work that there was nothing else i could do  so i said she was right  that my question was answered  and hung up   which leaves me with   reasons   please dont try and suggest any  i    p r o m i s e    you i ve had plenty of time to ponder them in my    years of being suicidal  not an exaggeration  i m in my   s and its been a real shit life   i m sick of people treating suicidal people like we re completely unable to think about things in any reasonable way  sometimes people are suicidal because their lives  actually do  suck  we re not just  delusional  and suffering from an  inability to think clearly     i m not  confused  or  blinded by depression  and i might just knock the teeth down the throat of the next person to suggest that my wanting out of my shitty life that has only ever gotten progressively shittier  despite my absolute best efforts  is my own fucking failure  i can think  painfully  clearly about how literally every single person in my life  family or friends or significant others   multiple  now exes  obviously    has  in as many words     told      me i m a burden to them    that any basic resources i consume like food  water  energy  and shelter  are wasted on me  that i make their lives worse and they wish i would never exist in their lives again  i can think  painfully  clearly about how ive contacted every single resource there fucking is for disabled people  abuse survivors  poor people  queer people  any combination of such or any other resource you can fucking imagine  and not only have none of them helped  but my life has continued to get worse and worse while every single person in my life blames me for every instance of abuse i ve ever suffered  some of whom even go so far as to say that  if i  won t change my mind about being disabled   that i  might as well go die in a hole    direct  quote    sometimes we have tried everything and  reaching out  and  just taking some time to think about things  is not only what we ve been trying our entire lives  but has made things multiply worse by doing so  im so sick of the standard response to  i want to die because my life sucks  being some variation of the comment  then you just haven t tried hard enough to fix your life   or even worse and more invalidating   well you re just being too negative  look on the bright side   fucking trust me for eight goddamn seconds  trust that maybe  just  maybe   i actually  have tried  to have a less shitty life  tried with all my fucking power to fix anything that is anywhere near under my control  that just  maybe  i m  not  just wallowing and refusing to help myself because i like living this way  trust that i have only even made it this far by focusing on the sparse positives and silver linings  and that i m smart enough to find them if that s worked for a decade and a half already  even if only by the skin of my teeth  trust that if i say i m running out of those good things   maybe i actually fucking am   maybe give me half an atom of credit that i might have ever used my brain to try and help myself in some way or another  instead of insisting that everything that sucks about my life is somehow my fault for not being able to magically fix it or think of it as a positive  no matter how hard i genuinely have tried to  dismissive  condescending infantilizing fucking cockholes   i m just out   im out of reasons  im out of energy  im just   a hollow husk   im an amazing  talented  intelligent and deserving person  who loves bigger and harder than anyone i ve ever known  that  anyone  should be so lucky to have in their life  but nobody can see that  nobody cares  all anyone sees is a weak  freeloading  burdensome piece of garbage  annoying them and wasting space that could be used by more deserving people and i ll never convince anyone otherwise  why waste my limited energy even trying anymore if doing so just makes me look like even more of a pathetic  hateable tryhard,1
t3_dlc1hm,DailyDoseDepression,no remorse,they say i should already be dead  but i am just differently  it s slowly killing me to hear those words  with no remorse or thought of their weight  you have to save yourself because none else is going to and they really don t have any clue ,0
t3_dlieel,corroborationsneeded,am i depressed ,i m indifferent to almost everything  except for deadlines at school  if it weren t for school  i would lie in bed all day on my phone doing countless useless things  i feel ashamed and guilty of what i do that i avoid talking with others about myself  my knowledge on things or my hobbies  because i have none   i tried to be motivated  trying to do housework  to do sport  to read news and comment on them  etc but it all comes down to one thing  i get bored  have no concentration and give up too easily that in the end  i avoid social interaction again  i still live with my mom  who s super critical of everything i do but i think that if it weren t for her  i wouldn t even do anything  even she said that she notices i m too indifferent  i don t take care of myself  appearances  nutrition  social skills  and others  people around me  housework  school   i procrastinate too much until the end or when my mom and i fight  then i ll start doing things but only in the heat of that moment because afterwards it all goes full circle with me lying in bed on my phone again  i used to be suicidal  not anymore  but at times i really do wish i had never been born ,0

t3_dkqhnd,InnocentIchigo,just a stitched mouthed puppet,already expect this to be long so if you re not here for that then can t be helped i guess   working in the only variety stock retail store of a town of a couple thousand and the go to for a few nearby townships is stressful enough as it is  especially when working for a corporation that scoffs at the idea of giving us more hours to even possibly schedule more than   people working on a shift  let alone to hire anymore than we have on staff  so having to deal with the constant stress of having to either keep a store tidy where most customers don t care about if they smash into things and knock them over or throw messes everywhere  dealing with shits who like to steal or break things and not bother telling us and us getting scolded by customers who find shit like glass or spills and how we don t bother to care about hazards in the store when both of us can be struggling to keep a bustling line down and can t spare the moment to go clean it that instant  or getting reamed for even trying to begin cleaning it up and how dare we let the line back up so badly and how terrible we are at running a store when we re struggling to handle times  sometimes the span of a couple of hours  where       people are shopping and trying to check out in a constant flow    god forbid i try to go on the town s community page to ask people to treat stores nicely and be less harassing to employees  without even naming the store  and maybe to not let kids just break things because they want to play around and create a risk by their breaking something that leads to a danger to others or the playing itself being dangerous  cause how dare we tell children to not tear through the store at full speed without parents snipping at us to mind our own business cause who cares if the kids might slam into something and hurt themselves  and them probably trying to set us up to be at fault  or hit into the many elderly that come in and probably plan to just shove the injury off to us to take care of and possibly pay for because it s not hard for a lot of elderly to get hurt   oh no  can t bring that up so a discussion on how customers can be more mindful of what the workers have to deal with so they re not busy having to try and clean up a mess of a store while being screamed at to open a register because  surprise  when you re hardcore focusing on trying to tidy up as fast as possible you aren t paying full attention to the line   nope  have to get just a few people trying to spin it into drama and cause your family to start messaging you to delete the post or risk being fired  even though corporate can t see things in a closed fb group but i guess insinuating that enough people in town will just report it to get me in trouble   so whatever  delete the post  delete my fb  because i guess i m just supposed to be a quiet little doll who s just allowed to be beaten and battered by a company that expects you to be able to do the work of     people at times  which is getting to that point because holidays and inventory coming up  but customers also expecting you to keep the store super neat and tidy and cash them out and show them to where everything is and to sweep and mop up and to get stock out because they re annoyed at the fact the thing they wanted isn t in stock or being bitchy because sorry that we don t have    coolers in the back with all this extra stock of stuff that sells out fast and yup it s my fault that i can t just make our vendors deliver every day to make sure the exact thing you want is always here for you to buy   everyone just wants me just spouting crap like  oh just please be nice to retail workers  that d be swell  so everyone can nod and agree and pat their back all the while acting the same abusive way towards us because the actual issues in question aren t being addressed  because it s just so much nicer to remain ignorant to what s going on so they can be more in peace to scream and yell at us for things that we can t fix on our level  because trying to push workers to go at a      for weeks and months at a time isn t damaging to the body at all  because being so crass to things you d rather remain ignorant to so you have someone to yell at isn t damaging mentally   but  that s just how adult life is  or  can t make corporate angry  because fuck trying to maybe get a town to converse with a corporation to maybe install even smaller changes that could just be slightly beneficial  fuck i d take even a    increase be it just getting    extra hours to lessen the stress when we re getting our asses utterly slammed with customers  hell i d even just take them taking extra care to look into our store and seeing that we re a fucking smaller model of the one we re set up to be as and are missing nearly    feet of shelving sections that we still treated like we have  to have less stock for end caps given because so many of ours have changed to permanent ones that everything they sent just sits in the back that takes up so much room that fucking adds up over time when they do it with every end cap that we can t have  making it that much harder to fit stock from truck in the back and being yelled at because we have shipping racks on the floor because there s no where else and we can t get the hours to have anyone else come in or stay longer to work it so there s not at much   and fuck it s all i can do to just not be tempted to just slit my throat or down a bottle of pills because it s not like i can leave jobs either without a car and no other jobs are available because slowly dying town so just stuck taking this abuse and expected to just deal with it cause fuck if anyone will actually listen enough to actually understand and not give half assed retorts in response ,1
t3_dlejwd,somedewche,i wish i could let go of my sexual perversion and suicidal ideations,sometimes i go out at night walk around and i m comforted by the possibility that being a small lone female with no form of self defense means i might get lucky and get murdered  i ve been through some truly hellish things in my short life and i d rather go out now while i m still young  society doesn t seem to care much for older women and i am pretty shallow with a lot of narcicisstic traits it feels damn near impossible to envision things getting better for me in terms of living a humble  functional and fulfilling life wherein i can be an actual blessing in other humans lives and don t constantly rely on others to have my needs met  i believe i am on the autistic spectrum  older men in general seem to be attracted to me but i don t wanna be too comfy with that scenario cause they re a bunch of shallow fucks  too   being a musician entertainer narcicisst i seek out activities where i can feel most appreciated  amp  admired or at the very least feel numb but i ve finally begun to pray about my emotional dependency on alcohol  i m sure i can kick it but likely be one of those miserable bitter sober people that don t really do much to address the root issues  as far as my ego goes i can t imagine changing how i see life  the world and myself  i have wished to be murdered for a long time but being sexually assaulted or entangled in psychologically abusive exploitative relationships is as close to that as i seem to ever get  i ve been celibate for a minute and at the very least i have the self awareness to realize i don t seem to know how to treat people and am wickedly jealous insecure  against my better judgement i still hope someone will kill me  soon enough and quickly  humanely  enough ,0
t3_dl6nwv,throwaway8299,does situational depression get better ,i have been feeling symptoms of depression for the past     months  boredom  lack of activity  sadness  weight gain  etc  etc  i can attribute everything back to getting diagnosed with a major  lifelong illness about   months ago  i knew the diagnosis was coming so it wasn t really a huge surprise  but the permanency of it left me on the couch crying for a good week or two  i am in medical school  so i have a pretty intense workload and lately i have been quitting a lot of my activities and i am very apathetic about studying  which usually doesn t bother me at all  i have also gained about    lbs over the last few months  which just makes me even more sad    i guess my question is  does situational depression like mine go away on its own  i feel happy when i am with other people or the few times that i force myself to get really involved with an activity  but most of the time i am not in the mood  being in med school and already having chronic medical issues which require me to miss class means i don t have a lot of time for therapy or anything like that  as much as i would like to try it   any advice ,0

t3_dlru25,w4lternate,i feel bad but it doesn t feel bad enough to get help,i feel deeply depressed  like completely empty emotionally  and tired  i don t feel like i m able to express how much distress i m in when i try to tell others  i ve even been to therapy twice and both time i was frustrated that the therapists didn t see how bad i was exactly    i think i ve been aware of this for a long time  as i literally am majoring in psychology just because i feel like no one can help me but myself  but this is becoming too much   i feel like my entire being is suffering  in my head  i think about dying almost every day  i don t see the point in anything and nothing makes me feel good  but on the other hand  i ve never self harmed or made a plan to kill myself  i almost feel bad because it feels like others have it worse  and i m complaining for nothing    recently the thought that i should seriously injure myself to show that i need help has been creeping up on me  and i don t want to think that way  but it takes forever to get help even when you pose a threat to yourself or others  so i don t know what else i m supposed to do    has anyone been through something similar ,0

t3_dlrfv1,fukmyshittylife,fuck almost everything,i don t know why i m writing this  but i need to get things out of my head  and i have no one i can really talk to    my wife and i have had a pretty rocky marriage  pretty much the whole time  i was undiagnosed for a long time  and she had a pretty traumatic childhood  well  now it seems like things are over  and i don t know if i m an abusive prick  she s a manipulative gaslighter  or both  but everything is pretty fucked right now  i   really   wish i could just die  but we have a   year old daughter who is the only bright spot in my life  and i ve read that children of suicides are something like  x more likely to commit suicide themselves  so if nothing else i have to hold on for her   but i just don t know how to manage that  how do you live for someone who you can t ever explain to that you re doing it without unfairly burdening them  how do you ignore all the other shit in life and focus on that one reason to live  i want nothing but the best for her  hell even for my wife  but i don t what  the best  even is  will she be better off without me in her life  will she even want a dad who s the wreck of a person that i am  a fuck up who took til    to finish his degree  who got fired from his cushy it job and lost our house when she was   months old  who her mother says is a selfish abusive asshole who doesn t care about anyone but himself  maybe i really am  i don t even know how to tell  do i believe her because she s right  or because i hate myself  do i not have any friends because i m a piece of shit  or because i isolated myself from them  i don t know how to tell  and if i can t figure it out then how can i do what s best for my baby girl  is my wanting to be in her life a sign of love  or selfishness  and how the fuck am i supposed to tell   i m sorry  i don t expect answers to any of these questions  i just don t have anywhere else i can even voice them  if you ve read this far  i appreciate it    i just wish i knew what to do  what is right for everyone  i m pretty sure at this point what s best for my wife is a divorce  we ve been separated a month or so already  and every time she visits or we try to patch things up we have a fucking blow out the next day  i feel like i m busting ass without appreciation and she feels like i m not trying at all  but everything else    it just feels like it would be better for everyone if i just disappeared  is it better to break a   year olds heart and hope she ll get over it  or hope that in    years she doesn t tell me she hates me as much as her mother does and wishes the courts hadn t made her see me  both options make me die inside  and the only thing i know for sure is that i can t die on the outside   i m so fucking lost  and so tired of always feeling alone  everyone wants a rock  but this one is just made of paper mache  it s all hollow inside and will collapse if you put very much pressure on it  i just wish i could die   ,0

t3_dla93v,PJDont-Stop,the best way i can say this,you open your eyes and peer into a blank canvas  you look around you to see an ocean of colors to use to paint that canvas with  when you look at yourself you see an infant  you stick your fingers into random paint tins and get to work   amp  x   b   time goes on  you re a child now and unlike before your using a large paintbrush  the canvas is filled with color  it s vibrant and beautiful  something you would only expect from the mind of a child  you grow a little older  in your hands the typical paintbrush   unlike before your canvas is primarily one color   in a small corner of the canvas the primary colors everyone must know and need are prominent   amp  x   b   now you re older  preparing yourself to commit to your color full time   the primary colors in the corner always there  however  as you paint your color grows duller  your paint has dried out  that color no longer has any interest or meaning to you   amp  x   b   you try a couple of other colors you always acknowledged but weren t overly interested in before  those colors dry out quickly  you in desperation look to the many tins of color surrounding you  empty   as you look back to your canvas it s once again empty but this time you can t fill it  this time there are no colors  this time you don t know what to do  this time your lost  sad helpless  but the worst part  no one can tell anything is wrong when they look at you    edit  i m surprised i was able to get all this out  i m not much of a talker  or good at socializing these days,0

t3_dlsmmq,Blueberrybullcrap,guess whose back,this piece of shit  honestly i just want to take every bit of medicine in my house and then get run over  i m not even worth the time of a suicide hotline at this point  i mean what are the going to do tell me to take a warm bath and drink some tea   why can t i just be like most people my age and not have a bunch of mental disorders  i want to fucking hang my self but knowing my house the ceiling would collapse  how am i ever going to get better if everyone treats me like i m   and not serious about not wanting to live  i literally attempted last time i made a post on here and it was such a shock to these people  i had told them multiple times i was feeling suicidal but they just say shit like things will get better and suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem  like hoe when in life am i gonna get a nice dick and a flat chest   that s right never cus it s basically impossible ,1
t3_dldbm3,LucidListless,i m not interested in anything anymore,i just want to start this off by saying that i don t know if i have depression  i ve just started noticing things that fall along with some of the symptoms  and i m fucking terrified  i used to have so many things i cared about  but now none of them appeal to me  all i want to do is eat junk food and sleep  the idea of just waking up tomorrow and going to class makes me immensely sad  i feel so tired all the time  i make efforts to not talk to people even if i like them because it s so tiring  every day feels the same and i feel like my life has no path and i m trying to figure out my major but nothing sounds appealing  i feel like i can t talk to my friends because they will think i m a nuisance  but i m so scared and i don t know what to do ,0
t3_dl6gsu,RayDelMar_0,just found out it s  normal  for parents to really listen to their kids,i realized my mom never listened to me no matter the problem  it made me question whether or not she actually loves me  i ve always assumed she didn t as much as her real son because she treats him so different from me  i could panic over something  needing help or comfort and she d just shrug it off or tell me i needed to  get out more   that was her answer for everything    every problem i faced and came to her with  i eventually kept my mouth shut and when my problems became more significant  suicidal  cutting  dieting  body issues etc  i didn t say a word because i didn t want to get shut down by her  but when her son came to her with anything  she would give him her utmost attention and support through it  trying to help however she could  she would give him the shirt off her back if he needed it  only recently did i discover that parents were supposed to listen to their kids after coming across something on facebook that opened my eyes  i thought it looked silly  saying something like  tune in to your children when they need to talk  or something  but when i saw how many parents responded i found not one person opposed it the way i did  it made me kind of sad not going to lie  i wish i could ve talked to my mom without worrying about being judged by her  it seems impossible to me that any parent could be compassionate and actually want to talk to their kids  i feel terrible,0
t3_dlua6x,doriansafi,i didn t realize i was starving myself,i was blissfully unaware and happy  felt like everything was going right in my life  until my chronic illness started flaring up more  and i also got rejected after a few dates by someone i was fond of   and then i realized i had been starving myself for weeks  not consciously  no  i ve never been good at keeping a solid meal schedule  i never ate breakfast growing up  always had a low appetite  and in college it s easy to focus all your energy on work and forget to prioritize your nutrition   so yeah  i ve been eating like shit for the past month  and it s really taking a toll on me physically  i stumbled from pre syncope today while walking home   and i ve been going most days without eating at all until   or   or even   pm  and sometimes it s just a snack  i somehow powered through the stomach pains until i stopped feeling them and forgot what it felt like to be hungry   i am shocked  how did i not notice this earlier  this is extremely unhealthy behaviour  i love and cherish myself  how could i have neglected my body so severely   today i went to the grocery store with a meal plan in hand  i came home  ate a meal and prepped my breakfast and lunch for tomorrow  i m not going to let myself starve anymore   i will hold myself accountable and eat  here s to a healthy me  i thought i had surpassed my depression but no  it had taken on a quieter form in the background  i don t know how to address it but i will start by eating ,0

t3_dld9f4,EconomyFap,missed one dose of my meds,tldr had a great weekend  missed my meds one night the next day was a shit show  this will contain some mentions of sex  alcohol  smoking and some mental illness sprinkled in as all shitty stories are    so for context i ve been on meds to manage my depression and anxiety for a little over a year now  while most days are good  i m still in the process of getting a few minor addictions undercontrol  so this weekend i needed to blow off steam so naturally i planned a fun af weekend for myself  did everything i don t have time for in the week  i cleaned  i cooked  i had one fwb over one afternoon  then one evening was spent in the next town over with another fwb who also loves cooking for me and getting fucked up together  so all it was amazing i really just got to cut loose and indulge   so naturally  not long after getting myself back home i was a little hungover but pretty happy until i sat down to do shit for my lab tomorrow  depression came and beat me down like it s bitch  i couldn t focus  no motivation  binge eating  wanting to self harm  fuck just all of it for like   hours    once those   hours were up was it over  nah got thrown into a pit of anxiety  not cool when you gotta get shit done then sleep at some point  anyways eventually i got my shit done  despite my knowing better i caved and had a smoke    anyway probably about    hours into this bs i realized what my fuck ass had done  i got drunk and i smoked a pipe  but i wasn t totally smashed  usually if i get too fucked up i skip my meds for a few reasons  i ve done it in the past with no problems  today i guess i wasn t hungover enough to hide the fact my brain was straight up done giving me seratonin  i m finally calming down after taking my meds again and being a tiny bit not sober  i hate i have to do shit like this to function day to day  i shouldn t be relying on a steady stream of sex and alcohol on top of my meds to keep me feeling sane  maybe i should talk to a therapist about all of this  i don t want to end up on the suicide watch list again at my university though  due to money constraints i use my university s services for my mental healthcare   maybe i should just give in and find a girlfriend who would be down for my bs and also hold me when i m having a bad day  who the fuck knows  i think maybe now i can sleep  thanks for listening reddit ,0
t3_dkujhh,angstygopher,if i don t have anyone to talk to within the next hour  i will blow a bullet through my head,everyone hates me and wants me dead   no one has ever been nice to me   i m dying  and killing myself will be my last rebellious act   it s selfish for all you assholes to want me to live   for once in my life  i m going to do what i want to fucking do,1
t3_dkjj8l,iIIusiox,i don t want my parents paying for me anymore,i m fucking sick of this shit  i love video games  anime  watching netflix and my dog  but i m    fucking years old and not once had a single paying job in my entire life   i had a pacemaker at     got heart surgery done at   weeks old  almost became obese this year    lbs at age         height  but i lost weight and i m    lbs now   and my dad just lost his      acura mdx  white car a few weeks ago because he couldn t keep up with the bills since there s   other kids in the house who are ages        and      if you re wondering why i don t just get a damn job and pay my parents back  it s because of my weight not that big of an issue as much anymore ofc   pacemaker which limits my job listings with a ged after dropping out my senior year  knee problems  back problems  vision problems i m partially blind and still can t afford glasses   and the fact i can t stand up moving around no more than    minutes unless you want a mini pond in your store  no one wants a fat sweaty fuck with heart disease  medical problems  and a pacemaker that limits their carrying weight capacity  i least i don t smell bad and keep myself smelling fresh tbh    my mom spent a lot of money to have me lose weight this year  and it worked wonders  though i still have    pounds to lose until my initial goal of being     is finally accomplished  i still want my life to end  i ve honestly been stuck at         for the past month and a half  it s been hard losing the weight  it seems i have to push myself     times harder than what i ve been doing so far   though i know i can do it and finally achieve it around     months  at what cost did it take  hundreds  if not thousands for me to lose all that weight  my dad losing his car and stuck with using the family suv  and the fact he works    hours a day and   to possibly   days a week just to provide for the family and keep up with my medical bills  though sometimes every few weeks or a month  he gets a   day break   i should ve fucking died in that fucking hospital when there was a problem with closing up the hole in my heart that i had since i was a baby  instead  i managed to somehow fucking survive an operation that i otherwise shouldn t have and if they d continued or try again  i d surely die  and so the second time around  they decided to put a pacemaker inside of me  i believe that s when my life and my family s life truly went to hell   if god is real  then fuck you  asshole  should ve let me die in that operating room   i honestly don t know why i m still alive  why i didn t die when i should have and why i had to lose    pounds just before having obesity  i m stuck between   paths whether i should continue to see how much more of my pathetic life i could fuck up for others or just end it all now and at least know while my family will cry and mourn at my funeral  my family would eventually move on and truly live a better life without me   they can take all the money they saved up for me and the college funds they still kept  since i never went to college  and go nuts with the money  hell  i wouldn t even mind if they threw a damn party in celebration of finally getting rid of me and relieved that they don t have to live in that hellish world for the past   years anymore   my life was over the moment i should ve died on the operating room  i still question why i survived  i don t know if it was divine intervention  an instinct of my body for survival or simply pure dumb luck  either way  as far as i have known my life for the past   years  it s been total fucking hell  my life was a million times better before that day  my story should ve ended there  i just want all the painful thoughts and financial sufferings to go away   through all the bad  there hasn t been many good in my life since then  i spoil my little sister  smile back and make her laugh  while a part of me loves seeing her happy and is joyful at times  most of what i do is just all an act so i don t ever have to see her face sad and have her wonder why i m like this in a shitty situation  because then i ll be sad and become more depressed with her sad face   i believe her life would be better without me  i already think my    year old brother thinks so too  i haven t really spoken to him all year this year  and when we do  it s only about video games  anime and the usually chores around the house  that s basically it  i haven t really gotten to learn more about him this year and know about his life at school and out of school  and he s the adventurous outdoorsy kind of guy  so he has lots of stories to always tell  he plays video games too and loves to be lazy like me when he s home and has nothing to do on the weekend  but what guy doesn t   haven t really been that close to him anymore since then  after we have conversations about those stuff  he says  okay  shoo  close my door please   or adds in  go away  after the  shoo  part  but he plays it off like he s just being theatrical and messing around  but you can tell he s serious behind his  jokes   it s probably a hint telling me to leave him alone so he can have a peace of mind during the weekends and for me to finally just do it already ,1
t3_dlq7oq,lady_lazarus13,when you are asked  who are you    ,i sought some help recently   not the first time i ve made that effort  and i was asked  who are you    this question instigated tears immediately with the realization that i have zero answer to that question   tonight i sit here debating  what is my purpose  if any  should i just off myself and call it a day  what s the point of continually living in a perpetual hell   i do nothing for anyone worth mentioning and i guess i am realizing i am not really anyone    here s to hoping to make it through tonight ,0
t3_dlkun8,philthekinger,i have to get some things off of my chest,the title is pretty much self explaining   i don t really have people to talk to because i m anxious of annoying people      also if i dont let this out in some way shape or form  i feel like my head ist going to explode   disclaimer  sorry for my poor choice of words every now and then  i m from europe and not a native speaker  i ve always had ups and downs  some down s lasted     days and some last weeks  lately i have been feeling miserable again but this kind of takes over now and doesn t really stop  until now  it always was like that i felt amazing on the ups and horrible on my down phases and at the moment i feel the worst i have ever felt  there is a constant feeling i can barely put into words  all i feel is anger  sadness  hopelessness and just sadness overall  on top of that down  i just moved out of my parents house into a bigger city  i had to due to me going to university  a good       hours drive away and i miss them like crazy  because i always had a good bond with my parents  in addition  to that and the down phase also comes the doubt and anxiety towards the path i m taking  currently i am studying at university in order to become a teacher and i have a lot of doubt about that  it s a cool thing to do but it s not the real deal to me  what i really wanna do is livestreaming but this is another story and a rather small reason to my constant bad moods and sadness     today i even started tearing up in the bus just because i reflected my current situation and i just couldn t help myself and exited as soon as possible  i just cannot help myself and have more suicidal thoughts than ever  meanwhile thats bringing me down aswell because i cannot leave me family behind  i just hate everything and i just wanna sleep all day  stay in bed and not do anything   ,0
t3_dlfazj,kmdnn,i took the anxiety off  using alprazolam   now there s only depression     and i feel like absolute shit,yes the title is poorly worded  this is actually more of a question than just a story  felt like this fit this sub more than  r anxiety since the majority of it is about depression   so after i told my doc i had some pretty bad anxiety when on ritalin  which he prescribed me for studying   adding to the anxiety i have even without ritalin  he prescribed me alprazolam  xanax on the us i think   i ll just call it that since it s shorter   and holy shit does this stuff work  basically all of my anxiety was gone    minutes after taking it  and this one isn t even expensive like the other stuff  amazing  right   no  kind of  now  i don t know if this is just because xanax took the anxiety off and the depression is just taking over saying thank god now i can ruin his life in peace  or it s actually one of the effects xanax has on you  but my depression feels much worse  before  on most days  i could actually function  i gave at least half a fuck about taking showers and especially studying  or anything  but now  holy shit i m lucky if i can read a single paragraph before trying to stab myself with the pen i m holding out of frustration  also no desire to play games  or use the computer  i use my phone to browse reddit and that s it  if i take ritalin i have   hours of   entertainment    where i kind of want to do things  but after that  it s back to hell    sorry for the yelling  the question is  is it actually the xanax directly causing this  zombie mode   or is it more of a side effect of xanax eliminating the anxiety  leaving the depression free to do what it wants   if it s the former then great  just switch meds  but holy shit if it s the latter  my depression has gotten much  much worse than i had thought   ironic that i spent so much time typing this thing  maybe i am just lazy  i ask myself this question every single hour of the day ,0

t3_dkmk0a,EricDaBoiHimself,how weed turned my life around,i was     two years ago  and i live in asia  i was a sophomore with parents who grew up in communism  their ways of raising me were very close minded and now that i think about it  just plain bullshit  i had dreams of a rap career for about   years at that point  but i had been living without purpose and my overall interest for anything was diminished because i was raised with the mindset of  i have to know everything  and also  usually my parents or teachers or whoever tf  would make me feel soo soo bad for doing poor in school    now  even though i lived in an area where weed is strictly illegal  my friend who started smoking weed   years prior to me  he had family relations with a big drug kingpin  saw my ambitions of my rap career and potential personal growth in me so he introduced me to the hippy life    so from then on i was a regular smoker  i can t put into words how much i learned and realised about myself  especially if you re surrounded by the right people   i started to appreciate the beauty in life and overall my mindset was shifted in the right direction    stoner education saved my life ,1

t3_dl7kvy,nourm124,my boyfriend broke up with me,it s been like a month or so since we last talked  when i first met him online he was so insecure about himself and kept telling me how he doesn t like to open up to people because he thinks that they may think that he s weird and because hate seeing people like that because i myself am so insecure  so i d try comforting him and what so ever and hopefully he got some confidence in himself and i was so happy he did because finally my existence is useful to someone on this earth  however  days went by and things are normal till one day i had a problem with my phone so i couldn t talk to him i kept sending him emails to describe the situation to him but he never replied and i was so miserable because i thought when i d be gone for a   weeks or so  he d at least try making at least the slightest bit of effort to contact me but  nothing  finally  when i had my phone back and i tried texting him again and was so angry because he didn t even try to reach me at all  he just replied saying  sorry i was so busy with my studies   i get that but the fact that he wouldn t take only   minutes from his day to text me  was so sad  however  we kept arguing till one i had a break i had a breakdown  one of those days where the bed was like a magnet and all i could do was cry  and since i couldn t talk to anyone about it i just started opening up to him and i though at least he d support me  but he didn t he kept telling me that i was overreacting and that i m wasting his time complaining about stupid stuff  and that just broke my heart to the point where i d just cry for a very long time and think that everything about me  is worthless and maybe it actually is   one day when i decided that i ve had enough i just asked him right away if he still loves me and he just said no  he said he didn t  and that just broke me    he broke up with me after i d lifted him up  and made fun of my sadness when i just needed some support  he just broke my soul and maybe telling this story wouldn t just take the pain away because that s not how the world works but i just needed to get this off my chest  i know my story might sound stupid  but   i don t really know anymore what s real or not ,0

t3_dlctkv,cbddaddie,i tried to admit myself to a psychiatric facility and they said no,a few months ago i was living in my apartment and attempting to prepare for the upcoming fall semester  i was battling my new bipolar disorder diagnosis and generalized anxiety depression diagnosis so it was a hard summer to say the least  i wanted to drop out and move back home with my parents but i was stuck on a lease  i have never felt more trapped in my life  i was constantly getting these invasive memories of moments in my life that make me uncomfortable and made me feel like i was crawling out of my skin  i was just going to working  coming home and sleeping that whole summer in an attempt to not feel like garbage  one morning i woke up to a panic attack and decided to call a hotline and the woman asked me  on a scale of     how likely are you to commit suicide right now   i said like   and this bitch asked to put me on hold  i immediately start to panic more and call my grandma  i told her that if i don t get check into a facility i m not sure if i m gonna make it through the day  after going to two different kaiser s  they take me in and have me talk to a psychiatrist  the first of many  and she straight up said  well   i don t think you re really a harm to yourself at this time but if things change don t hesitate to come back     i ve never felt more helpless and tiny in my life  bitch who gave you a degree bc you re a fucking idiot  sometimes i feel like even if i did commit toaster bath tub  everyone would still find some way to make it seem like i was wrong or not justified to do what i did  like do you have to walk in with a knife to your throat to get some help  she suggested groups therapy and now i wish i would have suggested she go fuck herded but i was too flustered in the moment for that   fast forward almost two months and i m living with my parents  dropped out of college  and in a battle with my landlord roommates to get off of my lease  my roommates think i m a bitch for wanting to move back in my my family in an attempt to fight this which is beyond crazy tbh  i started a few different meds shortly after my failed attempt of admission but they aren t doing shit  today just sucked so bad and i started thinking about that day a lot and it wont leave me alone ,0

t3_dkdw8g,rodentboi,ahhhhhhhhhhh,i keep ranting on reddit because i suppose it s the only outlet i ve got    i don t know what to do anymore  i think sometimes i should go to a hospital  but i m afraid to because i have piercings and tattoos that my parents don t know about  also my brother went to the hospital and they tried to diagnose him with psychosis simply because he was praying a lot  he doesn t have psychosis  he s just really fucking religious     my mom is so fucking concerned with her own emotions  i have a friend that i fell out of contact with for about a year because he was struggling with an ed and he ended up in the hospital  she asked about him and i said that all i knew about the ed was that he was a bit irritated that people were so on him about eating because he was fine  i don t know if i believed it  i m not sure  but i understood  and i was empathetic  i mean  i can t begin to imagine the shit he s gone through   i told my mom this and she called me a fucking enabler  because i was empathetic  she said that i should ve said   gee  don t you fucking realize how hard it was on your parents    like yeah  that s what someone in that state wants to hear  not  god  that sucks  and i m here if you need to talk   no  he wants to hear about something that s gonna make him feel even more shitty    and that s how it is  she always cares about how these issues affect the parents  or her  or my dad  never the child  never me  she never thinks about how shit i must feel sitting down here thinking about hanging myself  she thinks about shitty she feels that she has a suicidal child    in the car  during that conversation  she also mocked me and laughed at me when i said that she was abrasive and rude and arrogant  she can t take any fucking criticism  i fucking swear  her response was   well you are  too   so i said   yeah  but at least i m fucking aware of it and can understand where people are coming from when they get annoyed with me  at least i m trying to be better     last time i checked i don t fucking laugh at people who are annoyed at me  i don t mock them  i m not a childish bitch   that shut her the fuck up  but i m still fucking pissed    there s just so much  y know  and it s all too much to explain but the bottom line is i want to die really bad and i don t know what to do  i thought about finding rope in the garage  thought about breaking a razor  but i m here  and i still want to die  i don t know what to do  i don t know what to do ,1

t3_dkfi1v,RL2397,sometimes it feels selfish to even want to kill myself ,i know people love me  and the thought of taking away my existence from their life and bringing sadness upon them feels selfish  but staying around them makes me feel like a burden    it s never ending cycle of not knowing what to do and the only escape is death  even death is starting to feel selfish now  the need to have never existed in the first place is immense and everything feels pointless ,1
t3_dl7ivy,BrokenBenjamin,fear sadness is a parasite,i believe fear is a living entity   something that burrows into our minds and feeds on people that don t see it  or choose not to fight it    things it whispers to us day  amp  night     you ll never be worth love     you ll make a fool of yourself    you re all alone     you re too weak    no one cares for what you have to say   and when we listen  that parasite is kept company  is fed by us withering away in a hole   and not leading our lives with courage     amp  x   b   my suggestions    when you feel that voice  the parasite has a mighty one    know that it s not from your heart or brain  it is an evil that wants you to suffer    tell that voice to go eat a dick  and do what your heart really wants  when you fail  or look foolish  or get rejected   the voice will come back stronger    tell it to eat a fatter dick and watch when you finally succeed    over time  that parasitic evil devilish voice will realize you won t listen   and will fade away     amp  x   b   the people who post on this subreddit have spectacular hearts  care for those around them despite a world of abuse  and just want a peaceful end to it all    the reality  however   is that finding a better life and a better self takes fight  not fighting yourself  which was born into this world as a pure innocent being   but fighting a parasite embedded in us by society  or perhaps some ethereal and evil force that preys upon us     amp  x   b   these thoughts and my new outlook came after trying to shoot myself in the head twice on october   th  but the police say the bullet  failed to seat in the chamber  twice  and here i am today    i ve put off writing this because a voice deep down says   it won t make a difference  or  others will make a joke of your thoughts     but i have to fight and say fuck that parasite in me     amp  x   b   i have a million things to share  but this feels like enough for now    i really hope that you guys will make this fight with me  and we can help kids realize the demon they fight isn t themselves   it s something sinister that burrows in our deepest  darkest fears ,1

t3_dltgvd,inclinedtodestroy,struggling  clinging to life ,this is the first post i ve made  so maybe its a way to share my story without the pitiful feelings   to start  my depression is diagnosed in the severe debilitating range  my depression keeps me in this bubble of isolation and paranoia  and self mutilation  i am the type of self harm survivor that will turn heads  my local cashier wont sell me razor refills or pencil sharpeners if she s on shift     this makes life hard  and because of my anxiety  i notice every glance  i take to heart every comment about it  i have completely made myself as undesirable and as disgusting as i feel  i hate the person i am  even though conventionally i am not that bad of a person  graduated   years early at     i m an artist and poet  i tell my story through these images and words that flow from me  but no one takes much notice to the person behind the canvas    the person behind the canvas is struggling so bad right now  i see my dad slipping further and further into a dementia like state  he forgets entire events that he planned  he forgets my name sometimes as well  calls lamps the  small light  and watches the  wrist timer  and i can t imagine a life without him  i just can t  all the abuse  the childhood neglect  he saved me from it all every time but its dawning on me he wont be here much longer  and i ll be stuck with   kids  the younger siblings to look after   i ve been through hell and back but i feel myself slipping farther and farther back into this dark demented place  i have few friends  but the one that matters most to me keeps me going  but i know it is all temporary  like me  i guess we all return to the worms eventually    i just wish i could make everything stop  and yet still effect no one  i want to go invisible  so no one gets hurt when i am left behind ,0

t3_dltomz,SageOfAnubis,can t take the voices in my head anymore  i want to end it all ,i ve been having a lot of mental trouble lately  whether i m at work or just with my roommates  the voices tell me to say bad things    very bad  awful  illegal things that could put me in prison  i don t want to say them nor would i ever act on the thoughts ever  but when i push the horrible thoughts away  i repeatedly tell myself  no  over and over again to try to get it off my mind   my mind pushes me to want to say them out loud  it feels almost compulsive  it s especially bad at work  i don t want to go into details  too graphic and disturbing  but every time i interact with a customer  the voices start to tell me bad thoughts  and every time i tell myself no it pushes me to want to say it out loud  it brings me extreme discomfort and after the interaction i start to worry whether i ve said it out loud or not and start to panic internally whether i did say it out loud and they will end up telling my managers what i said and call the cops and arrest me  even when i m with my roommates in silence  i m still tempted to say things that would make them literally want to kill me or get me arrested  i can t take this anymore  my mind is turning against me and i don t mean anything that comes to mind and would never act on it  but i m worried i ll say the intrusive thoughts out loud and would ruin my life forever  i m sick of this  it s an every day occurrence and it s driving me insane  i feel like the only way for it to stop is to off myself or be alone for the rest of my life with no interaction  i m just sick of this shit  i don t know what s wrong with me ,1

t3_dlllt8,AnomalyBrain,i starting to lose hope,i ve been battling with bipolar disorder for   years now  obviously the disorder involves bouts of deep depression  i take emotion stabilizers so i don t really feel the hypo mania anymore but i still fall into depression  i started this school year actually feeling normal and dare i say depression free  i was full of motivation  i worked really hard and i felt happy  which to me was almost an alien feeling   then out of nowhere it all came crashing down  i started to get panic attacks  i can t focus on anything  i either feel emotionally numb or i burst in to tears and i generally feel like a failure and a disappointment  my grades are going to shit and so is my attendance  i struggle getting out of bed in the morning and i have to force myself to take a shower  i stopped enjoying the things i used to love doing like playing guitar for example  i often sit and cry whilst remembering the days where i didn t have to battle with my own mind and i felt actual happiness  whenever i actually feel depression free the illness hits me harder each time  i m starting to lose hope that i ll ever be happy  i feel like i m just destined to be miserable forever  all i want is to feel  normal  yet i feel like i m asking for too much ,0

t3_dlbwph,bbrown3212,really long post ahead  really would appreciate any and all input ,so i ve struggled with depression since i was a kid  i ve tried suicide before and have made multiple suicidal threats and gestures  this is coming from someone who has had every opportunity in the world to succeed and have been lucky enough to have a great supportive family  however i constantly feel like i m letting them down and myself down with not completing college  i ve been in college since i was    and am now     throughout my time in college i have failed enough hours to get a second associates degree  i ve never felt especially passionate about college or school in general  the only real positive i ve had with college is i met my current gf and we have been together for   years  while it has been great it has also given me another person to worry about taking care of  i feel like i can t really take care of anyone since i can t really take care of myself anymore  i have a really bad back and hip from my time in the air force and it has led me to believe i can t physically do much  i ve been stuck in a loophole with the af for over   years about my status and i haven t even begun the process with the va because my unit hardly knows i exist  i try to frequently call and email them on a bi daily basis and i either get no response or the same generic response of   we re waiting on this   with all of this in mind i feel pressured that i have to get an education to be successful  personally i don t believe a bachelors degree guarantees me success  but since i can t stand for more than    minutes and am not physically active i have no idea what to do  i help all the people i can around me when it comes to pursuing their dreams and goals and they are out achieving them  while i m very glad that they re pursuing their happiness i can t help but feel left behind  i ve gone to multiple therapists and it almost always goes the same with generic responses and the feeling of them not caring  i had a therapist for   years that helped me get through some bad issues in the past that abandoned me when i threatened suicide a couple months ago and got detained by police and taken to a mental health clinic  he had to go on vacation and he would talk to me in a couple weeks time  after that i just don t trust people anymore with my feelings besides my gf  she s currently in basic training and i don t get to talk to her besides letters  i m afraid that if i talk about how i truly feel then i will get sent back to that mental hell hole and rot away  lately i haven t done much  i take my dog out on walks and make sure he s happy  bought some groceries for a friend that i hadn t seen in a couple months  and i just laze around playing video games until   or  am  i have other friends spend time with each other without me because i probably suck being around  last time i was with them we went bar hopping and into a club  which i m terribly afraid of  had a mental breakdown and that was that  i know this post has a lot of back and forth in it  but this is how my mind is right now  the only time i feel comfort and peace of mind is when i play video games  i get to be the funny outrovert guy that i can be and have a great time with some old friends i ve been with for a long time and make new friends  i guess this is a bi product of the kid who had the silver spoon in his mouth growing up  i thought i had gotten over my laziness after completing basic training and going back to school after a break  but i ve come back full circle feeling like a complete loser  i have no idea what to do or where to even start  if i m being completely honest all i want is to have my dog  gf  video games  and time with the family  i don t care about what job i have  but at the same time i want to find a career i m passionate about and that won t hurt my back or hip anymore  i feel like i m quite literally in   different loopholes and i have no idea how to get out of any of them  i don t even know how to explain this in a coherent fashion yet here i am trying ,0

t3_dl9pwu,WallyyDev,i tried talking to people,i don t talk to people in my daily life  so i decided to practice voice conversations via some apps and    i remembered why i decided to live like i do  minimal social interaction    it s because i have a critical social problem  if i engage in social interactions like a normal person for more than a month  i will become non functional  which means that i become a completely different person  locking me into a state of suffering  not being able to reason for a few months in the best case scenario  the worst case scenario would be suicide attempt  i know this because both happened multiple times consistently in the past   on average    days to lose it   i can make friendships easily  but it would be psychological torture  and certain suicide if i solidify the bonds  i can t let that happen  don t get me wrong  i am happy right now  i learned to enjoy life without friends or lovers  it just took    years or so to get over solitude  but life is peaceful right now   i work from home  no coworkers or boss   chores don t usually involve complex social interaction  and i live on a place where i can run in the morning safely  i could live like this for ever  no friends  no lovers  no coworkers  no major paranoid thoughts  i m very boring but i like to live slowly ,0
t3_dlcjee,GirlyThug8,my life will end in suicide ,i feel like it s an inevitability  my life so far has been a steady stream of getting rejected  failing to make friends or really accomplish anything  and my family not even caring how i feel  i m completely alone and nothing in this life makes me want to stay  and i don t see that changing anytime soon  so there s really no reason for me to keep living  it s just a matter of when i finally snap ,1
t3_dlvihy,Asmodeuss1990,its   am and i can t fucking sleep ,so all i can do is just listen to depressing music while i reflect on my life so far  in the waiting line by zero   has been on repeat for an hour  i m turning    in a few months and i haven t accomplished anything  where the fuck did all that time go  what happened to me  i used to be semi happy  i used to have friends  now no one knows i even exist  i ve become virtually invisible  i let myself and everything else i love go  i used to go concerts all the time  i haven t been to any in over a year  i miss who i used to be  the truest version of myself  now i m nothing more than an empty husk  i hope i can escape this depressive rut i m in soon   ,0
t3_dls2n2,Notchmath,i don t understand self harm,i go through enough pain as it is i don t want to make it worse  i suppose i m lucky i don t have that as a symptom of depression too  but i ll admit i m curious about the thought process,0
t3_dkenak,Missing999,i m fucking done,   years in this world for fucking nothing  my life is a complete disaster  everything i do is the wrong choice no matter what i do and it never gets better  i m tired  i m tired  i m tired  it s like everyone else gets what they want in life and i m left all alone  everyday i lose more faith in god and i don t feel like my life is worth living anymore  i m a laughing stock   no more  i m gonna get drunk and cut my fucking veins and just bleed out  god is punishing me and he is waiting to send me directly to hell  the fucking nerves on that prick  goodbye to the people on this sub  you guys were the ones i related to the most and i have no one else to say my goodbyes ,1
t3_dlqsw4,IllustriousBaguette,i m stuck in this situation and time is running out,i need to find a new place to live within a month due to my current short stay contract ending  but with no pay  i also don t qualify for social payment   nobody will even consider me to rent their place to   i ve been without a job since february  i had to quit because of a burn out    depression and anxiety are consuming me  i live like a hermit and i have trouble sleeping  eating  existing      nobody i know will help me     i m at my wit s end  ,0
t3_dkk266,Sibito,it s hard for me to interact with people, i need someone in my life  someone to share my life with  it would do wonders for me  but    i have   friends  and minimal social contact  and i don t know how to initiate a conversation   how to keep it   besides  people around me are smarter and overall just better than me  socially  financially  etc     so it s hard for me to fit in    but all i ask for is someone    someone who can provide me companionship and emotional support  and all the superb things you can get from a relationship  and  of course  reciprocate them since a relationship is nothing if it s a one way road     i wish i had that     in addition  everyone i see around me is  most of the time  using their phones  most likely interacting with their social circle online     i don t have  a phone   social media  and i don t know if i should create a social media account  for example  instagram seems like a cool concept but what people do with it  flaunt their egos  determine someone s worth through likes   followers  is something that i loathe     to sum up  i wish i had an intimate friend  i just need one  no need to have an army of them  whom i could share my life with  the small things and big things along with experience all the marvellous things life can offer  it would really help me but i can t find one due to the reasons i listed above    people are superior to me in many ways so naturally they won t interact with someone who can t stimulate them     and that    makes me feel  bad   to say the least  ,1

t3_dl6xsn,an_empty_life,competing with a ghost,i was raised in a good home with a loving mother and father  my whole life i was a success story  by the age is    i won    grand in speaking competitions and did speeches and shows all over my state  every one told me i would grow to be a amazing person and that everything i wanted would be mine that  i was  descent for greatness   as i got older i realized that i could never be the person every one thought i could be  so i worked like crazy to succeed but it was never enough  no matter how hard i worked it felt like i was falling short  by the age of    i had founded and sold one business and started another i still own but it was still not enough every time i did not make a sale  or slept in to late  it felt like a i had fallen short   every day that passed that i was not a millionaire was a failure  i was empty  i had no control over my life i was a passenger watching as i failed to meet every expectation i was at a loss for what to do i needed something i could control  something i could turn to when i felt lost  that was when my addiction started   i do not think i am ready to share what i am addicted to because i still suffer from it i think that when ever i can get over  what ever this is i will share but until then i just can t  but i will tell you it is not drugs  it started small and for a while it worked i was happier  in control  and felt better but i realized that what i was doing was wrong  i decided it had to stop  i think that was the first time i noticed it i know it sounds cliche but there was a voice telling me to keep going and that if i stop i might as well kill myself because no one would want me after i told them what i had done  but i knew i had to end so i stopped cold turkey and it worked for about a month until i got in trouble i had done something stupid and got yelled at by my mother  afterwords i sat in my bed and the voice came back telling me had failed and that this was proof  i dived back into my addiction this time i want deeper because i it did not feel like i was in control i started doing stupid things to feed it seeking out meeting people online  the voice kept telling me it was not enough that if i wanted to be in control i would have to do more and more so i did i got so deep and pushed everyone away that could help  now i am    years old and still in as deep as i ever was but now i trust no one  if i tell someone they will think less of me or worst use it to blackmail me taking what little control i have in my life  the voice is still with me it talks to me every day telling me never to speak of it  telling me no one cares  telling me to trust no one and every time i fail telling me to kill myself  even as i write this the voice tells me that no one will ever read this no one cares  but i have to tell this story somewhere because if i do not i feel like i will explode  thank you for reading i do not expect anyone to get this far down but if you do  don t pity me  i know i chose this and i except the punishment     amp  x   b   thank you,0

t3_dl8esy,pnw_state_of_mind,what is depression  for me  ,depression is sleeping until the last possible moment  before i d be late for a job without fulfillment    depression is daydreaming about a better career  a better life  and a happier version of myself   but never having enough energy to pursue it    depression is getting home and taking a nap right after work   depression is losing    lbs  getting in shape  and still not being satisfied   depression is being told i m smart  funny  attractive   and wanting to be someone else    depression is waking up regretting another night spent with a woman i don t know  and won t ever care about   depression is best friends with my anxiety    depression is fueling my nicotine addiction    depression is overeating or not eating enough    depression is my failed engagement  and countless relationships    depression is being too busy for my friends  while i watch a show i won t remember   depression is never feeling like i quite fit in any social situation    depression is the product of my parents multiple divorces  and getting shamed for who i spent the holidays with   depression is replaying all the mistakes in my head  and being stuck in nostalgia   depression is not wanting to go to bed at a reasonable time  because i m afraid to start a new day    depression is  what s the point  ,0

t3_dlcemu,ganralph,self destruction as a goal,during the lower times of my depression  it s almost as if self destruction is the ultimate goal  i have bad coping mechanisms not because i think it s making me feel better but because i know it s bad and harmful and that is the reason i want to do it to myself,0

t3_dlsxq0,princ3vinc3,i m tired of being alive,today was decent  started off okay  i lost my dog yesterday  she died  so i ve been struggling with that along with family issues and now tonight i got told by my ex that i should move on and stop thinking me and her are together and if i cant just be friends with her then i should stop talking to her  thats all of what she told me on the phone  she told me to stop feeling the feelings i have for her  i just cant though  its rough because shes the one who ended the relationship not me  so i ve dealt with these feelings and having nothing to do with tjem for a while now  nearly   months   she s gotten over it so easily because she prepared for it before breaking up with me  i didnt have any time to prepare   she just said she wasnt ready for a relationship and we broke up  so how the fuck do i deal with that     i ve already cut myself because of that situation shortly after it happened for the first time ever i cut myself  thats how much this shit has affected me  i know shes not the only one  i know she s not caring much about how i feel  i know all of this  i just am at a really low point in my life to where i dont know where to go  i dont know what to do  im just lost  she s confused me this past week alone  she s wanted me to tell her i love her  she s explained how different i was from her other exs  she s said how better i am from her ex  she s said allllll this stuff making me think she possibly thought differently than us juss being friends  so now im getting shit on because she s been confusing me   i honestly just want to kill myself  i ve thought about it for a while now  i ve slowly just started fantasizing about not being alive  i think about it every night because every night i m in my room laying down  completely alone  no one to call text or hang out with  i have this one girl who i talk to who is now wanting me to just not talk to her if i cant be juss friends and act like it  plus i have this whole family drama situation going on that just seems to not end  its like im sooooooo fucking stressed to the point its not even possible to enjoy the day without worrying about something  i posted to my snaochat saying how much i want to kill myself and how much i just might do it  nobody really cares though you know   people take that shit lightly and just go about it like  pssh he aint gonna do it  he just wants attention  not knowing how much i am willing to actually kill myself or harm myself  i m really just tired of people  and im tired of emotions  and im tired of living  i just want to feel nothing  i just dont want to even be awake  if i can sleep forever i will  maybe thats why i want to kill myself though huh ,0
t3_dlsm00,ranji_shabnam,i made subtle progress in overcoming my undiagnosed depression   when i stopped treating religion as a source of happiness ,my mom s friend wanted me to talk to a religious leader about why i was upset  i ranted to him about everything that bothered me since i was young  and even cried a little bit  his bluntness pissed me off  though he wasn t a bad guy  he said i struggle with making friends since i m negative all the time  unhappy people are too attached to this world instead of the afterlife  don t blame my parents  marriage for making me unhappy  and stop comparing myself to others since everyone has struggles  everything he said was a damn cliche  and i felt worse after speaking to him  my mom was slightly smirking at me the whole time i ranted to him   later she said the religious leader was  realistic and practical   and told me i was upset he told the complete truth   this stranger off instagram was gentler with me  she pointed out i have a million images on how friendship works  and my mom s expectations of seeking happiness through religion don t match up with mine  this girl said it s okay for me to get angry at god and i probably have undiagnosed depression  my current therapist  of one month  was also more sympathetic like the girl off instagram when i cried in front of him a few times  he said i should let go of all the  fucking rules  i imposed on myself due to society and my culture  my parents  marriage did impact me negatively  and focus on making myself happy   and also added that i should let go of my mother s and brother s expectations of me  he and his intern also said it would be easier for me to connect to god after i found my inner peace   the stranger and my therapist already helped me make subtle progress within   months  i spend less time being lethargic and moping around since i suck at connecting with people  my anger towards god decreased a bit  i e   i stopped verbally  denouncing him  but i still can t make myself pray regularly    and just last week i stopped crying on a regular basis and stopped lashing out at my mom and brother when they hurt my feelings  my negative thoughts behaviors for around a decade have improved slightly   just because a stranger and my therapist did not resort to cliches in trying to help me out  and said it s okay to not rely on god for happiness  here s to hoping i can find energy to take proper care of myself soon   and maybe even learn to love god xx,0

t3_dlom68,lollapalozainfluenza,thinking about medication,hi all  i m a    year old female who has suffered with anxiety my whole life  as i get older i m realizing that it also is associated with depression and high highs and low lows that come unannounced and for no real good reason other than just being unhappy  i ve seen multiple therapists and psychiatrists  they all have told me to try out anti depressants  i never wanted to because    i don t want to be on something my whole life    i thought i could work through it on my own but that is way more difficult that i imagined with meditation and healthy practices and the depression is starting to affect my life    i fear gaining weight greatly because i work hard against my genetics to stay semi fit  can anyone offer any advice of what they have liked about anti depressants ,0

t3_dlg7s3,moepengy,depression soup,i heated up a can of soup and ate it today   it was the first time this week i made a conscious decision to eat and take care of myself  this week food had been an afterthought to my negative thoughts and self loathing  i would lie in bed for hours  thinking yeah if i just didn t move i won t need to eat  i ve spent whole days in bed watching youtube napping through the day  sometimes i would get out of bed and grab only a cookie  banana  maybe a pre packaged salad  a single meal followed by more sleep  other times i d get up only to get to my door with the intent to eat and lie back down numbing my feelings and hunger by endlessly scrolling on my phone    but today after breaking down crying in front of my co worker  starving myself for days  and gathering the courage to end a relationship with someone who i knew i was hurting by clinging onto because i hoped somehow being with him would cure my depression  i made a can of soup   and as stupid as this might sound i m proud of myself for doing it ,0

t3_dkfqdx,OmnisMorir,                          ,              on june           or at least around that time frame  i will kill myself  i m not looking to be convinced otherwise nor am i looking for help  i can t be helped  it s too late to save me  so  why this date  because on june           i betrayed and lied to my best friend  a person who i thought the world of and would do anything for  i saw them beyond just a friend  but family  and so did she  i ve never felt such genuine love or a genuine sense of bond  and i betrayed her and  i did so willingly                        i made a mistake  but one that could ve been fixed  one that could ve been forgiven  but instead of admitting what i did  i lied  not once  not twice  but several times  and i kept digging a hole that would eventually be too deep to climb out of  worse still  i dragged others into it  all the while  she kept trying  she kept tying to get me to tell the truth  she wanted the truth  she wanted to help  she didn t want to give up on me  but at every instance  i gave her no fucking choice             i m fucked up  completely broken  i m irredeemable  all the self harm i ever did  the cutting  the smoking  the drinking  the fucking overdoses   nothing will compare to the self harm i did by lying and betraying her  purposely cutting her out of my life  i just push people away  because i hate myself and i believe that i deserve that isolation  my depression has corrupted me so bad that everything i do is in service to the plan  but i m at a weird place in my life  where i finally realize that it s this illness that is forcing me  corrupting me to do this but i m so far gone that i can t do anything to stop it    and i m so filled with regret  and remorse that i m finally done  if my depression wants to kill me so fucking bad  so be it  but this time  no pussyfooting around it  it s time to do it right  i ve been doing research on overdosing  understanding the chemical intricacies and how best to go about it  and i won t go into deep details because that breaks rule   b   and while i want to kill myself  i don t want to provide anyone with information  i don t want to be the reason someone else kills themselves    and it takes time to stockpile without getting noticed    depression is a disease  a corrosive illness  like cancer  it eats you from the inside out  but unlike cancer   it corrupts you   if left unabated  it will slowly consume your thoughts and turn you into something you think you re not    you ll subconsciously and without really realizing push people away  you ll hurt them  and in turn hurt yourself  all for one fucking purpose  to finally isolate yourself enough that you ll finally cave in and kill yourself  that s where i find myself  at the point where i can see how all of this works but be so fucking broken and corrupted that i can t leave this place  to know that the only reason you re suicidal is because of this illness but also being unable to fucking fight because it s too late  it s like knowing you re being brainwashed but you re too far gone to do anything about it    gt you hurt someone  you betray someone  you re not you anymore  it s the illness  you tell yourself  you ll think it s the illness corrupting you  changing you  but then you wake up the next morning and you re still you  you realize  it was you all along  you just didn t know      come june       i will probably make an updated post  more details and less vague bullshit  just for now  i d like to write why i m planning to do kill myself  maybe someone out there will relate and maybe it won t be too late for them as it is for me    does anything i ve written make any sense  probably not  i ve written too many drafts for this  nothing makes any sense  either way  doesn t really matter  ,1
t3_dlnquq,JustJJ01,i think i m getting depressed   ,i really don t know why but there is this kind of emptiness inside of me     i just feel like there is missing something   it s not friends it s not anything about financial problems it s just my mind that s making me crazy i cant concentrate and focus at all and if i think too much i often get very sad     does anyone has experienced something similar and has some advice or emotionally support  ,0
t3_dlldjz,w2073,suicidal due to being left,i don t know how to explain my issue  my gf left me   months ago  i was completely broken even though i always knew she wasn t the love of my life  the only thing that kept me alive was going to the gym  during our relationship no one really liked her  specially my mother and sister felt like i was wasting myself  also i wasn t happy all the time  but she was the centre of my life   now i feel like not making any progress  every day i suffer  think about her all the time  i go out with friends trying to forget my pain  but in the end i can t keep my mind clear  when i m alone again i feel so disappointed because of my expectations to feel better   in general i m a introverted person  i ve never had many friends  i m afraid to remain alone  although people tell me i m good looking  smart and successful in studying i have no hope to overcome my current state of mind  i m afraid of the future  failing my exams  being unhappy all the time  i noticed that thinking about suicide makes me calm down in the moments i suffer the most  the thought of being free  not suffering every day seems extremely comfortable to me  i think the only reason why i didn t do it yet is because of ruining my family ,1

t3_dkskin,MrPickles44,what keeps you here  what is your reason for staying ,it can be small  hopeful  sad  blunt  logical  or simple  or multiple   i just want to know what it is that has kept you from finishing it and the reason you re still here    i don t have many good reasons to stay anymore personally  i have trouble progressing through life and seeing any sort of light at all anymore and that s honestly a huge understatement   i would just like to know other people s reasons or perspectives  i m just asking for you to be honest ,1
t3_dluj6r,Mr_Zippo,an anonymous scumf ck confession,   i don t know why i m writing this  i don t necessarily want attention  or deserve it  but nonetheless something in my mind deems it necessary to do  i have been anxious or depressed for the last   years of my life  i do not have contentedness on a level in which i can live my life without constantly wanting more out of it  i believe in nothing  i want for nothing in particular and don t know how to express these emotions in a way that wouldn t come across as disgustingly shallow or in any other way for that matter  i am sick  i have mental illness and addictions that simultaneously improve and become the expense of my mental health  it s cyclical now   weed  pills  alcohol    self harm   acid  sobriety  anxiety  depression  weed  pills     i don t have the patience or optimism to live in denial or hope  i don t want to die  i don t want to end my life  but i also don t know how to escape from my own mind  i hurt myself everyday  others cannot hurt me because i do not surround myself with people who are capable of such a thing  to know that your life is being lived in  a manner that is detrimental to longevity and contentedness  and simultaneously failing to change habits is paradoxical  but here i am again  writing to strangers for some type of affirmation that i m worth something to somebody   the responses are always the same  but counter intuitively  they make one feel worse  because  if other express that you benefit their lives even in the smallest way  you re left contemplating why you cannot believe them  or more fittingly  believe yourself when you tell yourself the same things  life is so very complicated  isn t it  imagine what mental gymnastics one has to go through to morally justify their position in society  the more i learn about the world and its inhabitants  history  and potential futures  the more i m left dazed and unsure  simultaneously grasping for some type of truth and feeling too tired to continue doing so  if one were to try to formulate their thoughts in a completely honest way  i think that nobody would understand them  i think that language lacks the complexity of the human experience  but i guess that s self evident  given that the human mind created language in the first place   therapy is probably the worst thing that someone that thinks like me can go through  it subjects oneself to tremendous trauma  only to be left with coping mechanisms and ignorance strategies  you cannot heal mental trauma when said trauma is inherit to chemical composition  the best human society has done is develop anti psychotic or mental inebriating substances to dull or augment one s inherit nature  i obviously favor the latter over the former  i write this  significantly intoxicated  waning off something that i never imagined myself taking  and experiencing ups and downs that bring on both fits of euphoric laughter and such despair than i cannot antiquate the feeling to the description of words   i miss being a child  before my grandparents died  before my mother locked herself away from feeling  before i grew to hate myself  before i tried to kill myself  before i regretted it  before i became an addict  before i tricked myself out of it  before i used people for temporary enjoyment  before i fell in love  before i was heartbroken  before i learned what society expects of those in my position  before i stopped caring about said expectations  before i sought attention from others by letting my personal issues out to dry ,0
t3_dlnoil,thecollenman,my journey to fight my depression has begun ,i ve been struggling with mental health for about    years now  but with it becoming a bigger issue for   years   i ve been seeing someone on and off using my school s free councilors and then this summer finally finding a therapist  sadly there is only so much that therapy has done for me  it has given me temporary relief  and the tools to fight my depression  but recently  being away at college has caused more problems  making it harder to keep my head above water    so i have talked to my therapist and my parents and told them that i now want to start exploring using medication  i know that it will take a while to get results and that it may take a while to get the dose right  but i don t want to be like this anymore  i want to be able to keep my head above water so i can do the work to stay better  just wanted to share this as it is a big milestone in my journey   cross posted ,0

t3_dlr5dq,fizzyfart,there is a beast that lives inside my brain  its name is depression ,depression isn t just sad  it isn t listening to hard rock  or wearing dark clothes and makeup  although these are the stereotypical notions     depression asks to be hidden from the world so it can thrive inside you     my life is good  i don t need to get help    if i tell my family they will start to worry about me    if i tell my colleagues they will look down on me    feeling sad makes me special  it s my little sad secret   that last one is extra tricky with a self loathing undertone     depression wants something bad to happen  to yourself or others  so your tears can be justified    because panic attacks while driving home from work make you want to drive off the edge of a cliff  then the pain will stop   but maybe i shouldn t die just yet      depression is procrastinating    staying up all night watching youtube videos to fill your mind with brain garbage  which is always a better alternative to your natural train of thought     depression is a bully     you re weak  you re gaining weight  you re eating your feelings  you can t even stick to an easy workout routine for more than a week  you re stuck here now forever    side note  how can a depressed person gather enough will power to exercise when all their energy is devoted to keeping themselves afloat    i like to think that i have a happy version of myself fighting to get out  after all  it s been over    years  and i haven t done any serious self harm  and i do have moments of bliss and joy  but depression has grown strong  it knows me better than i know myself  and it knows that no matter how many self help books i read  and no matter what prescription i go on and off  it ll find the perfect opportunity to take me down again and again    maybe this is the way it s going to be forever  i ve gone to therapy  for as long as my insurance covered  a whole   sessions per year   i ve been on prescriptions  i ve made a virtually stress free environment for myself  i have many tools i can use to bring me off the edge of psychotic breakdown  so maybe i can live with that  maybe identifying depression as a beast will help separate myself from it    although i feel like my  self  is slipping away rapidly  the dizziness  the tiredness  it all feels like my natural homeostasis             f  has great job  a couple of friends  a loving fiance  two cute puppies  and chronic depression est      ,0

t3_dlo348,newicerevelation,i fantasize about suicide everyday,and it s fucking killing me    i have like some moments of happiness clarity where i like appreciate life but just one little trigger and i just wish i d be dead  i also think about situations where i could die  like when i m at the train station  i have this little but kind of strong urge of throwing myself on the rail and i fantasize on how that would end up aka if i d die immediately and how people would feel and it starts to feel so right just to do it but the thing that stops me is that i get scared of myself that i could even think about such things  which brings me to my next point  i m so fucked up and i haven t come to terms with it yet  like i know what i m doing is wrong but it feels right when i do it  i m at the stage where i m too scared to do it myself but if any situation came where i d die  i would be so fucking happy to finally move on from this earth  i m kind if a visionary and i spent my whole life thinking about the future and how cool i d be but now i can t even imagine living past     i ve heard the  your still young  excuse too fucking often for it to have any effect on me  im also a stone in everyone s life  it s always the same shit  i get to know them  we talk for awhile  they start to distance themselves from me and i realise  that i never meant whatever as much to them as they meant to me  i think it s because i have attachement issues but most likely people just get bored of me  and after all that my pathetic ass still thinks i could restart a friendship lol  i hate being alone but i m used to it and it s the only way i can imagine  this post really went to a whole different direction than i originally planned and now i m like more depressed as before just like every other time in my life  ,1

t3_dljsrl,NotFrancis99,feeling homeless, long post  see  i was thinking about this last night and i just read a post on this sub that pretty much summed it up  but i still feel like writing my own    i m    years old  nobody ever beat me when i was a child  nobody from my family ever treated me wrong to the point of no return  i did very well in school  etc  i m not saying everything has always been amazing  because life s life and it has its ups and downs  obviously  but i ve honestly had a pretty normal and ok life up to this point  i ve had several medical issues but none of them extremely serious  everything s great from a material stand point  i have a job  i m studying what i like  movie directing here in argentina   i m not a spoiled rich kid that wants to get attention  if you don t believe that s your problem i guess  i m just being as honest as one can be to strangers on the internet    yet  i feel like i don t belong nowhere  i honestly feel homeless  i never ever want to go home  it s actually my last option of what to do in a day to day basis  between work and classes  i don t spend much time at home anyways  but when i have a day off and can t find nothing to do  i can t stand being at home  which is supposed to be a place where i can feel comfortable  i hear a lot of people say  get out of your comfort zone to feel better  and i just think  what is my comfort zone    for example  yesterday i went to the doctor and classes were cancelled so i was faced with the decision of either going home or finding something to do  i had no friends available  nor wanted to see them  and the girl i like was very busy so i didn t want to bother her  what did i do  sit on the street  roll a joint  smoke some of it and just sat there alone until i felt like going home  which was obviously a lot earlier than usual  i had fun  because weed makes that when i m alone  but it didn t feel right  not the smoking part  that is just ok i guess   this has been going on for almost a year  and it doesn t only happen when i smoke weed  so please don t give all the credit to it   i m not close to actually commiting suicide  and i feel    good    to be able to say that  i know a lot of you folks are really really close or have tried  and i sincerely hope you all get better and can keep going  i know this sound a bit like humble bragging  but i just felt like telling someone  and i hope some of you can understand    i feel like if no strings were attached  i d rather not have to deal with these situations  basically meaning i d love to not be here in this world right now  but i can t find enough justification to do it  nor do i want to hurt the people that  i believe  care about me  but in a way i think that if i feel like this is for a reason  and i m tired of blaming myself for everything  am i being selfish  i don t know  i just simply don t know what to think at this point   feel free to tell me if i did something wrong on this post  it s my first one here on this sub  i ve just been a silent reader for a few months   hope you all have better  great lives and can keep going on despite all your struggles  bye  thanks for reading  fb,1

t3_dkfhmh,RightAboutTriangles,this is why ,this is very long  i do not expect anyone to read it all  i just have not been able to tell anyone the full story  to be honest  there s a million smaller details i m leaving out  i m adding this after the main body was completed   but it s all the major points  i just have to get it all down and throw it out there  to the shapeless face of the combined anyone but no one   it started early in        first  in late january  my friend of     years and constant roommate of about    years said he was moving out  sad as this was  it made perfect sense  he had been practically living at his girlfriend s place for the past year  she has kids and wanted to move into an actual house  and it make perfect sense for them to pull the trigger and finally start cohabiting  plus  i was in school and i had been in the habit of paying for all of the semester s rent  his and mine  with my financial aid  then he would pay more over the summer    with the spring semester about to start  i could afford to live alone until may giving me ample time to find a new roommate  so again  sad  but only in a  adulting sucks end of an era  sort of way  but in the end not even approaching  bad    then in early february i found out i was losing roughly half of my financial aid  basically  i had enough to  afford school   tuition  books  etc   but with zero left over for food  rent  utilities  or anything like that    especially not      of it  as i was suddenly responsible for  btw  yes  i have a job  but while in school i could only work weekends and   trust me  i ran the numbers   there was just no way in hell i could do it  so i spent a couple of frantic weeks trying to find a quick solution  more loans  obscure financial aid sources  a quick roommate  a night time job that wouldn t jeopardize my gpa  anything    found some  but not nearly enough  and i was on a time crunch  i was registered for that semester  so if i couldn t find a way to attend classes and pay for everything else  i would have to unregister  which you can only do very early in the semester  otherwise it would really negatively affect my standing  all  withdraw  w s on my record as opposed to unregistering   so i bit the bullet and canceled my college career  though i m still try to tell myself its just  on hold   with only    credits to graduating   after three nightmarish attempts a getting a new roommate  some clever budgeting  a little belt tightening  and a raise and more hours from my saint of a boss  i found that i could   just barely   afford to live it the apartment on my own dime  it wasn t fun  but it bought me breathing room and time to be more discerning as i looked for a new roommate  and  for you nit pickers out there  yes  i was also looking into just moving during all this which yielded similar results  plus it would have meant coming up with first and last months  rent  plus security deposit  plus the hassle cost of moving    in february    in wisconsin   so things stabilized for a time   in march  my best friend was murdered  my world broke   the period of time from march till november is kind of a blur  i just know there was a lot of pain  i know that prior to this  i had routinely fulfilled the role of my friend group s resident amateur therapist  a role that i loved being in  and found rewarding  so i can understand when everyone was just as shocked and in pain as i was that they would turn to me out of long established normalcy  i could no longer fill that role  tempers flared  silly drama ensued  and stupid things were said and done by many out of grief  confusion  and pain    myself being one of the worst perpetrators  so i found myself suddenly very isolated  both as a result of flared tempers and my decision not to jeopardize any of my remaining relationships until i learned how to cope better   in november my mom went nuts  like seriously  off the wall loony tunes  nigh constant panic attacks  pervasive confusion that rendered her basically an imbecile for a big stretch of this  threats upon her own life as well as her beloved animals  it was bad  she was in and out of both mental and  regular  hospitals for months  they tried countless drugs before they finally found stuff that works    but in the meantime   though she didn t gain an outright addiction to any one drug in particular   she developed a very strong pill fixation dependency which put in constant risk of abusing the very medicine that was finally working for her  finally  by early march of       she was stable and starting to get her old self back  the doctors still don t know what triggered the sudden and explosive onset  but in the end she has been diagnosed with dementia  probably alzheimer  and an  unspecified  form of panic disorder  medication and therapy is working  she is improving but still noticeably cognitively and emotionally diminished  and will probably never fully recover   during this time  i hit a rock bottom  i really did not expect nor want to see the new year as      came to an end  this was my  suicidal ideation  period  there was no direct intent or plan   but my mom needed me  and so did my my sister  my sister   god bless her   just is not good at dealing with emotional shit  to her credit  she was strong  she handled most of the paper work scheduling book keeping stuff  but she lives over two hours away and has a very hectic job that she legitimately cannot take much time off from  although i did find out that she cashed in her remaining pto before it expired to take a week long vacation just before the turn of the year    whatever  she was stressed too and probably needed it   so i was left as the one actually there dealing with my mom directly on a daily basis  and playing double duty trying to help my sister keep it together  to be shamefully honest  i did this almost entirely out of fear that i d have to somehow figure out how to work all the shit she was doing into my schedule  not because i gave much of a shit about her    cuz  well  i was going through the exact same thing  she s my mom too    i was still reeling from the loss of my friend  actually  i hadn t even really begun the grieving process at all    to many distractions  too many fires that needed to be dealt with immediately   i was utterly emotionally and mentally drained  and completely isolated with no functional support for myself  in late january when my mom finally started to show real progress and seemed to be coming out of the woods  i crashed    hard  the light at the end of the tunnel turned my thoughts immediately and irretrievably to  oh thank god  now that that s all settled  i can finally be done with it all    this heralds my  actually suicidal  period  there is intent and i have a plan   i should probably mention i was  ha  i wrote  am  first  a psychology major  so while i am not expert  i knew a thing or two about things i should do no that things had gotten that bad  i went into therapy  got on medication  and reached out to some of the friends i hadn t previously alienated  i was also  obviously  still in regular contact with my sister  i still don t exactly what transpired  because i knew know its a really bad idea   but somehow i found myself telling her that i was indeed suicidal   it did not go well   if you click on the links over to the right that tell you what not to do with a suicidal person    she basically did all of them  but again  bless her heart  she wanted to help  desperately  she did her research  and occasionally listened to me   and realized what she was doing that was less than helpful  and there were many times that she was pretty damn good  i kept falling into this ever so dangerous trap of audacious hope  that maybe she would quit inadvertently hurting me  and i would quit lashing out in anger when she did and hurting her   but she just kept falling back into the habits of looking for the quick fix  or making it about her  strangely and quite disgustingly  for a time this actually kind of worked  a lot of the pain i felt was very much overshadowed by the ever mounting anger  not even remotely healthy  but it did functionally by me some time    so i guess to take what you can get   with my sister as a constant reminder of what does not work for me  and how i should not be treating the people trying to help me  i told my sister i was suicidal a good month and a half or so before i let my friends know  i kept my language couched in strict term of  depressed    struggling    not doing very well   etc    things went differently with my friends  i tried very hard to make sure they knew that my issues were not their responsibility to  fix   that i knew they had their own life and stresses and i did not want them to let me add to them  i thanked them profusely whenever i could  and was sure to mention specifically the things they said or did that were particularly helpful  and tried to inform them as gently as i could when things didn t work so well    being sure not to blame them  that i knew it all came from love  just that particular action did not have the desired result  i also told them it would be very helpful for me if they were honest if i was being a burden  if they didn t have time to talk when i called texted  or if they just really didn t feel up to it  that was completely okay  it would be much better for me if they just called texted whenever they had a spare moment and were thinking of me   and they listened  and slowly but surely the  i m sorry i m really busy right now  could you call later   and the  i m very proud that you called  but i m really kinda frazzled myself     become more and more frequent  and the the calls texts i got from them when they were able became less and less frequent  i haven t had contact with either of them in months   therapy  durring this time  was going well  for a while my therapist was working directly with my sister  and she even came up for a joint session  it was a bit soured when   i shit you not   the entire session was focused on how  i  could communicate better with  her   to be fair  i was absolutely doing many things wrong  and i was very keen to work on that  but for fuck s sake  could we maybe save focusing on the faults and failures of the suicidal person for the second session    i told my sister i could no longer talk to her when  in march  she told me that she wasn t willing to take time off and come up for that second session unless i could give her some  guarantee that we will make progress    i stopped seeing my therapist in april when  as the first real advice she gave on what steps i could start taking  up until then i had really just been telling the story of the past year and a half   she suggested i     go outside more  fuckin  duh  also i don t have a car  so as the weather improved that s just gonna happen naturally  which she knew   and    call my sister  again  this was her first shot out the gate    after months of telling her basically everything you ve read up to this point   life threw me a bit of a bone in may when i was subpoenaed to be a witness in the trial on the person who had killed my friend  to my horror  i had nearly forgotten all about it  for that alone i could forestall ending my life and get through the trial  i owe my friend that much and so much more   the the trial got delayed until october  so i ve been living in a state of limbo  waiting for that one last duty to be fulfilled  and then i can go  though i m loath to even put such tiny  fragile  thoughts into words    i m almost hopeful  the trial could be a catharsis  a closure  a turning point  it might give me a new avenue to start talking about i m going through that doesn t hurt those i m talking to  i know the trial isn t about me  and that s a relief in many ways  i can use something bigger and beyond myself to finally start dealing with myself in a way that isn t so damn personal and so fraught with danger and jagged edges  in late september  my landlord sold the property i live in  the new owners are opting not to take on my lease  and instead renovate and then charge more rent  i am be out of the apartment by the end of october    functionally evicted even though i ve done nothing wrong  yes  there is a clause in my lease that make this perfectly legal   and i don t fucking care  i haven t even spent a moment looking for another place  i know i should  the anxiety of what the fuck i m gonna do is definitely building  but every time i swear i m gonna sit down and do it  i don t  not once  oh well   the trial started last week  they re allowing cameras in the court room and it s all this little podunk town can talk about  holy shit  the number of  friends  that i have not spoken to in months in some cases  over a year in others that are calling out of the blue to ask  hey  how are you holding up    to which i answer  oh  i m fine  nervous and stressed out  of course  but glad to be playing my part     before they invariably want to hear all the gory details  or go over the gory details they just saw on the news  or give me their impression of how the various lawyers or doing  or give me their theory as to  what really happened   with glee and bloodthirstiness that is as disgusting as it is hurtful and insensitive  thankfully i m under sequester and cannot talk to others about the trial  so i can shut that down real quick   my mom has become obsessed with it  and no matter how many time i have told her i cannot legally talk about it    to anyone she just still keeps calling  and calling  and calling  every time its with the pretext of  no  really  i just want to know how you re doing   and every time i tell her i m not doing well at all  i m really in bad shape  and i get to talk for   literally  i ve timed it  it got that predictable   at  most  two minutes  then she s off to the races going right into trial  she guilt trips me  pointing out she just has no one else to talk to  and i m right there  and it s all she can think about  and she just wants to get a few things of her chest  and she wants just ask me a  few  questions    often she ll just start talking about it  i m also legally forbidden to learn about the trial  by the by  so i m not allowed to hear it    and she knows this   every fucking day since the trial started  most days multiple times a day  and when i yet again  i can t do this  i will not jeopardize the case  not even for you   she gets so sad and angry   they ll never find out    i just really need to talk about this with  someone    liar  she s mentioned talking about it with both her friends and my sister  when i reminder her of this fact  then it s  but i just  have  to ask you a few questions   or  the real kick to the soul   you  need  to talk about this  you re to taking it well and i know it    i ve stopped taking her calls as of earlier today   i feel terrible about cutting her off like that  she loves me and  if she could stop  she would  all of her behavior is because he ordeal has left her diminished  moreover  she lives with the torment of  knowing  she s diminished    which has been hell for her  i want to still be there for her in that regard  but i just fucking can t  plus  i know this makes me a shit person but  in many ways  fuck her  she has her friends and my sister  that s more than me   i ll squat here for as long as i can  and then be homeless for a bit if need be  i exist now only to get through the trial  do my duty for my friend  i ll also wait out a small grace period after the trial to avoid any gossip that my suicide cast some sort of doubt over the verdict    it s a slam dunk  so pretty damn sure it ll be a conviction    don t want them thinking i feel guilty over hiding some dark truth  small town  that shit happens   being homeless for a while should actually go a long way to cement that  so i guess that s a plus   other than that though  i m fucking done  all over but for the shouting   thank you for getting this far  i just wanted to throw a record of this out there somewhere   when it s over  if this post ever comes to mind  please think well of me if you can ,1
t3_dlt3od,existentialboredom19,there s nothing worse than mental health issues in high school,i can t get anything done  i can t focus  i can t think  i can t do anything  and by law i still have to somehow drag myself to school and pretend to be ok for   god awful hours while i can t learn anything anyways and then go home to not be able to do any assignments or study for anything and just feel like garbage  and there s the constant pressure of needing to get into college and so being entirely defined by the nothing i can do without giving a concern to my mental health  and i can t get out of this hell for another      years  i can t take this anymore  i m burned out and i can t take a break  i m starting to only see one way out  i just can t do this anymore  oh  and being  gifted  is a load of crap  all it gets you is bullied for    years and hopeless social isolation  some gift ,1

t3_dlh34q,Ana_Rosa_Aguilar,i need advice from depressed people  facing death ,for a long time i have known that i would suicide at some point  honestly i should have done it when i was    but i have been a coward all this time  i can t even cut myself because of fear  i just usually use the handle to hit myself  i really want that the moment i finally get the courage to die  i won t regret it  or at least not in time   i ve already started with thinking about death when i go to sleep just asking myself what happens to me  how others would react  if the consequences of dying matter  came to the conclusion that they wont matter to me once i m dead   i think i have made some progress over time  mostly i want suicide to always be an option  always be on the table  that when a spur of courage comes even my rational side would be convinced enough not to stop it   there seems to be a lot of depressed people that have dealt with way worse than me around so  anyone have any tips on how to convince my rational side  or how to get a spur of courage  any of your experiences that have led to any of these are also really appreciated  so feel free to rant too ,0

t3_dlf9jx,lancaster115,the pressure is real,this post is a lot of me rambling on and speaking my mind and i apologize in advance if it s confusing  but i feel that i just needed to tell someone about my thoughts   can t sleep and it s usually like this every night  so why not spend my time posting about it  ever since the school year started  i ve grown to depend on using melatonin or weed every night to help me sleep because it s almost impossible to sleep naturally now  here s why   i literally keep myself and my mind busy throughout the whole day so i don t get stuck in my own thoughts because it is almost entirely full of negativity  the only time i do get stuck in my own thoughts is when i am about to sleep and that almost always keeps me awake    i finished two years of college and ended up getting put on academic leave for my bad grades  because i lost the motivation to go to school and do homework  i blame both my anxiety from having to go to classes as well as my laziness  my dad then convinced me to do a semester of online courses at a community college  which i have also lost motivation to do  the shitty part about this is that my dad keeps believing that i ll do better and decides to waste his hard earned money to help me get through school  i already have one brother that has completely failed him and i am getting close to that  it just eats me up inside every time i get stuck in my thoughts  because in a way i m using him for spending money on a lost cause  i could ve never asked for a better dad  honestly  i wish i could prove myself in school  but just can t for some reason    after    years of constantly disappointing my dad with my horrible grades throughout elementary  middle and high school  i think it s just finally hit me of how much i am putting my dad through    i ve heard that working out really helps getting your thoughts straight and all  but i ve been working out nonstop for   months now and  nothing  it doesn t seem to be helping with anything except my physical appearance    about every night  i think  why not just go into my garage and end it now  wouldn t that just be easy for everyone and not have to be another useless and disappointing son  i then persuade myself to not do it just yet  i want to live life and try finding someone to care for  i have this small amount of hope that having a partner that i can love will help me get my life back on track  i am even pursuing that love right now  with a girl i ve known as a coworker for   months  but i m scared at the same time lol  it could definitely fail  who knows ,0
t3_dkqqnf,shinigamisid,a mood destroyer  that s what i am ,everybody gets sick of me  there s no exception to that  everybody has already gotten sick of me  if i stop being overtly depressed in their presence so that they don t feel obligated to deal with me   they talk to me because they re afraid of the regret or guilt they might feel if i killed myself   what more could i have done  that s why they talk  or pity  or in the hopes that their advice would be the magical solution to all my problems   but the truth is that i m like a piece of gum stuck to a person s shoe  you try to pry me off gently  but if it still doesn t come off then you give up and just try your best to ignore it  i don t know if any of this makes any sense  it just hurts and it s      am and i m scared to go to work tomorrow ,1

t3_dla790,184747382idk,the vine,i wonder if this is depression at all  i wonder if this is just what i am  and what i will be until i m not  i wonder what it feels like to feel  i wonder what it feels like to reach for the warmth of the sun   i ve grown so accustomed to sitting in my abysmal pit of darkness  it s easier here than it is to take a hand offering the help i need out  the hands that offer light  the closer i get to the surface  the more blind i become  the less i can breath  the harder i burn  i can think down here  in this empty cave  i m alone   and safe   is it worth the trouble traveling to the surface  to once again become a small sapling  finding the strength to branch out  all it takes is one little vine  one small  poisonous vine that will infect my weak roots  there s no stopping it  all i have to do is exist and it will grow mercilessly  like a parasite  weaving its  sickness through my core  intertwining with my branches  the branches i ve worked so hard to grow  it ll twist  and suffocate  it ll destroy everything in its path like wildfire  there will be nothing left but debris  no trace of what used to be   what could have been   the vine will win  and i ll be back in my abyss  i ll be in the dark  it s easier down here  it s quiet down here  i can think down here  i m safe in my cave ,0

t3_dkisep,Grave_Traveler,my last call for help ,i wake up everyday feeling like my time is over in this world  i can t help it  i feel like i have tried everything to change it  not even the prescriptions  i don t know what i am supposed to do  i ve ended up in a mental ward twice for my suicide attempts and that didn t even help me  so please can someone tell me what i am supposed to do  i don t think i can push through this any longer  i don t want to let my family  my girlfriend and my friends down  but what else has my life come to  the people i thought cared don t  my friends i called family pushed me away  and the girl i am with now i don t even feel like it s working  out  every second of my life is worrying and obsessing over the fact other people might leave me and i can t do anything to stop it  i have talked to the psychologist about bpd  but all they  did was diagnose me with adhd and adjustment disorder  so what does this mean for me  i have to take   pills a day just to pretend like i am normal and that doesn t even work for me  i just turn into this emotionless robot  so i will tell you again  my time has come in this world  and my life is over  just know that i always have loved you  j  a  v  m  l  p so thank you guys for being there when i had no one else  you haven t failed your job  i have failed mine  i have failed to push through this pain and get through it and all i can say now is that i am sorry for making your lives alittle harder ,1
t3_dlsg5c,zrex05,not in immediate danger  but disturbed by the thought that suicide for me is way more probable than it is for most  ya feel ,i have just a few more months left to go at university and i honestly feel like this is all there is to it  i really don t fucking get it though  i grew up in a good house  i have a scholarship at university so i won t drown in debt  i m about to get my degree in physics  my gpa is good  i m running ultra marathons      what the hell do i have to complain about  is life too easy  do i need to pick up a load and maybe then things will get better  my classes right now are really easy and i barely get hours at my part time job so should i look for more work  i have grown to hate physics so it doesn t help that i don t give two shits about what i m studying at university and the fact that i m probably never going to use it  so sick of  legging it out  until i hit the next chapter of my life  where i might find myself repeating the process  so either i buckle down and find something else to study after  even though i m fed up with being a student  or i take some shitty job that will probably wreck me from doing some repetitive task sitting for eight hours straight  i ve tried this kind of job on an internship before and only lasted two months  slammed a keyboard off the desk    i don t even feel like a person anymore with things to look forward to  it s almost like i watch myself and provide mental commentary like  it s waking up  it s going to feed itself some food  it might exercise  it s going to take a shower       if this is what my life is supposed to be like where i just sludge through and do what i have to do to live  then it s probably best to save the resources for someone else who has it together   the thing is though     i know that there is something to life worth living for  i got the chance to go out with friends a few nights ago and had a blast  had sex recently and felt great  saw some good movies  staying in shape  but everything just feels so lacking  maybe i need more responsibility  everything i m doing is easy and i have a ridiculous amount of free time on a daily basis but i have no idea what to fill the time with  it s so funny that i find myself envious of others that i see working really hard on a project or grinding something out  so obviously  i tell myself that i should get committed to something but i just wind up beating myself over the head because i have no idea what that something should be  in the meantime  i feel like i m watching time go by and it s making me feel like i m ready to die  despite the fact i m    which pretty much makes me a child on the grand scheme of things  i ll take any comments or words of advice  even if they are harsh ,0
t3_dkv08z,Retarded_cookie3,i m a waste of space,not going to lie  if i were aborted for being autistic i wouldn t even be mad  well i wouldn t be anything because i d be dead but you get he point   i can t function socially  i m ugly  yes i shower and have good hygiene but that doesn t change my unsymmetrical face  i ve never been able to have friends  throughout school i d get bullied and heated up  i grew y all quickly so it stopped because your average    year old is probably like     meanwhile i was         please save your  someone will come along   it ll happen when you least expect it   because it s lies  i ve expected it and haven t expected it and nothing has changed  i ve only known rejections  but why would a girl go out with an ugly autistic man when she could at the minimum get a average looking guy with a decent personality  i can t make friends so it s stupid of me to even think that i could have a girlfriend    i used to frequent incel type subreddits but they don t provide a benefit  they only make you more angry and tell you that self help doesn t work  it does but only to an extent  plus i don t hate women and i m not a  nice guy    please save your  it s gets better  and  there s someone for everyone  because it s a fucking lie  i m the freak that ends up    and a virgin  you might seen me in person and think i m normal but over time you see that no girls want me and no one wants to hang out so it then clicks that i m a virgin freak that s destined to be alone     you make all these assumptions and it s wrong  i m not fat or underweight  i work out  i eat well  i have good hygiene  i ve tried socializing  i have hobbies  im not a neckbeard  i m not a hermit  i know most of you will just read the title and type your typical projecting responses so thanks for the  help    ,1

t3_dkways,throw-away9193,i wish i could see the aftermath of my suicide,so many different reactions from people  the ones i d expected being my parents caring more about the hospital bill then about me even though we re pretty well off financially right now  as well as constantly making fun of me for attempting suicide and self harming  my brother and sister cared a bit  though they kinda didn t show it beyond the first day i got back from inpatient  i had   friends in my friend group at the time and i told one of them i d overdosed  which i ll never do again  not cause she reacted negatively  but because i caused her to be really overwhelmed and overthink it  while the other   were saying she was looking to closely into it when she said she thought i was dead  if i could see the aftermath of my suicide it d probably reaffirm my decision to commit suicide  with only   friend caring  but i m not gonna tell her if i m gonna kill myself or not  i don t wanna overwhelm her again ,1

t3_dledna,amiadick736283,was this the right choice , my girlfriend has had a really rough life  and because of it she s developed some bad depression and shes already got some issues with social anxiety and other mental issues   since i met her it s been fine  she s been happy when spending time with me and everything    recently it s gotten bad though  she started cutting herself and drinking her feelings away  she told me that she wants to kill herself so she doesnt feel the way she does anymore   i ve spent lots of time consoling her and trying to have her get help or take small steps to help her not feel that way but with all the advice i give her and options that she can pursue she s done none of them    it s been a week since we had a talk from   pm to  am because she texted me she needed to talk to me  she was almost blackout drunk and told me that she s realized shes an alcoholic and wants to change  she told me about how bad she felt and how she wanted to stop feeling that way so she chose to drink  she then told me she wanted to be alone and i knew better to leave and asked her if i could just stay and we didnt have to talk and then she confessed she was going to kill herself after i had left  so i talked to her about how that shouldnt be an option and how she can get out of the depression shes in and how theres so many people that are willing to help support her on this path  she agreed to everything and said she d start trying to do better and not drink or cut herself   it s been two days and i just caught her drunk and with new cuts  i previously told her that if she ever felt this way to call me and i would be able to talk to her to help her feel better  it kinda feels like a punch in the face that she didnt do that  and it kinda screams to me that she doesnt want to try at all to get better  all of this happening and shes been acting like shes been fine to her mom who talks to her semi regularly   shes been in and out of psychiatrists with no help because i feel like she doesnt want help  now because of her past she refused to see someone or take medicine to try and help   i decided that today this has become out of my control and i gave my gf a ultimatum that she needs to tell her mom about whats going on to try to get help and if she didnt  i would tell her mom  aita for not letting her choose when to tell her mom  if at all  i just care about her so much and it hurts to see her do this to herself and not try to get better  all she does now is push me away and not tell me anything so i felt like i absolutely needed to do this   tl dr my girlfriend has been in a bad depression and tried to kill herself and talks about how that would be such an easy way to not feel the way she does anymore  so i told her to tell her mom about whats been going on or i would     on the off chance this gets popular  please dont let it happen  i really dont want her to see this on the front page of reddit or anything because my gf occasionally will use reddit on her phone  thanks ,1

t3_dljxgd,Fickle_Mess,the questions that no one can answer fully   ,i often ask different people  family  friends  professional acquaintances these very legitimate questions   what makes life really worth living  why is life good  why is it beautiful    i personally find that life is one continuous shitstorm to be blunt about it  it s a constant struggle  more and more  i m feeling like i want out   some can never answer me  others flail around for an answer  others look like a deer caught in headlights  they act as if i uncovered a lie they ve been telling themselves   but all they say to me is   don t do it     don t give up    or  it ll get better    they act as if life is a cookie cutter  their happiness life situation is the same or will be the same for everyone else  that s blatantly false   i ve done things the right way  but nothing s progressed  setback after setback  every path i take leads back to square one  even paths that seemed really promising  they say   oh you re not trying hard enough   or  you don t need anyone to hold your hand   one problem leads to the next  some even acknowledge my troubles  but they still spout that foolishly optimistic nonsense    take baby steps   or  one day at a time   that s all i can do   is that worth it to you  i don t know how people say that  life is good beautiful   knowing the utter struggle it is  existence is painful ,0

t3_dk8b5b,Naturegurl27,my story,a background  i have recently started writing on fanfiction net  i wrote   stories and posted this on livejournal com  i really don t know when and if i will crack before a year is up  i am stuck with this lease  the two stories i wrote are related to  stargate sg      so  that s where cam and daniel come from    i think i should be banned from reading my own books  at the same time  i m grateful for them  thinking of something other than roaches  spiders  mice and lizards  thinking of something other than financial problems and having to live in this hellhole for a year  thinking of daniel and cam is a lot better  than thinking of those things    i guess that s why i don t care about my books becoming popular or making any money  it distracts me from the realities of how bad my life is  so  i ll continue not to care  i ll continue to make more chapters even  if no one is interested  it s better than thinking about how black my life is and how there s no light  in the end of the tunnel  at least  not for a year  it s gonna be a miracle  if i survive a year    i was working on a new chapter last night  it made me so depressed  i stopped  all i could think of  was i wish i died at     i would have never knew i would be kicked out of the house at    and my dad wouldn t show up to my high school graduation  i wouldn t know the first man that i would ever love  would turn me away and ask me to choose between him and god  i would have never knew that  i would be raped and abused  ruin my nose for life  be kidnapped and now  this year  having to file for chapter    being in a hellhole that has spiders  roaches  mice and lizards  being far from everything and can t drive  can t ride the regular bus  because i have cerebral palsy  yeah  to die at     would have been worth it  people say life gets better  yeah right  look at my life  it gotten worse  way worse  if i could go back in time  i would tell my    year old self   die  i don t care how  but mark my words  it s better than what you will face  life will not get better  not for you   but i m    years too late  now    the only light in this dark tunnel and at the entrance of this dark barrel  are my books  my imagination of something a lot better than this  i wish i appreciated where i lived before this  but  i never knew  how bad things could actually get  i will keep working on my books and hope that  i ll survive this year  the only promise that i can make is  i ll do my best  if people want to criticize how my books are  don t  just don t read them and walk away  simple and easy  i will not change them for you  they re mine  since i do not get paid to write them  the only real audience is me  but  if you must be cruel and leave a bad thing to say  just know i will ignore it  since you re not paying me to write for you  so  keep that in mind    keep writing and keep expanding your mind ,1

t3_dlt0xh,pbhoneythrowaway,have you ever read a monster calls ,i found this book a few years back  and i fell in love with it  i didn t understand why at first  because it was simply a story out of millions  the book consists of a boy watching his mother slowly rot away due to cancer  he s all alone  and is taking on the role of cook  cleaner  and nurturer within the household  as his mother ever so slowly falls into the arms of death  things begin showing up  his estranged father who lives in the states  his hardskinned grandmother who tries to treat him like a normal young boy  bullies who pick on him and call him a loser  and so fourth  he is in a deep pain  and feels invisible   one night  a monster calls to him from outside his window  the boy was terrified and frightened  but at the same time extremely pissed off  the yew tree monster threatens the boy  saying how he will tell him three stories in the coming weeks  when the third tale is told  the boy must tell the fourth  the boy  much smaller than the monster stands up to it  screaming his mother is dying  and this tree wants to tell him stories     three tales are told  the first talks about how life is not as simple as we might believe it to be   the second is about one s ethics and morals  and how even in your darkest moments  you must stand for what you believe in   the third talks of an invisible man   for if no one sees you  are you really there at all   the man grew tired of being invisible  and made sure everyone saw him   the boy was told by the yew tree monster that if he were to listen to the tales  then his mother would be given a branch from his tree  an attempt at a cure  his mother s last hope  if anything could heal her  it would be the tree   as promised  the doctors administered the last hope into the mother s veins  but it did not work  the boy heard the news and ran through the cemetery  to the hill that held the tree  kicking it  punching it  and screaming with a red face and tears running down his cheeks that the monster promised it would save his mother  it promised   springing to life  the tree rose from the ground and told the boy that if it could have healed her  it would have  she is simply too sick    no  no  no  you promised   the monster looked towards the boy and said it was time for the fourth tale  the wind picked up and the nightmare the boy had been having for weeks materialized  a crack tore the ground in two  and he saw his mother hanging on ever so desperately to a branch that stuck out from the cliff wall  the boy ran to her and grabbed her arm  using all his strength to try and pull her to safety    the monster watched as the events unfolded  and told the boy to tell the fourth tale  to tell the truth he has been holding in    no   the boy screamed over the howling wind   no  i won t     tell the truth   the monster screamed back  his mother was slipping out of his hands   i will die if i say it   screamed the boy    you will die if you don t  tell the truth  tell it  tell the truth     i just want it to be over    and everything stopped  and the mother was gone    i just can t stand  to see her like that anymore  i just  want everything to be over    the boy let himself fall into the ravine  but the monster caught him  and carried him back to the hill    you simply wished for an end to your pain  and that conor o  malley  is the most human wish of all    that night his mother died  before she left  he told her the truth  that he loved her so much  and it is okay for her to leave    amp  x   b   we never find out if the monster was real  but this book has stuck with me throughout the years  i did not tell anyone this story to attempt and change how they view death  it s just i m not feeling too good right now  and somehow i always seem to wander to this book every time i get here    life is fucking rough  and even though my monster has never came  i like to think that maybe i can become one   i hope whoever reads this will find their own story too ,1

t3_dlf45z,ImagineTheresNoHeave,this is it,i ve made my notes  i ve made my decision and i know now that i m going to do it  i was never truly happy and now that i know i m suffering through psychosis  i might as well end it  i ve seemed for help but each appointment is them telling me in a complicated matter that i m not trying hard enough and that things like medication take time  i shouldn t have to wait   months to talk to somebody  my mom neglects me for my little sister  i m alone and i drive alone i eat alone i play games alone and worst of all  i am left thinking alone  everyone knows i m mentally ill but don t even make an effort to help  even when i ask  i m just a nuisance and a waste of space  i don t deserve anything  i don t deserve to feel full  i don t deserve to have friends or family  i don t deserve to live  i love this guy i m talking to but now he s ghosting me  pretending he s fallen asleep on me and it makes me so angry   but once i remember i deserve all the shit that s coming to me  i just accept it without anger  i cut myself  force myself to throw up  but my head against walls  choke myself  everything and i never feel like i ve been punished enough  i beg the doctors to help me  i want another chance  redemption  but i have to wait   months to get into help or my other choice is to be sent in a mental health facility where they were be sure i take my medicine  i m such a good kid  i ve always been so nice to everyone and tried to fit in but  it was never enough  i ve been punished my whole life  i deserve to die  i don t deserve to cry and pity myself  i deserve to feel all the pain that s coming to me  i only post this so people can scroll past and maybe read what i have to say  i don t want to be talked out of it  i just want someone to convince me even more  i always wait last second for a chance but i end up disappointed ,0
t3_dlkfi7,YouareNotSmartDave,i will either hit the road and live homeless by choice in another city or i will off myself   ,i have been living in this nightmarish life of going to my boring as fuck humiliating day job to spending half my time at home over medicated i am so sick of it  it is this inescapable prison  impenetrable grid of hate and forlorn paralysis of fear and loathing  surrounded by people and their contemptuous scorn and cruel disdain  i ve been taken advantage of had all of my money sucked out of me by evil sociopaths  and then thrown out like a piece of trash  the only solution i can foresee is fucking everything here and hitchhiking to california  i currently live in columbia  mo  and living the homeless life  i just don t know if i can do it  i m    turning    in december  and i might be too old to live the homeless life  i don t have enough money to relocate and rent in ca  but i lived homeless by choice in santa cruz  ca and i did pretty well    hell i even got laid in my tent  but i was      ,0

t3_dlm89v,hmm-what-do-now,nothing works and everything is going wrong,i first noticed i was depressed my sophomore year of college  over the summer of my freshman year  my  friends  kicked me out of their suite and put someone else in it  i was hurt but was determined to not let that stop our friendship  i tried hard last year to stay in touch with them but they seemed to drift farther away  at that time my mental health definitely started to decline and i stopped putting in the effort  if they did not want to spend time with me i didn t want to spend time with them   they also hinted that since i became depressed i wasn t as fun to be around  and they have no desire in being there for me during this time  i ended up spending most days in bed unless i was doing something  i d still  study  go to the gym and call home  but besides that i just stayed in bed  i smoked almost everyday  not too cope or numb the pain but just to do something  i was bored  that being said it did help me with my plan  i tried to make every day so similar that it would feel like a blur  and it worked  time honestly seemed to fly by and the next thing i knew it was summer   side note summer  winter vacations  breaks are all the best  i am happiest when i am home  with friends that care  with work to distract me  during these times i m only sad at night when i m alone   fast forward to junior year everything got worse  the year started off well  i tried to rekindle my friendships at school and it did seem to get better  i also had a single room and had signed up to study abroad  solo  in amsterdam  i had peace in my room and i was excited to finally get away from my school next semester and discover amsterdam on my own  i then learned that i would be getting a new roommate  he was moved in because he sexually assaulted someone in his last suite and rather than kick him out they placed him with me  he was horrible  drunk and belligerent every night  made my room a mess  stole my clothes and finally caused so much of a scene that the school kicked him out  i was told he wouldn t be coming back so i decided to splurge  spent       on new fixings for my room  posters  sheets  etc to try to bring some life to the room  i was told last week that despite what i was told i would be getting a new roommate again  not only would this throw off my single room  which was the one thing giving me happiness at school but i also had now wasted a lot of money    at this point i decided i would try to graduate early  i had a few ap credits and just needed two extra classes  i am doing a winter class and was told i could do an internship over the summer for credit  today i was told that to do an internship even if i found it i would have to pay my school        to have it count as a class and that it might not even count since they prefer me to go for   semesters  i explained i was trying to leave this school as fast as possible and they said they d get back to me   in the meantime my relationships at school have all gone to shit  i have completely cut off ties with my friends  the purposefully exclude me now and i have heard them talk about how they wish i d stop visiting them on multiple occasions now   i ve been skipping meals and have already lost   lbs  already a skinny guy   and im not doing great in classes  the only thing i have to look forward too is my study abroad and winter and summer break  until then i feel like my situation is going to get worse and at this point everything feels like a waste  i m killing myself with extra work and stress and might not even gain anything from it  i think i can handle one more semester but if i can t graduate early i don t know what i m going to do   i m at a point where i feel like nothing i do matters and everyone is out to get me  i know this is a long rant so i hope it flows well but i ve never posted here and feel like i just had to get this all out in the open  i just want to be done with all of this so i can focus on myself and get back to work and out of this horrible school ,0

t3_dlu6xu,respectdwightfrye,never been diagnosed with any mental illness  but i don t know where else to share this,i m just going through the motions  i don t know what i want to do in life  i m getting a degree for a career that i don t know if i want   i procrastinate in my studies and homework  i have no intrinsic motivation until the deadline is breathing down my neck  i have no intrinsic motivation  i have anxiety if i have to drive anywhere  i just feel unproductive and useless  i have zero life skills  i couldn t function in society if i got kicked out of my parents house   i don t have friends  not one  half the time i can t look someone in the eye when i am talking to someone because i get overwhelmed or distracted   ironically  my short term memory has been terrible for as long as i can remember  i will forget what a person said right after they said it  and i write things down to help remember long term   i have mood swings  sometimes i feel happy  and that everything is going great  an hour later  and i will feel like garbage and that i have nothing to live for   i despise my father and i feel that i am a loser because i still live with him  he s got a short fuse  he never physically abused me  yet i spent nights as a kid crying in my bed and wishing that he died in a car accident so i d never have to see him again  but i think he does care about us  ultimately  he says  i love you  a lot  and i say it back  and i m lying  and it bothers me that i m lying  i despise him  yet here i am  still living with him  i wish i could leave these people behind   i just feel emasculated  i don t like myself  i don t like the people i live with  and i m too lazy or too coward to change anything   i have a porn addiction  that s how bored i am with life  and i have no life  i sit in the basement and procrastinate  i am tired all day  but i stare at my phone through the night   the highlight of my day is usually watching a movie  that s what i think about doing  i know and can remember a bunch of dates and names and films  but i can t remember stuff that i deal with in real life   what are my dreams in life  i ve am fond of being an author  but i hardly read anymore  much less write  i think about being an actor or a director  but i m too scared to do anything about it   so since i won t do anything to change my life  i sometimes think about committing suicide to get it over with  never even tried to attempt suicide  but i think about it sometimes  i don t think suicide should be stigmatized ,0

t3_dl8o9r,boi7896,nobody notices me unless i m suicidal,which just proves how little people actually care about me  the person i love doesn t acknowledge my existence  despite me being  important  to them  they have told me that their life would suck if i was gone but i don t believe that for a second  the only time they notice me or talk to me is if i m on the edge of killing myself    people will say  they don t deserve you  to which i respond   you re right  they deserve so much better than me   just a random vent  i don t know why,0

t3_dkrqiv,MonsieurBubbles9366,the walls are closing in,i think i finally have the courage to die   i haven t stayed at a job for more than a month for two years now  in debt several thousand dollars between my parents and the bank  at least i m caught up on bank payments   my car s maintenance light is on and will probably break down any day  i m going to lose my health insurance  and i only have enough money to buy food for maybe a week or two   i can t go through another cycle of humiliation after quitting another job due to anxiety  i have too much pride  and me and my parents empathy and patience for myself has run out   all i want is recognition at this point  my suffering to be validated  and for a bomb to drop in people s lives that kicked me while i was down  all cemented by a final act   i feel like the only thing that has kept me alive this far is that i m too cowardly to choose a more brutal method of suicide  and that i haven t been able to secure painkillers from the houses of relatives  i know the garage codes  just haven t found an opportunity    within the next week i will though  so for now i begin the preparations of cleaning and throwing things away  getting my affairs in order   the last time i was suicidal i couldn t justify it fully to myself  as others lives were on shaky ground  but now that everyone is doing well and passed me by  i feel like it s the right time  and that they ll be able to weather the storm   the only things that have helped me persevere these past couple years are art and politics  escapism from the world and antagonism towards it  beauty and community  but these passions have waned over time   i can t think of any individual in my circle that makes life worth living  but in a weird way i m grateful for this disconnection from those in my life as it makes the decision easier   the only beacon of hope i had left was psychedelics  the psych meds route not going too well   a chance to fix my brain  but now it s too fucking late  i don t have the time or money to pursue that now   i hope to end it soon     that is what i wrote yesterday but didn t post  i m genuinely terrified by these delusions of hopelessness that keep coming more frequently  afraid of what i ll do   anxiety has forced me to repeatedly smash my head against the wall and the older i get the more humiliating it gets  my ego is on the verge of collapse   if i m around family  they ll usually say something that sends me into a spiral  if i isolate that s usually no better   i m in a moment of clarity but i don t know what to do with it ,1

t3_dkayd3,will17cart,i don t know what to think,over the last year seemingly i ve had this feeling getting stronger and stronger that i just don t feel anything good anymore  when i m with my friends and family i m normally trying to be the clown nd have loads of fun and crack jokes but the second i m left alone i just feel empty  it s like  switch as i say bye to my friend and they get if the bus i m laughing and smiling  the bus leaves the stop and then i just fell empty  i don t feel happy but i don t feel sad  i just feel lethargic at first and then the more i think the further i slip into thinking about how there is no reason to do anything  then i think there s no reason to live  by the time i get to my stop i feel terrible  normally someone s waiting for me and they can see me on the bus but if i m at home i ll just lie there  and i know this is nothing compared to the majority of people considering suicide but when the things you used to like and enjoy now mean nothing to you and you no longer feel happy it does pop into my head   i ve thought about telling someone but i just know it s going to take to long  last time i went to the doctor s about feeling sad it took months to even get half way to taking about it  i ve considered phoning a suicide hotline but i don t want to waste there time for some one who really needs it   in conclusion im just unhappy  unhappy with life and my lack of feeling and care  i don t even know why i m writing this  it feels like a waste of time when i think about it but when i think further what the hell am i going to do instead of writing this  sit in the dark and feel like crap ,1

t3_dllswk,whatsthepoint98747,what s the point,i m sorry if this isn t the place but i kinda need to vent  i m a loner with very probably social anxiety  today it s the third time my so called  friends  betrayed me  since the end of my summer vacation things we re decent here and there  with a few exception  yesterday i was actually happy playing some stupid video games  but what s the point  no matter how much i do i m always gonna get myself fucked  or others will fuck me and then i get depressed like for a few days and then kinda happy it becomes a fucking vicious cycle  i can be happy for a few days til my life gets on the shit side again  i can barely motivate myself to study at this point  sometimes i wonder why don t i just go to my kitchen and get a knife and stick it on my throat  even if i don t kill myself during my school time i m probably gonna jump in front of bus in a few years  fuck ,1
t3_dkxpqp,MarineRevenge,realizing my life is going to be very lonely  kind of deciding i want out ,not using a throw away because i just don t care     i fantasize about killing myself almost every day  i have been fantasizing about doing so for the last   hours straight  unable to sleep    amp  x   b   i have been unhappy for so long  i regret so many of the choices i made as a teenager young adult  i had a shitty upbringing which can t necessarily be blamed but i feel like it contributed to my negativity and how i handled my situations growing up  my mother would constantly take out her rage and bitterness against my father for their divorce on me  the phrase  you re just like your father  is burned into my memory forever  she d rant about what an embarrassment i was to her friends and co workers anytime i screwed up and would hound me relentlessly   i used to think my father cared a lot more because he was more laid back and didn t scream at me when things were bad  but being full grown i realize neither parent put      effort into it  i have almost zero relationship with most of my immediate family  everyone is an hour drive or more away and even when i get there the vibe is always like  when is one of us going to leave    i feel like such a burden on my father and my mother is desperately trying to compensate for the years of emotional and verbal abuse now that i m an adult but it really just feels like so little    amp  x   b   in high school i made friends with the people who like to party  did a lot of underage drinking and pot smoking  i was a rebellious angsty youth and i pushed basically everyone away from me who wasn t in my party circle  come graduation i have   friends in my graduating class who both cut ties with me and became meth junkies  now i have   friend left who was a couple years older than me but the relationship is like         im always driving to see him     min trip   always going out of my way to work around his schedule and i feel so undervalued    amp  x   b   so i have no friends from high school  a poor relationship at best with my parents and a non existent one with my siblings  which is why they weren t even mentioned     amp  x   b   i do have a girlfriend that i have been with for a long time    years     she is older than me by about    years and that has created its own set of issues  she has two sons who are adult age   yes she got pregnant very early in life   not a fact i love but something that can t be changed  these two sons can t stand me  the oldest believes i am a huge loser and am holding his mother back because i have a chronic illness  ulcerative colitis  sister disease to chrohn s disease if you re familiar with that  and don t make a significant amount of money due to my poor health and inability to hold tougher jobs  her other son just doesn t like my personality and over a year ago he told me more than once  fuck you  and that  i should just kill myself   these incidents are months old and they have never apologized  this stings for two reasons  the most obvious is that its like great  more people who just fucking can t stand me  but the worst of the situation is that i love this woman and wish so much that we could have a child together  but her ex husband forced her to get her tubes tied and so if i stay in  relationship with the only person on the planet who has ever fully respected me  i can never be a father to my own child and the kids she already has hate my guts and encourage me to kill myself  acknowledge fully what they have done  and refuse to apologize or make amends  i ve tried so hard to get an apology for these verbal abuses because they eat away at me  but they refuse  in the back of my mind  i know that people refuse to apologize when they feel they have done nothing wrong  so maybe they are right  maybe i am a loser  maybe i am holding my girlfriend back and maybe suicide is the right call for me    amp  x   b   tonight i was invited to attend someones   th birthday bash at a restaurant  a guy i ve known a couple years  i thought great  maybe this will be a fun social event  finally  i ve been waiting for a chance to branch out  i attend with my girlfriend  i have a couple of   minute conversations with a few people i d met previously through the birthday man  but before long we re sitting at the bar talking to each other and nobody is showing any interest in talking to us  we even sat down near the birthday man himself to be near the center of the action but somehow peoples backs were always facing us  then we tried to initiate conversation and were shut down  it was clear we weren t wanted  or at least not appreciated    amp  x   b   it was in this moment that i realized how alone i am       i m    and i have    real  friend where i put in    ths of the effort to maintain said friendship       the relationship im in is one of the most stressful situations of my entire life because the desire want to be a father is so strong but its not possible considering the technical side and the kids she does have fucking hate me and want me out of her their lives      i was an unlikable shit growing up and have only myself to blame for being isolated     my family relationship is quite poor  i have no strong bonds or trust with anyone  i could never open up about this to any of my family    amp  x   b   and finally  in this horribly long winded terribly formatted post  i have developed a xanax addiction lately to cope with the stress and depression i feel but the smaller doses i was taking are slowly starting to not work the same and i feel like i m headed down a path of serious abuse and then suicide     amp  x   b   i publicly apologized on facebook to all my previous classmates and acquaintances tonight after not using the site for years  for being such a burden on everyone growing up  i hate myself and my life  i made so many terrible decisions  i just want to end my life  i don t know if i will ever be happy ,1
t3_dlnljk,zefylum,about me  lol,growing up i was good at ignoring issues  negative feeling and thoughts  yeah i would get upset sad every once in a while but i wouldn t let it get to me that much  i had a very stoic approach to things and i only cared about having a good time but as i got older everything seemed temporary and meaningless  even family friends that were once very close to me are now nothing but people i hang out waste time with   nothing interests me anymore and the only thing that is keeping me going is my mom  i don t want to disappoint her needless to say i don t want to be selfish and drop out of university   i know this is a very confusing post but i feel like i had some signs of depression early on in life but i never cared enough to look into it because i don t want to be a burden and add another thing to a list of things my mom has to worry about  as you can tell by now my father isn t a part of my life and i think it will stay that way for a long time   my parents finalized their divorce this january which has been an ongoing case since      and only recently did i start to notice how resentful i am towards him  and towards myself for not being able to support my mom   i d like to go to a therapist but i don t want to come across or sound like a privileged  whiny bitch   so i came to pour my thoughts out to the second best thing i could think of and that was reddit ,0
t3_dlsqec,fobnmdqm,i feel trapped in a deadlock,i started getting depressed when i was    and i m    now  for the last three years i am avoiding feeling depressed by basically not doing anything that will give me any stress  if i m not stressful i feel like i can suppress the deppressive feelings that i have  i get on day by day feeling not really terrible anymore most of the time  but nothing is ever really changing and overall my life still feels empty and meaningless  so what is the point really  in order for me to give my life any meaning at all i need to start doing things that will give me stress  which will inevitably slip me right back into depression  i feel like i am just kinda stuck in a life of doing nothing just to not feel absolutely miserable about myself on a daily basis  i m just waiting for something someone to come along in my life that i can really care about  and can give me the motivation to do something with my life  but with the life i m living right now nothing is ever really changing so i m starting to realize that this will probably not just randomly happen ,0
t3_dk9omn,TheSupahDupah,i thought i had recovered,i was feeling better  i had a goal  i had aspirations  i wanted to live  now all those things are just gone   nothing has changed  what am i doing wrong  this is so unfair  everything was  fine  ,1
t3_dlvjgc,cwatson1060,how do i know i was truly laughing ,i m confused  i laugh in some classes in school or sometimes smile but i can t tell if i was really laughing or smiling or was it because i was nervous  i try to remember what i was feeling but i can t remember or don t remember feeling anything  can anyone clear this up for me ,0
t3_dlt2fh,NotThatImportantuwu,i m not really sure why i try anymore,i m an artist  or at least i like to imagine i m one  and i like to make beautiful things  or at least i try to  when i see the end product of my project i feel this giddy high and it s almost like i m loved by my own art  i get so happy i could dance and i cannot stop looking at my work  it just looks so perfect   and then the high ends   i take a good look at the picture and i notice the legs are a tad asymmetrical or the eyes don t look quite right  noticing the flaws can be a bit disheartening  so to cancel that feeling out  i start a new project  it takes forever to decide the concept but then i ve got it  and the way i picture it is so lovely my hands are aching to create it  and i do   once again  i get that high only this time it doesn t last nearly as long as the first  but the low doesn t rush to dissipate  in fact  this low sinks deeper than before  i look over the project and the amount of errors i see takes a massive blow to my self confidence  i thought i had it this time  i thought this time i d create something beautiful  something i d never have to look back at and see blemish after blemish and my own lack of competence  if you can t tell  this shit hurts  i think about trying to create again  but it s a part of an unchanging process and i can t do it again  not today  so i stop and go to bed  knowing tomorrow i have two choices  to give up or to repeat it all again   i m tired of feeling this way so i try something new  be it medicine or a new habit  it all seems great for the first week or even month  but then i m back    often feeling worse  because that hope i started out with to get better or improve has been killed off  now i m stuck with my problems  without hope  i know i can keep trying to find what works but honestly i m getting tired of fuckin repeating it all  be it art or attempting   and failing  to not feel like i want to die        i can t do it anymore  i don t want to  the common denominator of all my problems is me and nothing seems to be changing that   i m tired of repeating it all  i m just so sad  i don t want to live like this anymore  i just want to be on my own and stable for once ,0

t3_dlnqnn,WiccaWhat6,my birthday is in a few days,usually halloween is my favorite time of year  the costumes and the freedom to display whomever you may want to be  my birthday is a few days before  naturally it s typically an exciting time for me    i know as you get older birthdays can lose their importance  but this isn t it    i wish i could skip it  just act like my birthday doesn t exist and it s only halloween  the whole day embodies what i feel on a daily basis  i can t seem to explain it verbally in a way that feels satisfying  so here i am writing it  in hopes this will give me some relief    i m great when i m fine  people see my value and want me to be useful to them  however  i m just too much  and i need too much  it s almost as if being a real human  i mean with flaws and all isn t expected of me  i need to do better  stop being so sensitive  stop feeling bad  i don t know how  and then guilt overwhelms me for not being okay   consideration is not something i am destined to have  i m not saying no one thinks about me  it s more than that  it s almost as if my role in life is tumble in the riptide so others don t have to  i get trapped between this impulse to give all of me  anything that they need  and this hollow  gradually consuming pain that reminds me of the ways of the world  pain  death  sickness  all the things we aim to avoid but we can t  someone in our realm must experience it and the universe seems to agree it s me ,0
t3_dlanv9,BigGuyEli,unhappy in college,hey everyone  first time posting at this sub  in fact  i haven t really checked this sub out before until recently  i started college about   weeks ago  prior to this i had a pretty interesting experience in high school  a close friend of mine committed suicide in   th grade and as a result i turned my life around  i got fit  committed myself to school more  gained hobbies  and improved upon my social skills a lot  i was in my element senior year and this summer i was friends with everyone  was romantically successful  very fit  and somewhat popular  especially compared to how i d been before   then i went to college  at first it wasn t so bad  it was certainly tough  but i felt like i could get things under control  however  it s felt as though things are slipping from my grasp  i have little to no desire to see the friends i ve made here  i procrastinate my work until the last moment because i just lay in my bed exhausted  i find it hard to sleep  worrying about various things  i am overeating a ton because i am stressed and not working out enough because i lack the energy to go do so  parties are exhausting  i have no sex drive  when i went home  i was the happiest i ve been in a while  but going back  it s become worse  my parents tell me i just need will power to stop stress eating  but i can t seem to muster any  i am tired all the time  it seems as though i never get a good nights sleep  but that is all i seem to do  aside from work  i feel like i m a fake  that i don t actually have depression  but life seems a bit like a bland  haze and it makes me so unhappy  especially compared to what i had before  does anyone have any advice suggestions on what to do  i feel like i need help ,0
t3_dlhmgy,AusomeTerry,getting appropriate help without being taken away from the only things that help ,hi  as you may have guessed by the choice of subreddit  i am suicidal  not currently actively seeking ways to die  but i have been recently  as recently as friday evening  i m very lucky  i have a loving husband  two wonderful children  one is nearly an adult and the other is a bit younger  primary school aged   i even have friends  two close friends who are lovely  and family who try their best  my parents love us even though they don t get things right all the time  and i have a loving sister and brother   but my physical health is very bad  i have a condition that means eating causes pain and sickness  i have constant joint pain and constant nausea  i can barely eat anymore  what i can eat is very bland  no fibre  no fat and no meat  i don t mind being vegan  but i can t even eat vegetables or fruits   i have mild organ issues observation checks with my heart  liver  kidneys etc  i struggle every moment of every day with unbearable symptoms   i m autistic  and i have ptsd and anxiety and depression  obviously    i so don t want to hurt anyone  but i don t want to live in this pain and suffering anymore  every time a doctor promises to try and help me with something  it doesn t work and my health continues to get worse anyway  or they don t do it and i get forgotten again   i m in group psychotherapy  it s been very helpful  but it s limited  nothing can fix my body  it just keeps getting worse   the thing is  i want to be honest with everyone about how suicidal i am  especially group the psychotherapists  but i am terrified their answer would be to lock me up in a mental health ward hospital unit   taking me away from my children and husband would take away my only anchors  i would die  i couldn t cope away from them  and my home is the only place in the world i can relax at all   i was recently stuck in hospital for a couple of months because my digestive system tried to kill me again  it made me realise that i can t cope away from my family and home  i would deteriorate to the point of no return  they are the only things that are important in this world to me   i just don t know how to tell them that taking me away is a death sentence  but leaving me here is risky too  i am too sick to seek help when it happens  and more worryingly my husband is having to work away for a weekend soon  and then a little longer  i will be alone at times  i m so glad to get some space to be quiet  but also so anxious that being alone will make me get super stressed out or really really sick   any useful advice would be so gratefully received   i ve lived with suicidal thoughts for as long as i can remember  when i was    i used to try and suffocate myself  and steam burn my hands while making others tea  this isn t new  i should never have been allowed to have children  that way i couldn t hurt them ,1

t3_dkg73l,What_Hump77,not sure what to do now,tl dr  it appears that i don t have as much control as i thought over dying by suicide  how do i reconcile my desire to be honest with    getting professional help     not being able to promise i won t kill myself  and    avoiding the er   hospitalization     amp  x   b   i m looking for advice  understanding  or support from anyone who wants to give it  here goes   i m an almost    year old woman and have dealt with depression on and off most of my life  i m not that attached to life and don t see myself ever being glad to be alive in the future  however  i have obligations that make staying alive for a few more years the right thing to do  i started to slip into a really bad episode a few months ago  about one month ago  i went back on the medication that helped me last time i was really suicidal  but it doesn t seem to be helping that much   some of the worst times are when i m hit by these waves of something extra  something like terror  panic   i don t know  it s like i m choking on air when i m trying to breathe  similar to the feeling i d get if i were looking down off a cliff  i have a fear of heights   terrified and wanting to move away  except instead of feeling that way about staring off a cliff  i feel it about just being alive  i feel driven to get away from the source of these feelings   me being alive   and start getting a bit frantic  looking for a way out    during these times  i ve always been able to keep at least a weak grasp on reality and hold on to something that keeps me from taking any action    this changed last week  and i slipped a bit further  i was trying to calm down by taking some deep breaths and looked up and immediately thought of hanging myself off of the object attached to the wall  i knew that wouldn t work because it wouldn t support my weight  i walked out of that room and sat down in another  then  within       minutes  i d found a way that would work and had gotten everything set up  i paused before taking action to do a final mental run through and realized this was a horrible idea  i was likely to automatically panic and try to reverse course but be unable to do so  i didn t feel bad enough to be okay with dying like this    i think there s a decent chance i would have gone through with it if    i was feeling significantly worse  or    i d been fixated on a different method that would result in a more acceptable death    the thing that bothers me about the above incident is that it feels like i didn t really get to make the decision on whether or not to die  i was acting as though i d already made the decision  but i don t remember even thinking about it  i didn t have a chance to make the choice   i guess i feel even less in control than i did before  also  honesty has always been very important to me and i don t know what to do now because    i want medication     i don t think i can honestly promise to not kill myself  and    i don t want to go to the er or be locked in a hospital  i already feel like i was dishonest the other day with the doctor prescribing my medication because i mentioned suicidal thoughts  but not the hanging incident  and ended up agreeing to go to the er if i thought i might act on the thoughts    i don t want anyone who has tried to help me to feel bad or to face any trouble because of me    amp  x   b   therapy  i might consider it when i m less suicidal  i saw a therapist last time i was really suicidal and for a while afterwards  he played a major role in keeping me alive  i don t want to put someone through that again  though  plus  i m afraid of being locked up this time    amp  x   b      i made one sort of attempt years ago but it was not during one of these driven to escape episodes  it was almost perfect   peaceful death and wouldn t have looked like a suicide  i crawled out before i passed out after realizing that somebody was going to be held responsible for my death ,1
t3_dlk62v,DumbPoorHeart,being alone isn t always a choice ,i wish i didn t have to reach out to people to talk or to hang out  why can t anyone actually care and reach out to me  they have no right to feel sad when i die or when i hurt myself  but then again how would they even know what s going on  some people are constantly getting texts or whatnot from people and then there is me  nobody wants me  not even me myself ,0

t3_dl8ypm,TR2574838,i can t help but to be jealous of other people s success ,it really makes me depressed when i see that other people are doing the things i wish i could do  i haven t been able to do simple tasks lately so when i see people that do amazing  cool things i just can t help but to be jealous  i wish i was in a good state of mind to do things  i wish i could get up out of bed and be motivated  i wish i could take my eyes away from my phone so i could do something productive  but every thing is such a chore    whenever i see someone who is praised for being funny  smart  talented or athletic i just wish i was them  i wish i could be amazing too  i wish i could learn things and not get confused  i wish i could come up with a joke that makes people laugh  i wish i was great at sports or singing  but i can t do anything     i just wish i was amazing as everyone else ,0
t3_dlob5e,GelatinGhost,anyone feel having suicide as an option saps your motivation ,i feel like part of my problem is that i ve never ruled out suicide as an option  when i m on my worst days  my motivation to get better is sapped even further by the thought that doing all the necessary work would be pointless if i kill myself anyways  additionally  i have a habit of looking up studies about happiness and such in order to gauge the pros and cons of living vs dying  sometimes continuing living seems like more of a gamble than just ending it  but i think this constant mental tug of war heavily contributes to my depression   sometimes i wish i could flip a switch that would make suicide impossible no matter how i feel in the future  so that i have no choice but to do my best making life worthwhile ,0
t3_dlfbt6,Kwaad_Naas,i m broken,i feel more broken today than ever before  i lost everything and gave up everything to move to a place where i could atleast sleep under a roof    i lost my job but i still have the most loveable woman that i could ever ask for  but today my depression is getting me  i dont have the funds to afford medical help and continue my medication intake and i dont have the funds to see her im scared i will lose her  i am scared i am useless to her   i am scared i can t support her enough because of my illness    today i feel more alone than ever before but i still have her  i m not here to ask for financial help  money is the last thing i need to feel better  i know it will get better we all have to know that life is hard and struggling with this illness is the most horrible of things and when it feels everything is going wrong you cant help but feel hopeless but we have to still try and get better we stil have to stand up and fight against our own thoughts   we are only human and emotions can overtake our every thought but anyone that is going through what i am going through today should remember we are there for each other  we are not alone  stay strong   ,0

t3_dkkld3,Hobbit-guy,i haven t been happy  i just wanna end it all,this is hard to write  i feel like it s a tough subject and i haven t been able to say it properly  but it s been at least two months already since i ve been feeling like this  so here it goes   i haven t been happy since the start of the year  sure  i have had a couple of happy moments  but as soon as that ends  i tend to feel miserable again and back to hating myself  i just generally feel without energy and almost never wanna do stuff  but well  i have to  i suffer from depression and anxiety  got to be honest  i think i do  i ve never been diagnosed but i m almost positive i exhibit the symptoms    i guess it all has to do with the fact that i started going to university this year  i graduated high school last year and i really really liked it there  i felt happy the last couple of years  it felt like a home  with my friends  the teachers  it felt like a wonderful place  but now i m in uni  one of the best ones in my country  but i just have never felt happy there  it s not about academic stress  i ve gotten good grades so far and i like the career i m in  art history   but i just don t feel like i belong there  i feel a lot of anxiety  i spend most of my time alone  and i really have trouble getting close to people  since i have social anxiety and i just feel different  as i said before  i like my career  but i don t see a future  i don t think it s going anywhere and i don t feel happy  i used to have long term goals and i used to know where i was headed to  but now i m just doing things by pure inertia and i just can t find myself   i miss the happiness  i miss feeling in a place where i belong  and i ve simply don t see myself feeling any different in the future  this has led me to think about ending my own life because i feel i ve lost myself  i can t find real happiness and i really don t anything right now  i ve talked to some of my closest high school friends  i m not close to my family  so i don t really trust them and i ve never talked about my emotions with them  but it goes always the same  it turns into an awkward situation  they don t what to say  i don t judge them  it s a difficult topic to handle   we say goodbye and then it s never brought up again and it s like it never happened  this has led me to remain more closed and i really don t tell anyone anymore  also  i know all my friends are happy  they have found their place  they have found new people  a career they like even with all the stress  so i simply do not wanna be a burden and take them back  because they have already moved on mostly  i ve been thinking of seeing a therapist or something  but i can t work up the nerve to do so  and i really don t think i would open up so easy to someone i don t trust   i don t really know what to do  i ve also been thinking about dropping out from uni or taking a semester off  but i don t know  i would feel like a deception  my parents have spent a lot of money already  everyone is set in their new life  and i feel like i would be like that kid that doesn t know what to do  because let s be honest  everyone talks about the dropout who couldn t find its place  it s a thing our society does  but even if i take a semester off or something  i don t know what i would do  i would probably end up laying around being sad  and even if i find something new that i like  i m scared it will be art history all over again  something i was sure about and now i m here  sometimes i watch a movie or something and i forget about all of this  but then i think about all of the things i have to do and my life feels like a downside again   killing myself feels like the easier route because i don t want to feel like this  feel this pain anymore  i don t want this horrible uncertainty  i ve thought for at least to months about just ending it all  i haven t done it yet because i m a coward  and because i feel there are some people that would be really hurt  my grandmas  a couple of my friends   i hate myself for feeling this lonely  for not being able to just talk to new people  for not being able to feel happy  i just hate me and have been thinking about harming myself  just ending it   i m sorry if my writing is all over the place  i m having a crisis at  am and i m not a native speaker ,1
t3_dl6i7l,InsanityIsBlissful,are suicidal thoughts supposed to turn into thoughts of murder ,i ve had suicidal thoughts since i was    i was bullied for years as a child and had many death threats thrown at me between ages   and    which really messed me up  someone once tried to kill me with a brick but my mother luckely found me before anything happened and he ran away  the other times i ve had fights with other people as a child i would threaten them with very violent words such as cutting their throats and various other fucked up things  there were a few occasions where i would tell them to meet me somewhere for a  fight  which i would bring a knife to but never did anyone show   i m now in my early   s  i m at uni  i want to make something for myself but i can t escape these feelings  i literally do not have a break in the day where i don t think about suicide  now it s getting to the point where i just want to go out and kill someone  the next fucker to say something about the way i look when i m walking outside trying to mind my own business  strangers don t think about who they re saying these things to  what they re going through or what they are capable of   so i just have this huge urge to go out there and fucking show some people that they should be careful what they say to people they don t know    these thoughts and feelings of ending someone s life have never been as strong since those days as a child  i don t know what the fuck to do  if i tell a councillor they ll probably throw me in a fucking asylum or some shit   i feel myself slipping into darkness  and i don t know how close i am to embracing it ,1
t3_dleiq1,heycoolkidz,maybe just want people to know i want help but i don t think it ll make a difference,what the title says  even if i ended up in a hospital and everyone knew i was seriously suicidal  they d probably think of me and treat me the same way  no sense in calls for help if people don t care  i have family visiting now for the next week and half  i don t want to do it while they re here in case i live so i ll do it once they re gone ,1
t3_dldxnz,victini0510,a much needed vent ,i don t know what the fuck i m doing  i go to school  in college  failing at math and english  no matter how hard i try  still can t raise my grades to passing  doing pretty well in art history but only because the class is stupidly easy   got two jobs recently  one at school and one at target  haven t started the school one since it requires finger printing  other income is financial aid  but i wouldn t doubt that i have to give it back after how poorly i m doing    living with my grandpa  aunt  uncle  and cousin  they are incredibly toxic  to the point where i just can t be home most of the time  i honestly think my ridiculously toxic family is to blame for how ongoing and severe my depression is on top of clinical stuff  i live in near constant anger  frustration  and misery  maybe i m blaming my family too much but prior to living here  my depression was totally manageable with an antidepressant  and now it does absolutely nothing  i can t focus on school or homework because i m either so drained mentally because of them or i m busy with work or trying to move out   i ve pushed away a lot of people i shouldn t have and i m so insanely lonely  tried a couple dating apps to see if maybe that would help but all it did was just bring down my already precarious confidence and self worth   i know i ve got stuff going for me but it feels like i m drowning and there s nobody else there  i almost never cry but i m on the verge of tears seemingly every day  i m normally a pretty resilient person but everything just destroys me every day  so much stress and worry about what i m going to eat  if my family is going to kick me out  if i m going to have to give back financial aid  if i m going to pass my classes  all with support from max   internet friends i speak to once or twice a week   i ve tried setting up therapy appointments but after the  th one being unable to  i gave up  i know i should keep trying but  like the dating apps  it just slowly breaks me down   my only goal is to get a steady income and to get away from my family  all they do is take my money and drive me further down the hole of depression  if i can just make it on my own i think i can work at fixing the small problems  work at making school a success and not the failure it s been the last   semesters  i just need to get out and away from my family before i jump in front of a train   anyways i m gonna go to bed now because i have to be up in   hours for work  goodnight reddit ,0

t3_dlum2f,everyones_dad1276,i ve just stopped going to funerals,so to preface this like  i m a recovering addict so most of my friends are also recovering addicts  but the nature of the disease is that a lot of us relapse at least a couple times  well unfortunately sometimes when a person i know relapses it results in them dying  especially if they go straight back to shooting heroin after being clean for so long  i just got clean in may but like since      i ve had to bury    people  that s fucked up man  some of them have just been people i ve kinda just talked with a little bit not too much  people i ve seen around in meetings but not had conversations with  that one really weird person who seems to be at the dope mans house every time you cop  some junkies i shared my smack with once  but it s also been people in my sponsee family  it s been blood relatives  best friends  and ex fianc   and ex girlfriend  people i ve gone to rehab with  it s fucking depressing man  in the last week   people i knew personally died  it s like i wish i would still go to the funerals but i ve gone to so many in the last   or so years that i m just numb to them  when i was in rehab in july i found out from my counselor that a guy who was there my first week was already dead  he was the first guy i talked to there  he was my roommate  he gave me cigarettes until i got some in the mail  and then   weeks later he s back on the streets and found dead with a needle in his arm  i just can t bear to go to more funerals  it s sickening how these people are just dropping like flies  most of them i didn t even get to say a goodbye to,0
t3_dlti9j,RevengeAbe,nobody special ,i don t know why i m typing this but i don t know what else to do  i ve felt worthless for over a while now i think it started when i was about nine  i could go into details but i don t think it s important  to get to the point i want to just not exist  i know somethings wrong with me  i don t know if i m just overly sensitive  depressed  bipolar or what but i m rarely happy and i m always down and have this thing about me where everyone leaves my life one way or another  i came to the conclusion that i m toxic or boring or something s seriously wrong with me because i have nobody and have nothing to live for which i guess is selfish  i ve tried getting help but whenever i used to reach out for help i d get the worst responses  the first time i asked for help was in middle school when i asked my mother if she could help me and that i was feeling really sad and stressed and she said that everything gets better and i just had to get through that time   th grade was a lot for me because a lot of events happened that just impacted my entire life and mindset and views on the world  i started to cut myself because i didn t know what else to do and then i went to school with cuts on my forearm and someone saw it and told me i was an attention whore  he said  you re such an attention whore if you really wanted to kill your self try vertical that should do it   so i nodded my head and said thanks  i went home and slit my wrist with a   inch incision  going down  my arm and i remember being on the floor home alone screaming because it hurt so fucking bad  i was getting mad because i wasn t dying it just fucking hurt and i wanted it to stop  so i got the knife and stabbed my arm and that s all i remember  i woke up in the hospital    all i could think was i m such a failure at life that i cant even kill myself right  then i came tie the realization that someone must ve taken me to the hospital  later i found out it was my mother who found me and took me to the hospital  i immediately started crying when my mom came into my room i was apologizing and she just didn t say anything  i felt so shitty because i was selfish    it was wrong of me but i didn t care at the time  after my mom saw me the doctors came back in with policemen and i saw my arms and they were handcuffed to the bed  they then took me to loma linda where i was put on a      and stripped my mother of all her rights for   days  they made me strip    and i don t want to go into detail because i m still not over it  it was demeaning and i ve never felt so numb  gone  it changed me forever  i was emasculated no longer did i feel like a man or boy just nothing  i felt embarrassed then nothing just like that  then was i really sure i wanted to die  i hated that place and still do  the people there were rude and mean and made me feel crappy  i remember lying so i could get out of that place because i wanted to leave so bad  when i finally was let go my mom took me home and when we got home she didn t speak to me  not one word  afterwards my mother the next morning came to me before i left for school  looked me in the eye and said  if i see that shit again on your arm i ll do it myself but make sure you don t live this time   at that moment i do feel like i lost everyone in my life that was it for me  i didn t try again because i was scared of failing and doing all that again  as time went on i still tried getting help  i thought i was getting better freshman year in high school  i was on the football team made some new friends and was doing good in school with straight a s  it s like whenever i think i m happy or okay something bad always happens  it s like i can t ever be happy  i remember asking my mom for help and she would just tell me that things would get better like she was in denial or she d say it s puberty and hormones which got me mad at the time so i said okay and went to my room  i asked again sophomore year for help and she said no  that it d be on my record and mess up my future  as time passed and the older i got  the worst my life got  junior year after actually begging on my knees for help my mom called me pathetic and said that she d get me a counselor  i saw progress  she taught me about impossible people and how to deal with my depression and ptsd and social anxiety etc  i noticed my mom struggling with payments and her job and providing for the family and i have   younger siblings  i knew it was the counselor that was taking the money  so i went into the office on my next appointment and said i m fine  that i was cured and lied my ass off  i said the nightmares stopped  i was happy and content and wouldn t waste time on negativity or the past etc  she then asked me if i was sure and i smiled and said yes i m positive  she discharged me and never saw me again  i regretted doing that because i was slowly going back into my life and when i tried to read those stupid papers that would  help me  or write my thoughts down or preform any of the techniques i was taught they just didn t work  it s like it was all false  i sucked it up though because i had too  i was the only other somewhat grown up in the house  my dad wasn t in the picture and i did it for my siblings  i remember fighting a lot  i got suspended twice and would lose a lot of friends or whatever they were because i pushed them away  i could tell i annoyed them with my issues and problems and never wanted to speak on it  i remember them always telling me i was sad and always in a bad mood and never happy  i made it through the year  but then hit my senior year which i thought would be better  my mother is phenomenal and amazing but she isn t good with me when it comes to emotion  she doesn t get my mentality i couldn t ever talk to her about my issues because she d call me a bitch or pathetic or useless and that only i can change the way i feel although i didn t know how to go about it  i hate waking up every morning just wanting to die and stop existing  i told my mother to just put me on medication  anti depressants but she refused  i even told her i d pay for it but she said no that when i turn    then i can whatever i want and denied me help again  she claimed it was hormones and that i m just going through a phase and i remember being mad because i ve felt this way since  th grade just it got worse  this is my senior year    i don t know what it is but any little thing can kill me completely  i just stop functioning and go into this dark place and don t want to move or do anything  oh yeah i forgot to mention i lost my motivation for everything and this year i quit varsity football and ditched school multiple times which i know is wrong but i couldn t be at that school with those people  fake people who talk shit about everyone and teachers acting like they care and people you ll never see again and the heart aches all of it  i can t do it  i don t know why i do some of the things i do but i guess i just stopped caring so recently i changed a lot  i told my mother i wanted to die and she called me selfish and i agreed with her saying that i probably was but i no longer cared  i gave up on myself a while ago i m just to scared to go through with it because knowing me i ll probably fail  the sad thing is that s the only reason i haven t tried again  after i told my mother that i wanted to kill myself she told me i was a waste of life and it fed something  it was like everything bad happening in my life all the insults and failures and misery just fed me like it was fuel for a fire  my grandmother on my dads side was a jehovahs witness  and my dad was christian my mother being catholic baptizing me as a catholic  i always did believe in god but recently stopped believing  i refuse to believe there s a god so irresponsible to make a shitty human race where the vast majority of the population is this bad  i don t want to bring religion into this i just know that this was one of the other drastic changes that have occurred  well i think i ll leave it here  i skipped a lot of things but this could be a summary of some parts of my life  i might write more just depends i guess if you read all of this thank you i hope you re doing better than i am ,0

t3_dl7x0j,Capricia_,should i break up with the guy i love because of depression ,i love this guy so much but me being depressed makes him sad and i hate seeing him sad whenever i am having anxiety attacks  he helped me alot  i remember the time whereas i couldn t think straight anymore and just one call away he was there to save me  he was with me the entire time  but me being like this i think it has affected him alot  i do think he deserve someone who is better and gives stress free  i want him to be loved because he deserves it    the way i am right now  i don t think he deserves to be someone who is like me who is sad all the freaking time  i love him so much that i am willing to give him up and let him find someone way better  he doesn t want to leave me because he wants me and he loves me but i m afraid he is only saying that because i am his first girlfriend and he doesn t have anyone to compare with   i love him so much  but my depression is killing me  it s killing our relationship  i have already discussed this with my bf but he refuses  he just doesn t get how my depression would affect him  i don t think keeping him with my state of mind would help the both of us  i just wish he realizes this and knows that i am not breaking up with him because i stop loving him  i am breaking up because i love him alot ,0

t3_dldv9z,miserablesummer1,i feel like i m in a nightmare   ,i was severely depressed for about   years  severely  suicidal at points  dealt terribly with dissociation and derealisation to the point i could barely function  i was in such a dark place  my memory and thought process is still fucked up to this day because of it    at the beginning of last year  i started pulling myself out of it somehow  it felt miraculous almost  things in my life started falling in place  i got out of a toxic relationship and met someone new  everything felt too good to be true  i felt peace for a few months    then out of nowhere  i get a simple uti and am out on antibiotics  those antibiotics don t work and i end up being put on   rounds of antibiotics in all  after that  my health declined terribly  i developed constant pain  bladder issues  and severe constipation  i was a normal healthy    year old woman a few months ago  now my body has me in constant misery  it s just so hard to deal with  so much guilt for not helping myself when i had depression    in some sick way  maybe from being scarred as a child in a southern baptist church  but i feel like this is god s punishment for me not helping myself or something  or sometimes i even think it s because i slept casually with someone and this is my punishment  which i know is not true and is a fucked up way to think  idk just feeling so much guilt and it just hurts so much    please appreciate not being in physical pain if you re lucky enough not to be  i wish all i was dealing with was depression now  it s so hard to feel pain constantly ,0
t3_dl6obx,jessesaxophone,i had a good day for the first time in months,for the last   or   months  i have been on antidepressant after antidepressant and none of them worked  in fact  a good portion of them made my depression and anxiety exponentially worse  panic attacks  a lack of sleep  and complete numbness ensued  i was the most suicidal i had ever been and seriously considered dropping out of school    but i kept going  the only reason i did was because the few people i knew would miss me wouldn t be able to handle my death  i couldn t do that to them  i didn t have the courage to betray them    for the past couple weeks  i have been on a new medicine that seems to be having a positive effect on me  my depression has been fairly neutral  and my anxiety hasn t been too severe either  it s honestly been a breath of fresh air not dreading getting out of bed in the morning    today was even more different  a better kind of different  i woke up and felt   good  a good that i hadn t woke up feeling in years  a genuine excitement for the day  i drank my coffee and it tasted better than it normally did  i played music and danced around my room while i got dressed rather than the usual dragging myself around my room and throwing on a jacket i had worn everyday that week    as i walked through the halls  i felt a newly discovered confidence i didn t know i possessed  my insecurities  weren t hovering over me like a storm cloud  minor inconveniences didn t take a massive chunk out of my day  it was unbelievably relieving    i guess part of me just wanted to share this with someone  i couldn t keep it to myself  but another part of me wanted to post it because there s a chance it could help someone  anyone    to anybody reading this that has been suicidal  depressed  losing motivation  etc  please just keep going  if not for anybody else  please just keep going for me  the cliche  it gets better  gets irritating to hear constantly  but it is true    months ago  i didn t imagine this day happening in a million years  but here we are    just please  keep going ,0

t3_dl9y80,-Noctis-Strife-,the imposter syndrome of a mildly depressed psychologist ,it s      am and i just swallowed my first ever anti depressant  it tasted slightly sugary for a moment and then nothing  i have some interesting thoughts running through my head  though  and i thought i might benefit from documenting them   i feel like a bit of a fraud  i even had to  confess  to my gp that i don t suffer from clinical levels of depression  i m not suicidal and i m left with the feeling that i m cheating the system  he just kind of looked at me with a bit of a smile as if to say  i never said you do suffer from clinical depression   it s that old story of  you must be yea dysfunctional in order to complain about it   but i ve never felt justified in complaining  it s only in the last two years that i have sought a regular gp because i unconsciously believed i was not worth the quality level of care which comes from a person you have built rapport with  so i feel like my challenges are not  bad enough  to decide to pursue treatment   this way of thinking talks to me about arbitrary measurement standards rather than valuing what i want  when i yell at my kids  i feel guilty  when i snap at my wife  i feel ashamed  when i zone out  i feel angry at myself  these are the symptoms i would like to see improving  and it s not about whether they meet some idealistic standard of what is  bad enough   but what i would like to get out of seeing them improve  i want to be a more patient  involved  caring  energetic person  and this is a possible means to that end    i feel my mind racing to justify my decision to go on anti depressants  and i have to keep reminding myself that no justification is needed  except that it may be a valuable step in my life  it s so bizarre that i can encourage clients to take this step themselves with no judgement or convoluted decision making process  however  for myself  i need to wade through waist deep resistance to the idea which demands justification from me with every step   i m learning that thoughts  behaviour and emotion  although heavily influenced by each other  do not have to be congruent  i can think one way  feel another  and behave in another yet  and this does not demonstrate dysfunction  it demonstrates flexibility  if i went around believing that these parts of me had to be entirely congruent all the time  that would be rigid  inflexible  and add to my anxiety and depressed mood  it s okay for me to judge myself harshly  we all do  it s okay for me to feel overwhelmed  we all do  it s okay for me to behave in ways radically contrasting these thoughts and emotions   i hope you have a wonderful day ,0

t3_dl5frw,riverfellon,does anyone get depressed right after being happy at small victories and then when trying to reach out and celebrate someway   you get disappointed at stupidest of things  ,its like my sad version of me constantly outweighs the joyous version  thankfully i don t have an evil side afaik  the biggest trigger for my unhappiness is seeing other people who seems to have more fun in a day than i will have in my lifetime  actually i have quite a few fun moments but even then i was overthinking and not completely relishing the moment  a few days ago i went to see the movie  joker  all alone and then i saw all these young couple of my age and i actually noticed this nerdy and snobby girl that all of my college thought was too egotistical to get into relationships  she literally talks about dating only millionaires but here she was having someone with them and here i am all alone  but i do have friends but they have different taste in movies and are raging alcoholics  i just want some one sensitive in my life,0
t3_dlvbpt,TheBoberts,i feel like happiness is a facade most of the time ,i don t know if anyone else feels like this as well  but i do have times where i am genuinely happy  with certain people  and doing certain things  and then at some point the thought pops into my mind that this is just the bridge until i am sad again   it s like everytime i feel happy and loved  it is just a fabrication to distract me from the fact that i ll soon feel at rock bottom again  almost like a tease of what life could feel like everyday if i didn t fuck it up all the time ,0
t3_dlt98p,AgiasTheDon,i have felt nothing but apathy for as long as i can remember,i ve never talked to anyone about this  and i don t really know if i want to  i also don t know if this is the right place for me to be sharing this information  i figured it s my safest bet because i don t have to commit to anything by sharing this with you all  and i can avoid unnecessarily hurting my friends and family    i am    year old male  and for as long as i can remember  i haven t felt much of anything  i have no motivations  i have no desires  every day is a chore because i know there is no end to it  every day i get up to go to my same old part time job  and study for the same old exams i couldn t care less about passing  i ve never had any relationships beyond temporary flings because i know i can never love them the way they deserve  it s not that i literally can t feel any happiness  or even any pain  it s just weaker  it s like my emotions  while not completely gone  are just extremely dulled  any small amount of happiness or pain i feel is fleeting and i simply go back to the status quo    i used to be indifferent to the thought of death  it was easier to live than to find an excuse to kill myself  and deal with the pain i would cause to my family and friends  but now it s just getting tiring  and i don t want to live the rest of my life experiencing this hellish monotony  it s just getting worse as i age  following the parkland shooting  florida  my state   changed the minimum age to purchase a handgun to    years old  if it were not for this  i would ve killed myself already  but then this fucker had to go and ruin everything with his murder fetish  so here i am  for another year    i don t know if i have any right to complain  so many people here suffer real pain  real tragedies  and my biggest problem is that i don t care enough  i don t know if i can change  or if i even want to be  saved   but i just wanted to be honest with someone  anyone  about how i really feel instead of bottling it up and flashing a smile    thank you for providing me with the platform to speak my mind  and thank you to anyone who took the time to read my ramblings here today ,1
t3_dltiqk,Corbin392,life is pointless   ,     my life isn t going very well and haven t been for the past   years  i am currently     i m young  i haven t been telling anyone that i m contemplating suicide  i always have been the kid in school to try to be happy but it never works  constantly people ask me if i m fine  my life is so bad  i am growing up in a decently poor family  we can pay all bill s but no spare money  my dad is self employed  my mom got out of jail last thursday and she didn t text me or call me when she got out  my old friend carder killed himself   months back and i m constantly thinking about joining him  my grandma is dieing rn and i live with her  i was just thinking if like i came home from school and she would be gone  no goodbyes  i can t seem to get people to like me  i smoke pot and drink  i guess that s the only thing that can help me at this point  i have gone through therapy and it didn t help  i live near a bridge  i m thinking on it  idk yet  it is currently       and i have school  i am doing decent but i dont really care at this point  we live to reproduce and die  i m useless ,1
t3_dl5qcn,ProbablyAgnes,i am tired of my life  the situation i am in  and not getting taken seriously, almost half a year ago i lost my driver s license because of a car accident that happened in february  already before losing my license i was on the verge of depression  but that pushed me over the edge  because of my inability to transport myself my education has been put on hold  now my boss i guess you could call him  the guy that is responsible for me as a student  is putting a lot of pressure on me to take a new driver s test so i can get a new license  it is in both of our interests for me to get a new license so i can finish my education  i have spend the last   months calling the police and other authorities having to do with this license to speed up the process and i feel like i have done all i can do  still my boss blames me for making this take so long  when i try explaining my situation he doesn t really listen      i often try talking to friends and family about my situation and i feel like i never get taken seriously  they all just write i of as teenage problems  or they tell me that i could be worse  as you can imagine all of this does not exactly help my mental state    sorry for rambling  i needed a place to vent and i had nowhere else to go,0

t3_dl8vng,kyhall370,an all time low,so i ve always had on and off depressive episodes since high school  but i always told myself it ll get better when i leave home and get to see new people and places  well i m    now and have been all over the country with the navy  really never made life easier for me but it let me go places  and my episodes had gotten worse till i met my now ex girlfriend who was a good reason for me not ending everything  i thought everything was going great i was finally smiling again  i had just gotten promoted and was on my way to pick up an engagement ring but as i called her to give her the great news of my promotion she decided it was the perfect time to break up with me   it s been   months since she left me and i ve spent every day debating whether or not i should just jerk the steering wheel on the highway on my way to work  i m lonely  no one initiates conversations with me or asks if i want to hangout like literally anything to help me get my mind off how sad and pathetic i am  i feel like everything is pointless and not worth putting any effort in  i ve even lost interest in my art and hobbies   i wish i was back in high school where i at least had a handle on my depression ,0

t3_dl8qjw,sucks_to_be_a_duck,     just getting by   scared i ve missed my chance,this is long but i ve got to get this off my chest    here it goes      i was leading an exciting  successful life up till the age of about     i m    now and really scared for my future  i feel like i ve missed my chance to live my full potential  each day i loose a little more faith that i m capable of doing anything anymore  i think i need to give up my dreams  it s like that poem about two paths  where the author takes the one less trodden  well i did the same  and now i m totally fucking lost  with nobody about to ask directions  and even if i did get back to that fork  it would just mean taking the path i had no interest in in the first place  it would be like accepting an early death  the things that made me love life are fading  and i am very scared that in a few years  i ll have nothing but memories   some context   i have been obsessed with storytelling all my life  i ve been working hard to make a career out of it  as a filmmaker  photographer  writer   in my early   s i felt ahead of the curve  living the dream  i saw great things ahead of me  when i was in my early   s i started a community of creatives  and from that a huge number of opportunities opened up for me  i took those opportunities   seeing things and doing things that would sound unbelievable if i shared them all here  i also met a girl and together we chased the sun and the next wild adventure  i went about collecting experiences   around    i sunk my soul into a project that eventually i finished   years later  i was proud and hopeful  but the world didn t receive my film the way i hoped and i felt totally defeated  around the same time i got a job at small company  it was miserable and i was taken advantage of  and that crushed my spirit even further  and then myself and my partner broke up  it was sad but necessary   paradoxically  a loving decision for us both   from then till now  i still had a few adventures  one satisfying project has kept me going in the last few months  but something in me broke  i can no longer write  i can no longer find the will to create  i am self employed but slowly losing any passion in what i am doing  i have stopped believing in myself  i started taking more and more drugs  weeks and months and years are slipping by  i watched many of my friends find  sensible  paths  get married or find their way somehow  i am increasingly lost  increasingly alone  my mind is suffering from abuse of cannabis  my joy of living has festered into bastardised solitude  i have slipped into deep depression   today i don t know if i have the will to go on  i know i must change something  perhaps it is to accept that my dream of telling stories for a living will never come to be  perhaps i need to find a sensible job  and be content with whatever place the world has for me  it feels so wrong and so necessary to admit that i might have failed  i might have to give up  that maybe all those people who doubted me when i was younger and full of fire  were right  that the wild drive i had years ago was just a thing of youth    i have no mentors  my friends are scattered  i work alone for the most part  i think about suicide more often than i care to admit  i cannot write  i do not take photos  i only make advertising videos  the last few years i ve picked myself up from failure so many times  and i don t know how many more set backs i can take  time is falling away from me and yet i am still here  in this cold  quiet room  where the last years have escaped me  i can t seem to get a job  even as a trainee  in the field i truly want to work  i ve set so many plates spinning it is hard to keep track of them all  and they are falling  my hard fought  small business  is suffering from my own indifference  i do not believe in myself anymore  i am in a relationship i feel is doomed to fail  and feel guilty for thinking that   i cannot organise myself  i cannot motivate myself  i cannot wake up in the morning and i cannot sleep at night  i feel like nobody understands me  i feel like friends and family are waiting for me to give up on my crazy dreams and rejoin society as a normal human being    but i am not normal  everything good in my life has come from embracing my will to be and do different  to give up now would mean starting again  somewhere at the bottom  in a world that is now totally alien to me  the pressure of my ruthless independence has become a prison   i ve quit weed  for the second time this year   i m forcing myself away from the dark hole of internet browsing where i lost myself in recent years   i even wrote a few pages today  but i m not sure for what  self employment means i can t stop  or rest  or take stock  without my business failing  i ve looked for jobs and i m willing to take the cut in freedom and pay  to not be so damn alone for a little while  and to be around people who inspire me  but so far i can t get those jobs  i m starting to think i m unlikable to potential employers  i hate advertising yet it s all i do  i want to tell stories that mean something beyond a product   disaster is looming  the little i have today  i could loose  if i don t get my life together  i don t know where to start  or how   thats my story  i don t know if anyone can help  but i just want to put it out there  thanks for reading ,0

t3_dlay35,lovelikedusk,should i be worried about my thoughts ,sorry this is long   tl dr   i get overwhelmed sometimes over seemingly silly things  and internally say to myself that i want to kill myself i should just die  no depression diagnosis  is this how the path to suicide starts  should i seek a diagnosis and should i be worried    i  f  am in my mid twenties  growing up i was never talked to about depression  anxiety  or really any of my feelings  i was very moody around age    basically until now and my parents never really helped me figure out why and instead thought i was just being whiny and  too old  to act how i was  and often blamed my friends and tried to get my school to do something  i never did anything bad besides yell at my parents a lot  i did relatively ok in school  i was also bullied for a few years about my weight  skin  and kind of weird clothes  since then i ve always felt kind of socially awkward with very low self esteem and feel like i m judged everywhere i go  so basically i just grew up thinking something was just seriously wrong with me for being so mad all the time and i was the only one like that  fast forward to college and i had one year where i was not doing well at all  i talked to my parents about seeing a therapist and they really looked at me like i was insane and said  you re not going on medication  and that was that  i ended up seeking a therapist at my school and never told them    now i m a little older and understand how the world works a little better  i see my own therapist  we talk a lot about my continued low self esteem and very obvious anxiety  i always thought anxiety was something  other people had  but it s definitely what i experience and it was just never talked about  one time i did bring up depression with my therapist and she kind of brushed it off because she doesn t like it as a defining term  i really kind of want to see a psychiatrist to know if somethings wrong on a chemical level  the reasons for this post is    whenever i feel like i say something stupid or am causing issues  i really say to myself  i want to kill myself  or  i should just die  and start thinking about ways to do it  but not seriously  last night  this happened and i stared to wonder if this is how a path to suicide really starts and if i should be scared about not addressing my thoughts  i haven t told my therapist in fear of it coming off as just being dramatic  recently i found myself hitting my forehead with my hand after an embarrassing moment  and i did this for a few days  i have no other history of self harm besides binge eating   anyways  i m looking for clarity on what i m feeling  i can get up in the morning but also have daily  i want to die  thoughts   i m wondering if my confusion is due to never being able to name my feelings as a child  and always being yelled at for being upset  what is it really like when you see a psychiatrist  any insight would be helpful ,0

t3_dkusvv,Cibeleee,a never ending slumber in the mountains  a suicide plan ,i just turned     and things have never been easy  i really owe it to the nonchalant friends  the stubborn  stuck in the past family  and the unempathetic lovers  i have been reminded left and right that my wants and needs will never be put above anothers  that my mental illness is a plague  something that makes me so damaged  its irreparable  that i will never be anyone s priority  not my mother s  my father s  my sisters or brother  not a partner  not a life long friend  no ones  i am just a burden  i belong to no one  and i m starting to come to peace with that  and if you argue life is meant to be lived happily and contentedly without the intention of love and connections  that is bullshit  you cant live an amazing life  loving  your pathetic irreparable self    but before i go off on a tangent  i just wanted to state that i ll be disapearing  i will be going to the west coast  i m going to stay in the mountains  where i will be consuming   mg of ativan  and a bottle of whiskey  it s quite pathetic  the life i lived  so i decided i will be using the upwards of      worth of gear i invested in to backpack in the mountains until i can t anymore  i have another      in cash that i will take with me  after my money runs out  i will find myself under the starts  in the cool winter breeze  and sleeping most peacefully ,1
t3_dl5q3d,Optimus_Pitts,the worst part of my depression has officially made it s yearly visit  possible triggers ,despite how unwelcome it is  i m    now and i ve struggled with depression and anxiety since i was about     never fails  once it starts to turn to fall  i hit a bottom  the downside is that in my state  we bounce back and forth from summer to fall for about     months   i ll say this  since i met my wife  my history of self mutilation and suicidal thoughts have significantly decreased  i ve learned to convince myself that i don t hate my life and i don t want to die  i just hate how i feel  that said  having to remind myself that multiple times a day has gotten extremely exhausting   just like every year  i m back to having the negative self talk in my head  dissociating a lot  random outbursts when i m frustrated at myself for not being able to do something and random breakdowns where i cry until i feel numb  food doesn t have a taste  music is just sound  shows on tv are just meaningless pictures  and i m isolating myself because faking the smile and pretending everything is cool takes too much out of me    between always being tired and malnourishment it s affecting my job  my stats have dropped significantly and when my manager has a coaching session with me  it ends with me beating myself up for not being better and crying for       minutes   i guess i m just venting here  if this isn t a good place to do it  please tell me and i ll delete my post   but above everything  i just want to feel like me again  i want life to feel like there s a purpose again  i m not going to do anything to harm myself  but i just don t know how much longer i can handle feeling this way,0

t3_dltopf,AudioKritik_YT,kind of in a shitty place right now and needed to vent a little  kinda need help  not therapy  just someone to talk to,so    a lot of things have gone wrong in the past few months  i kind of don t know where to start with this  so i ll just start and see where it goes      so  a few months ago  i started at a program called job corps  i m currently taking office administration  and that s been going pretty well for me  but  recently  especially today  i ve been feeling like nothing has been going right for me  i feel like nobody ever wants to be around me  and that they all just want to push me away  the few friends i did make here  except one  have all been treating me like shit lately  wether it be making fun of me behind my back  to my face  or just ignoring me  the only time their ever nice to me is when i have something they want  which is generally fuckin money  which i don t have  we get paid less than     every   weeks  its honestly bullshit   the one person i m able to talk to about this stuff is back home now  because he completed the program  i used to be able to talk to my boyfriend about stuff like this  but he s always busy with his own life  i understand that though  except now  i m unable to talk to him altogether  about the only thing i had to talk to him  or my parents was my laptop  but about   weeks ago  i was pushed down the stairs by this jackass  and ended up landing on it  fucking up the screen and a bunch of shit inside it  the center i m at usually refunds students for stuff like that  but apparently  it s only for stuff under a certain price range  and mine was about      over the price range  the worst part about that  is the amount of music projects i lot  almost   years worth  it s not like it mattered anyway  i wasn t an good at it  can t get it fixed either because the center was built on top of a fucking mountain and we have to apply to get off  don t know how i m going to talk to my boyfriend or parents for a while i don t have a phone and repairing the damn thing would be a waste of time because it would just get fucked up anyway  and i don t have the money to fucking replace the damn thing either  having to type this shit on one of the center computers that are super restrictive for no fucking reason  just so i can get some of this shit off my chest  i m just rambling at this point  but i dont really care  i m usually able to deal with this type of stuff  but today was just     fucking shit  for starters  it was pay day today  and they cut my pay in half  of the     we normally get  i only got     so that pissed me off  then  my  roommates  complained about me and they all got switched out of the room  i have no idea what they said about me  because i don t even talk to them  but now i m having to see the center director tomorrow  and i don t know what for  i know i didn t break any rules  so i m not getting terminated  but i still think it s bullshit  honestly  the more i m writng this  the more angry i m getting over how much bullshit has gone on just today alone  i ve just been feeling worthless  and unwanted for a while now  and i honestly was pushed over my breaking point today  sorry for those of you that read this  i m just having a shitty fucking few weeks and need to vent a bit  sorry  i didn t mean for this to turn into such an angry post  i ll probably just leave  noone wants me here anyway ,0

t3_dkiz0a,hiitsover,i ve decided to end my life,hi everyone   i ve been planning on ending my life for a while  just struggled with finding the optimal time  that time  however  is tomorrow  monday  or wednesday at the latest   i ve wasted the last seven years on a business that has now resulted in me owing a considerable sum of money and despite what should be a reasonable resume i seem unable to find suitable employment   for the past seven years i worked extremely hard and ultimately have nothing to show for it  everyone i know either buying homes  travelling or having kids and i have none of these things    my wife will be home late on monday and wednesday so i have the opportunity to kill myself in front of an express train  based on my research  finding an express train is important as it should have a speed that results in death   i am open to other methods of suicide  ideally i would prefer not to involve a train driver  but my research has not found another method that is as accessible ,1

t3_dkgcb4,rassion-isle,hello,this might be long so if you skip over me that s okay  there s a lot of people who need help here        i literally have no idea where to start     wat  hello person reading this  here goes i have a long history of mental illness  so honestly i m not surprised that i came crawling back to a place for help   i ve been hospitalized four times for attempts and suicidal ideation in the past year  but this time i m determined not to go back  im really tired of feeling like i ve let everyone down by trying to escape  i m really tired of acting like i m okay even though i know my medication isn t working  and at this point since i ve been in this position before  i know what comes next         going to the hospital again for help isn t an option  i know i can t just fix everything overnight  these problems didn t get here overnight so i can t fix it by   o clock tomorrow  but these feeing need to leave  i need a medication that works  or this time i really need to succeed in my attempt  because at this point i m not going back to the hospital  it s sad when the nurses know you on a first name basis  i just feel as if maybe i m not meant to get better  that maybe if i try again i should just succeed  and part of me wants help but i ve gotten help before  and i obviously still very much would like to be dead    one of the social workers in the hospital for group would say this   is it that you don t want to live  or is it that you don t want to live like this   i love that  but honestly it feels like it s come to the point where indeed i just don t want to live  and i don t want to go to heaven  i don t want to go to hell or wherever you might believe we go  i just want to be wiped out of existence  if dying is my ticket there  then so be it    i don t know maybe you can help me clear some things and poke holes in places so i can see clearer  because right now my brain is a mess  sorry for the long post  hope you have a good day night  and you are okay too ,1

t3_dkffh1,dissociatingginger,i m high asf and about to get busted for smoking in me mum s basement lmao,so i don t really know what s wrong with me but like i can t stop smoking  and i know that weed isn t physically addictive but i heard that it s psychologically addictive   and lmao i m broke asf bc i don t have any excuses to get money bc i don t have friends or a ride  for going out  so i m relying on the last couple grams i have  thank titty the strain is super fucking strong and it ages really well so bless toto  so i ve only been why tf don t you spell it like ben when it sounds like you re saying ben bc ben   is fucking pissed by this abomination  needing a gram a day but it s been ben    like   weeks and i m starting to need more and more and i m also getting really bad highs  and lol i m probably too into my bad trip to realize how i sound  which is probably stoopid  but my mental health is getting worse like my depression and pmdd and disorder eating and whatevvvva is getting bad and i think that s why my highs are getting worse  lmao bc i got really high right before my last cheer game of the season but instead of having a good game i was stuck in this horrible thought process that everyone was talking behind my back which isn t that far off bc a lot of them do that to each other  and my really close friend on the team wasn t there and so i was alone by myself the entire game and i got even more depressed than i would of soberly ben    anyways idk where i m going with any of this  i m just trying to calm myself down from this horrible fucking trip  my close friend on the team says she seriously thinks i should go to rehab  and a couple other people have said the same  but like it s weed so idk i m afraid if i get any type of help for smoking weed i ll seem really dumb and ik that itself is pretty stupid and childish but like i ve never got to grow up like i had so much abuse during my toddlerism that it just messed with my development like any other kid  human exposed to abuse would be messed up  so that s where most of my anxiety is based upon and that s where  people pleaser  like characteristics stem from  ya know  yk i don t think i need a therapist anymore like i just started to see her and it s super nice and has already helped with my trauma and drama hehe poet who    and i ve only had   appointments but like maybe all i gotta do is keep experiencing bad trips so i can work through them and figure some shit out,1

t3_dkgo7h,ThrowAwayNeedsHelp74,final days,there s always been the question  if today was your last day    what would you do  thinking now  it s focused on involuntary passing    but what about us  the suicidal  i guess it would be different person to person but    do you just want it over asap  or do you want to say or do that one last thing    regrets     i don t know whether i want to tell anyone  let them find me  or simply disappear    off somewhere whats left hopefully wouldn t be found      days to decide   ,1
t3_dl704w,ThrowAway_BenasWest,is it just me ,a lot of time i just can t be asked to talk with people  it s hard to make up conversations when im with someone and i find it soooo mentally exhausting    especially over text  i got a few snaps from people i know that i havent opened for a couple of days  its just so tiring,0

t3_dl5zyb,Abe060318,break ups,some context  i ve been dealing with depression for the last year  amp  a half  amp  moved away from my family   years ago  when ever i m with my family i feel so much better  amp  they push me to do things for myself  my now ex always wanted to help but i don t think he knew how  yesterday i left my boyfriend of two years who i love dearly because i couldn t handle my depression  i moved home with my parents since we were living together  amp  they are happy to have me home as they never much cared for my now ex boyfriend  we split on good terms  amp  will re evaluate things in   months  amp  see how i ve worked on coping with my depression  the entire   hr drive to my parents i couldn t help but want to turn around  i know this split will probably be good in the long run  either make us stronger if we decide to get back together or open new space for new people  but this feels like such a mistake   i guess this post is just a vent to people who understand what depression is  if anyone has gone through something similar  amp  has any words of advice it d be much appreciated ,0

t3_dklin6,Maonsie,just another trans girl,i guess it s finally time to share with the anonymousness of reddit  my story s really not any different from any other story that gets posted here  especially as it relates to being trans  within the past few weeks i ve come to realize that i am what i ve completely passively repressed since  th grade  and it really fucking hurts   i don t really know what to do  and maybe that s the underlying problem  but it s such a massive thing to be afraid  in my brain  i feel that i d gain nothing from therapy  i ve such a jaded view of it  that i m too self aware of how fucked i am that it would just be a joke to try it  that and piling on being a  girl  on top of most likely having bpd and legitimate depression  it would just be a joke to go to therapy   that only makes me think of actually transitioning  and that s when the crying starts  would that i could go back fourteen years to when i was     and not have to go through puberty as a boy  instead  try and transition then  i have zero expectation that if i tried to transition now  i d come out the other side as the girl that i ve built up in my dreams  that i m relegated to spending my life trapped inside this disgusting host body wrecks my core   i have no actual friends  only people who i talk with online  and really  only a couple even can understand at all what it feels like  but in that end it s all meaningless as their words are simply just words spoken hundreds of miles away from people that ultimately i mean very little  it s what all of you are as well  try as you will to argue differently  i ve definitely given up on the notion of finding any sort of intimate relationship  it s my lot in life to be the virgin who cries browsing pornhub  both out of desire to have sex and desire to be attractive enough to be a camgirl  to what extent that springs forward from being a chaste monk i don t know but it just fucking hurts to be ugly and unwanted    i m not particularly good at much of anything  and certainly nothing of any use or value  i suppose my ultimate passions lie in world building  graphic design and  of course  consuming media  but i never get to watch movies or listen to music or game with people  no matter how much i d like  it s always just me at the cinema alone  or reading and drinking coffee alone  and that entirely ridiculous notion of everyone staring at the  loser  by themself eats away at me so much even though i know that no one really cares  and the isolation always knaws at me when i m sat alone in my apartment    i suppose at this point the only thing that i m really living for is star wars for the rest of the year  the mandalorian  fallen order and the rise of skywalker  past that  i don t really want to live to my   th birthday  i m utterly terrified of death  but it s just so  so tiring to continue living like this   congratulations to anyone who actually reads any of this garbage  i just can t process any of this in my own head anymore  i can t shove away these thoughts and repress being trans any longer    but in the end i m just another trans girl trapped in this hell  so how much is that even worth  c ,1
t3_dlsmnb,Anonymousonreddity,so tomorrow is my birthday    ,hello everyone   tomorrow s is my birthday  but i m not happy about it   happiness is an aberration in my life   in high school i thought of ending my life nearly everyday  but i didn t   now i am a graduate student and lately i have been extremely depressed by a number of things that have piled up over the past few months  for starters  i had   friends graduate and move on with their lives this past summer  i really miss seeing them every day  more will leave in the coming year and i wonder if they will remember me  i m not the funniest or interesting person they ve known  but i tried to spend time with them before they left  at the expense of spending time with my family  one of them recently came back and invited some of my friends for drinks   i opened up to this friend about my social awkwardness and the loss that  i felt over the summer   he seemed very supportive and shared similar experiences in his life and how he got over them   so i thought that when he came back he would ve invited me to hang out   instead  i never got an invitation and later i found out that he wanted to hang out with those that he had a deeper connection with  which we didn t have  even though we got lunch before i found this out  i still feel gloomy about not being invited after all that i invested   this past summer   people i knew died  one of my cousins  a middle school high school friend who likely died of drugs  and a welcoming grandmother like figure in my community   there s more  i had a crush on someone in my program  early this year she started inviting me to lunch and other events with her friends  which was a pleasant surprise because i almost always initiated those things  she had rejected me before  but now i thought perhaps she had a change of heart  i didn t focus on asking her whether this was the case because of my past experience and also because i was in a harrowing struggle that i won to remain in my graduate program  i cannot disclose anything about this for fear of retaliation  but someone was trying to get rid of me from my program  that person failed   it seemed that everything with my crush was going well  but after a friend s wedding in late april  she stopped initiating those invitations  even though i continued to invite her to lunch with friends   to make a long story short  i heard recently she s dating one of my good friends who left the program   when i found out about this  i felt devastated  really devastated  i was in a depressed state before this happened  but now it s unimaginably worse  she is a very kind person that grew on me over the years  i feel so stupid and evil for thinking that things were going in the right direction  i feel so disgusted at the thought that i bothered or made her feel uncomfortable  i feel bad that she has to deal with this in her new relationship   my crush told me that we need to take space from each other  when i apologized for placing her in this situation and for any times that i made her feel uncomfortable  she thanked me  that made me feel worried that there were times when i made her feel uncomfortable  so i texted her this question  but she said that my texts were making her feel uncomfortable  with that  i haven t contacted her   weeks and i haven t seen her in nearly a month  i don t have any intention of doing so anytime soon  but this doesn t lessen the worry that i caused her discomfort  it also hurts me socially because i cannot hang out with friends that know her  i m trying to avoid venues where she will show up  negative thoughts like  i want to be turned into roadkill  or  i should receive the death penalty  have come to my mind  i have absolutely no intention of ending my life  but it s been very difficult lately and almost every day i m sobbing  this is excruciating      how can i be happy tomorrow when everything ended up like this   it s like my life is a bad set of cards that i got and i feel like it s time to fold     sorry for the long post ,0
t3_dltd23,existentialboredom19,there s nothing worse than mental health issues in high school,i can t get anything done  i can t focus  i can t think  i can t do anything  and by law i still have to somehow drag myself to school and pretend to be ok for   god awful hours while i can t learn anything anyways and then go home to not be able to do any assignments or study for anything and just feel like garbage  and there s the constant pressure of needing to get into college and so being entirely defined by the nothing i can do without giving a concern to my mental health  and i can t get out of this hell for another      years  i can t take this anymore  i m burned out and i can t take a break  i m starting to only see one way out  i just can t do this anymore  oh  and being  gifted  is a load of crap  all it gets you is bullied for    years and hopeless social isolation  some gift ,0

t3_dlq23a,BashedByMonkeys,quite close friend colleague of mine committed suicide ,short preface  i myself am an senior    year old medical student  my mentor amp friend was an young ortho trauma surgeon  a bit older than me    children and a wife   this man was like a substitute father to me  sometimes even risking his ar  e  teaching me rather specialized trauma knowledge  amp  allowing to perform some interventions on patients while i am still an student  as well as having time to listen to my life s issues  today through side some side channels i was told that this weekend he had abandoned this world of his own volition     now i seriously think to end it all too   due to my terrible family background  alcoholic  amp  mentally abusive mother  f  k up of an father  i am neurotic  a bit ocd  am plagued by terrible headache which flares up nearly whenever i begin to really stress about something      have nearly no friends   except for one close friend who s living in another country at the moment  truthfully i am terrible at making friends  somehow people of my age tend to stay away from me  have no social contact with my colleagues in my academic group  most of them hate me  because i am rather uptight and have a shi  ty sense of humor   ergo no social life  good at my studies  helping patients  some sports for my personal enjoyment   swimming here and there   i consider myself to be an husk of a human being  performing day to day functions well  eat  study  sh  t  sleep  repeat   as well as appeasing my grandmother  whom raised me  and truthfully is the only person today keeping me on this earth   the only things i feel really inside are emptiness  sadness and loneliness   that is  if i even allow myself have time to think about them   my teacher was way stronger person than i am  he finished gruesome residency  had friends  good sense of humor  was wholesomely terrific human being  and yet he decided to leave his life behind    if such a strong person decided to stop  why on earth should i continue  living as a biological husk of human being is life full of misery ,1
t3_dlg49b,chickenNCmugget,anti depressants are drugs that are able to convince your brain that the world is a nice place   when in reality it isn t ,obviously this doesn t always work  but this is how i feel  i mean  honestly  look at the world  do i even need to write down things that make it an awful place  just turn on the news  which i stopped doing  or remember that in order to be able to live on this planet you have to sell some of your time to do mostly useless jobs for a major corporation that almost always underpays you  yes  there are great jobs  but what does the majority on this planet do  great jobs with great pay and benefits  i don t think so   how can anyone not be sick in this society  but because suicide is a taboo  depressed people like me have to do therapy and take drugs and are just generally forced to stay alive by all means   people say depression makes you see the world in a more negative way than it actually is  but who needs depression for that  you will notice that the world is a generally negative  bad and evil place   except if you re rich and privileged   if you just pay attention   the world is a horrible place  our society turned it into one  people who are healthy are just able to deal with it or ignore it  people who are sick receive drugs and or therapy to make them able to deal with it or ignore it ,0

t3_dltx76,ATypicalScholar,my life is hinged on the success or failure of an application ,hi  i m your typical normie that s shut down every aspect of my life because i don t know if i ll see my next birthday   i ve battled depression and suicidal tendencies for years  about   years   i haven t had a friend since  th grade  i m now    in my second to last semester of college and will be graduating with   bachelors degrees  i lost most of my belongings because i was  dumped and kicked out a year ago and left homeless for a month  she was cheating on me while she was supposedly out with friends  it culminated in her saying she was done and i needed to move out  she expected me out in a hour  so i lost important belongings and even my cats because she called the police and almost had me arrested  she got to keep most of my things except my recording equipment  a chair  and my laptop  i m surviving  but i just feel completely empty  i don t interact with anyone  i don t think i utter a word to a single person in a given week  i talk to myself kinda since i pay rent by doing voice work for advertisers and such  but it doesn t pay very well  i get the flexibility i need out of that work which is nice    but i m generally always alone  i haven t spoken to my family in   years except my brother  but that s gone  my brother was the only contact i had  but he passed away over a year ago  i didn t even get to go to the funeral or know he died until his wife posted it on facebook    i don t have a desire to connect with anyone and i don t worry about dating since it s not worth the emotional pain or effort  i ve mitigated my social network to merely work contacts that i never see in person   my life is hinged on whether i get into graduate school or not  i ve only been passionate about one particular field of study within the discipline of sociology so it s limited the masters programs i have to choose from  if i don t get in    honestly i ll be left with nothing  i m barely making rent  i haven t had medical insurance in over   years  i barely make my car payment and i m just lost   i haven t planned for not getting into graduate school because if i don t i m pretty much done  where i live i could never get a job with my degrees  even if i could i wouldn t want to because i only get enjoyment from researching and conducting studies  everything else i don t have the capacity to do anymore   so my life is hinged on whether i get to continue my pursuit for education and ability to research into my discipline or i crash and burn  i m prepared for both and honestly expect to fail ,0

t3_dlczvx,ILikeMyAnimosity,i need to  vent  and i am posting to reddit to do it ,funny  how i have reached a point in my life where i am posting to reddit  so  to whoever ends up reading this  lets begin  i ve been around here for a couple of months but never said anything  i feel really selfish for posting here now but i feel as if i don t have any other choice   i am at my lowest point in   years  i saw it getting worse and worse over the past month or two  maybe even longer but i didn t act on anything because i never thought i would get this bad  it certainly wasn t a slow decline and was a rapid decent into this  i am posting here because i just need someone to read this   friday  i ended up leaving school early because i just couldn t bring myself to stay i was a broken down mess of a teenage boy  who sat in a toilet for an hour and half in tears  i ve  skipped  school because i feel like shit and i don t even feel safe going  i am extremely demotivated about doing any form of school work and with exams coming up this isn t helping  the thought of going back to school is absolutely destroying me mentally and emotionally  i am struggling to get myself to do even remotely anything that i enjoyed  everything feels so difficult and tough to do  nothing brings me joy and i just sit there not enjoying anything  playing games  talking to friends  reading books and writing  nothing is enjoyable for me anymore  i ve taken to sleeping during the day a massive amount to just escape the emptiness  loneliness and sadness that i feel  yet  i still wake up drained and overly tired as if i haven t slept for days  i barely eat anything or keep myself hydrated correctly   recently  i decided i needed a break from my friendship group  as i was coming home everyday feeling extremely lonely and in pain  in the end  they where affecting me negatively and for the worse and i felt that was also projecting onto them  i explained i needed a break but would still be friends with them all  and they where all supportive of the decision without a question asked as to truly why   although  i feel as if they aren t happy about it and are talking behind my back but that is hopefully my anxiety talking and not the truth   yet  i am now feel extremely guilty and like a traitor to all of them  that i ve somehow just stabbed them in the back and hurt them trying to do right by myself for once  i ended up talking to the one friend who i don t feel lonely and really shitty around and asked them if they wanted to do more together  thankfully  they said yes but i can t help but feel extremely guilty for asking such a question  i have sent them a few other messages trying to explain things and apologise for it  they are super understanding and supportive but my own guilt wants me to keep going and i have to actively force myself away from any form of digital contact with them for a little while  as i feel like an annoying pest  they told me i ain t annoying but i still feel like i am   the worst part about all of this  is that i am once again having suicidal thoughts and relapsed and cut myself   i didn t draw blood or have to clean anything up   i broke down crying when i truly processed what i was doing and went and took a shower that was way to hot  i am stuck up at night for hours just thinking about killing myself or hurting myself  every waking hour i want to die or hurt myself to make it just go away  i feel so worthless and empty  i really want it all to be over right now   ah hell  i m sorry for doing this but i just don t know what else to do right now ,0

t3_dlhp1u,I_got_lost2,telling a friend,sooo  recently i felt really better and very stable  so i ve decided to tell my friend a very mild version of my depression  i did it because i have a feeling that it s about to get worse again  i actually didn t even use the word depression  i just said that there are things a wish i could talk about with someone and that i can t  because i don t want to bother others with it and that s what makes me feel lonely and sad   i consider this person to be my best friend  we know each other from school   and how she reacted   well    she started crying  refused to speak  it took my four bloody hours to convince her   four hours    that she has done nothing wrong  she is a good person  it will get better  that i expressed myself incorrectly  it just sounded bad  i ve told her that she is always there for me and that s what matters    and other beautiful lies  at the end she believed and calmed down   it was so mentally exhausting to find the right words   now i feel like shit  it s worse than before  i can t look at her  we didn t talk about it since then and i have to watch my mouth and pretend more than ever   it just confirmed what i though  i m all alone in this  people don t give a fuck about you    so did anyone else try sharing with a friend  how did it work out for you ,0
t3_dl9fpa,deltaparkIdodeclare,tell me i m not the only one   ,so i m a    year old male  amp  and an elementary school teacher  teaching  th grade  i was diagnosed with depression  amp  ocd before my senior year of college a little less than a year ago   i feel this debilitating frustration with myself that i m not  depressed enough  or  bad enough  to feel as bad as i do or have the thoughts that i have  some days i will smile and laugh on a few occasions and immediately get angry with myself for doing that because it doesn t feel  okay   i ve started to scratch and pinch myself on my right arm to feel as much pain as i can and last night i cut my arm near my wrist with a kitchen knife     i think about suicide sometimes but i don t know how much of it is my ocd and how much is how awful i feel  i hate anything and everything about myself and feel so hopeless and lost  but feel guilty for feeling so bad because my parents spend sooo much    on me to get help and i don t have the bad home life or horrible support system like others  nor does my depression always strike   i pinch  hit  and scratch seemingly all day everyday for every little thing  if i screw up at school  i reach under my shirt and scratch till i feel pain  tell me there s some one else who has this story    i m scared of myself ,0
t3_dklkaq,Ewwbug,had enough of watching everything i love slowly die,bad enough to read horrible headlines about nearly     of all wildlife dying  then a few months ago i read that we have about    years at most to stop our extinction  and the extinction of most species  and  after that      tipping point  my hometown  along with nearly all of the world  will become a desert  i don t want to sit indoors and watch wildfires     days out of the year consume the hills around my house  no more autumn  birds and animals  just fire and smoke  i don t care about the loss of local jobs  even refugees and such  people are a scourge  but the devestation of my home by people who don t want to bother changing   cutting emissions by taking public transportation  buying solar panels  eating vegan   makes me i hate them and myself  i feel like if i really cared i would end my life  no one in my life wants to hear again about how grief stricken i am  they want to talk about their retirement savings or keeping their grades up as if there is a point   i m alone and a burden  protesting and volunteering are brief distractions from these feelings if being forced to watch slow death of everything i love  relationships as well as my home ,1
t3_dlb235,FlyingTentacleMan,video games and the desire to see this one game finally succeed is basically keeping me alive,yeah  basically minecraft and this game called post scriptum are keeping me alive besides the thought of scaring my family and friends  i can t go one day without crying and thinking about people around who live perfect lives with the smarts  charisma  respect  fame  and girls  thinking about them just makes me think i ll never be able to achieve what they re doing  it s not like i can since i have become so lazy to do anything and any obstacle of any kind kills my motivation to do something extra outside of necessary school work   why try when you re bound to fail ,0

t3_dkw3iv,elziion,still alive,three days ago  i would have taken the great jump  nothing was keeping me alive  when i have those suicidal tendencies  important things fade away gradually  goals dreams  passions  studies  work  family friends  slowly  through the years  goals and dreams went away  studies    work     and three days ago  not even my close ones were a reason to keep me alive  why stay alive  when anyways    after a couple of months of crying  i would be lost and forgotten again   i m just another human being     why keep on living  when all i go through is suffering  why not take a look at the void  contemplate it  taste it   that s what i was thinking  looking at the ceiling from my bathroom floor   i felt numb   i have been feeling numb for days  but this time  it was different  i didn t care anymore  nothing mattered to me anymore   my parents were gone on a vacation  i wasn t seeing my friends since a certain time  now  my best friend would text me everyday  but        i just wanted to matter to someone  i was ready to kill myself    but i didn t  i cried  instead  for what felt like hours  i was in so much pain  i didn t stop  i couldn t stop  i haven t cried this much in a long time  the pain was unbearable    i prayed for the first time in forever to any god out there that would just stop this pain  and then  i took a bath  and fell asleep  almost as if i came out like a new person  i woke up and felt    okay  and    slowly  my brain has been restructuring itself and gave me new feelings  a new breath of life   i m not saying i am healed  i m going to be careful with this  but it feels a bit better   hold on  anyone reading this  you can do this ,1

t3_dlrisq,jplew92,permanently in the bleachers,to me  depression is like sitting in the bleachers by yourself and watching everyone else thrive and have fun  i feel like i am reminded on a daily basis of all the things i do not have and can only fantasize about having  a lot of these things are easily obtained for the normal person  a life of mediocrity and loneliness mostly caused by myself  but too afraid to pull the plug entirely because of what it d do to the few loved ones in my life  i keep getting older as we all do and somehow continue to make less money each year  with my depression  i rarely sleep as my mind refuses to shut off  this is causing me to age a lot quicker and become even more less desirable which is scary  all my friends are married with great jobs whereas i am so lucky to get just one date and if i do  i usually blow it  it s an endless cycle of shittiness with no light at the end of the tunnel  just more darkness ,0

t3_dlgcz3,_Anty_,can i get stitched up in a hospital without my parents knowing ,i m underage      and live in germany   i used to cut myself on a daily basis but not very deep  about a year ago it switched to rarely but very deep cuts that need stitches   i kinda know when it s gonna happen  it s just that feeling i have of losing control  in the last few days that feeling came up again and now it won t be long   fyi my therapist knows that and of course she s not happy about it  but she supports me getting stitched up without my parents knowing   so  to my question  does anybody know if there is a way to prevent the hospital from alerting my parents  i know that they generally have to  but i ve heard of people that self harmed and whose parents were not informed   again  i live in germany  so that s important as well    some more info   i ve tried to commit suicide before but currently i m somewhat stable  meaning i wouldn t care if i die  but i won t do it myself  and i ve got a contract with my therapist  she would lose her license to practice and possibly end up in jail if i die from suicide  which is reason enough for me to not do it    the reason why i don t want my parents to be alerted is because they would lose their shit  they wouldn t hurt me physically  but mentally  it happend before and they screamed at me  threatening to throw me out of the house and saying stuff about me ruining their lives etc  i m currently trying to get out of there and live with a friend for some time  also supported by my therapist  and i have really bad relationship with all of my family members  so i really  really want to keep them out of it because they would just make it so much worse  also they think i m better at the moment and i really don t want to ruin the illusion     i have this emergency plan that includes me calling a friend to keep me company  look after me and accompany me to the hospital  as well as me calling my therapist to let her know what happend and get an appointment as soon a possible  i also have our contract printed out with me at all times to  proof  that i am in therapy and that i am not planning to kill myself  idk know if any this could help me convince the hospital staff to not call my parents   my cuts are always horizontal and not vertical  don t know if that helps too   i just really  really hope it s possible to get stitched up without the family knowing and i would really appreciate some advice on how to do so if any of you have any tips,1

t3_dlqlt8,Thissucks102019,suffering in a world that all seems pointless,hi there    throwaway account for obvious reasons    this is going to be weird and written poorly as i just spill thoughts from my head onto the page  i don t know where to begin or how to say it  so i m just going to mash the keyboard and get it out there  i m hoping that among you there s a kind person to offer some words of wisdom    so i m depressed to the point where i don t see any point in going on  i m spending my days in my own little bubble just going through the motions  i get up and go to work where i m a senior compliance officer for an online gambling company  i live on a small and admittedly beautiful island that i do consider myself very lucky to call home  i have a large family    children from the same parents  and we are very close  by all accounts i should be very happy with the life that i have  and that s the problem right there  i know i should be happy  there are many  many people in the world who are very happy and are not as fortunate as i am to have the upbringing and life in general that i have  but for some reason i find myself increasingly lost  i take very little joy out of my daily routine and very often distract myself with video games and smoking marijuana  this doesn t make me happy as such  it simply distracts me from the thought of having to get up the next day and do the same old routine all over again       let s try and add some more depth to this miserable story  i m sure right now people are considering me ungrateful and a whiny little shit  don t worry  i think that of myself too  i mean how can i be so selfish as to squander these gifts i ve been given  i don t know and i hate myself for it    so  as i said  i live on a small island where i have a relatively good job  it doesn t pay amazingly but it s not bad  unfortunately for the last    years  approximately  i have been in debt and doing nothing but living payday to payday  i found myself shutting myself in doors drinking and gambling heavily  i would finish work in the office and go back to my tiny ground floor flat  apartment for my colonial cousins  where i d drink to the point of passing out and waking up in the morning to see not how much i d won  but simply how much money i d taken out  one time i took out a loan via my online banking and didn t even realise i had done so until a few weeks later  i was low  so low  i then started to worry about money even more to the point that i was getting into so much unnecessary debt and i couldn t find a way to stop  i had definitely developed both a gambling and a drinking problem by the time i was     fuck  where did it all go wrong    i have been a long time sufferer of anxiety which has resulted in me developing ibs which triggers when i get anxious  and you know what makes me anxious  the fear of getting anxious and shitting myself quite literally whilst walking to work or anywhere  i don t like taking long car journey s  basically anything over    minutes  and regularly cancel events i would actually very much like to attend just so that i can avoid the embarrassment of an event that will likely never happen  this has cost me relationships  jobs and i think many of the greatest years of my life  or so i m told  i seriously hope not   all that lost  because i can t stop being a nervous little shit   the scariest thing about all this is that i know that people around me have no idea that i feel like this all the time  i always hide behind a jokey facade and smile and laugh and do nice deeds and help people  that s what i m meant to do right      recently i ve started thinking about life and what is the point of this  i m suffering to live a life that probably means nothing in the grand scheme of things  i don t believe in an afterlife  i think that once your time has ended you simply cease to be  your body will remain but even that will fade in time and nobody will remember you once your family have passed on  so why do we do this to ourselves  why go to work and make someone else money  why worry about what anyone thinks of you  ultimately we ll all be lost to the annuls of time with noone to remember our deeds or achievements  even if they could remember  what does it matter to me  i ll be dead  i won t be able to enjoy any of it in any way  so why bother trying to succeed  why bother caring what anyone thinks of you  why bother doing anything at all  nothing matters       why should i put myself through all this pain on a daily basis  all i do is watch everyone around me grow up and do all the things i ve been told and am still told i should be doing  get a girlfriend  buy a house  settle down  get in shape  work hard  have a family  and all the other things in life that i now see are completely and utterly pointless and nothing but a waste of time  but then  if that s all pointless  then what should i do with my time  i have time and nothing else  that is how i feel  nothing but time and emptiness  so why not just take all of this medication the doctors have put me on all at once and put an end to the suffering       the only reason i haven t done so already is because i do still care about my family and friends  i know that me doing that would make them suffer and i don t want to do that  but would they really want me to suffer in silence and know that the only reason i don t end it all is because i don t want them to be sad like i am  would they consider that fair       i know that they would try to help me find a way back to the flock  but right now i don t see a way back and to be honest i m not sure i want a way back  why would i put all that effort into something that ultimately doesn t seem to matter in the slightest     amp  x   b   i could have said a lot more and offered more detail and a greater insight into my warped little world       i saw joker the other day and i was sat there thinking  i wonder if anyone else is relating to this on the same level as i am    not the violence  but the sad little world he lived in  nobody realising what he s going through or caring      please someone tell me what i should do       rant over  i mean  it s not  i could sit here all night and just keep typing  but i have to get up and go through the whole god damn shitty routine again tomorrow ,1

t3_dl9s2x,Justreleasetheupdate,something clicked in my brain after a long thought process and i don t feel suicidal anymore ,it s so weird  i ve gone from  fuck all of this  i should just off myself  to a complete different perspective just because i had an idea that cones up every time i think about things that make me suicidal in the first place   so i always had thoughts like  i ll never find a family i m a burden to everyone i ll never be successful  and so on   and recently it occurred to me that all of those are coming from nature trying to do it s thing and force me into societal life activity like being beneficial having a partner   after that i had some more thoughts about nature  it s very brutal  right  it forces things to follow it s rules without reason and kill to survive  makes things feel pain and sadness   so why the fuck am i giving into it  i have    fat in my body which is all in my fat penis which nature can suck  fuck you  nature  i m not going to be your slave and give into your shit that wants me to follow       year old instincts  you fucking bloody tyrant  i hope i never ever return to feeling hopeless again just to fuck over nature ,1

t3_dl85uj,OrangeThePlumMan,no support anywhere,college dude and my brain has been a shitshow for awhile now   my friends either don t take me seriously or i m not close enough to anyone to tell them if they even were the type of person who would care  my family ridicules me and calls me a failure despite the fact that most of them have a history of bipolar  having depression or some other disorder   but its suddenly not acceptable for me to have it  everyone trivializes it  family has cut me out of their life after i finally expressed how i m doing   the support system offered by university is shitty too  group therapy somehow managed to alienate me as i was seen as the weird one  counselors just tossed my case from coworker to coworker who all were disinterested and spouted the same garbage until i had enough and quit that  and trying to get medication prescribed has been a longer process than it needs to be   i just recently had a weird thing happen at work that i m guessing has been building up for awhile now  don t really know what it was  suddenly hyperventilating  sobbing  manic laughing and eventually i just collapsed  no one batted a fucking eye   i even expect people on a depression subreddit to overlook this post  but fuck it  i had to vent at some point and i d rather not have to look at the condescending  disgusted expression i see on everyone s faces after i tell them   friends  therapists or family ,0

t3_dl5x8c,depressedempathy,why should i stay ,when i don t want to be here  when nothing brings me pleasure or joy  when i can t find comfort in my own thoughts nor solace in the words of others  when i don t care about anything  when i don t have any desire to do the things that once brought pleasure because they no longer do  when i m not even sure if i have pain because i can t feel it  when i can t feel anything  when i m empty  when i m numb  when existence itself is a burden  when existence is boring  when i have no motivation nor ability to succeed  when i m not sure if anybody actually cares about me or if they re just pretending  when i don t care if they actually care about me because i m just pretending  when i don t really care about anybody either anymore  what then  what now  why should i stay ,1

t3_dlc3x7,foundthefurry,my completely mangled sexuality,i don t think i ve seen other posts about this here but i just want to vent  depression has completely ruined my sexuality and just turned it into a mangled pile of burning tires    i ll be honest  i hadn t quite figured it out before i got depressed  but depression sure made sure i locked down that confusion and didn t go anywhere with it  am i straight  who knows  i like girls most of the time but sometimes getting down with a guy sounds fun  am i bi  maybe  except i ve never been with a guy so maybe i m actually gay  everyone else seems to know  why can t i answer such a simple question about myself  to add to this somehow i m also trying to figure out if i just really like feminine things or if that actually means something deeper     then you add in depression just killing your sex drive overall  i can t speak for anybody else but damn  depression doesn t kill my sex drive  it kills any attempt to go out and meet people and try to get a relationship or fling going  but it doesn t kill your sex drive  so it just turns into me staying at home rubbing one out literally just to force my early   s hormones to just chill for a second  any kinks i have have slowly dissolved into a puddle of  meh  and stuff i would ve died to have done to me before depression hit just seem like another item  it s such a weird thing seeing everyone else with sexual interests and clear turnons when you don t really have any anymore    i m just tired of it  i want to go back to feeling normal and feeling like i had myself figured out ,0
t3_dki6au,FucReddyt,anyone ever become overly depressed over friends family s struggles and bad events  even compared to your own ,one of my good online friends  i mostly have online friends  i m as close to some of my online friends as i ever was to anyone irl  had something bad happen to him recently  he still won t tell me what happened  but the few details i could get from him it sounded like maybe all of his siblings died and he s the only child left  i m not      sure but it really messed him up and i ve been feeling really bad for him since i learned about it  like it s consuming more of my worrying thoughts in the day than my own problems   not that i think i shouldn t feel bad for him  but i m starting to feel weird for talking to a few other close friends about this  when i describe the situation out loud in text it sounds    obsessive almost  but i m just worried about his mental health  honestly  dealing with so much shit myself i try to help people  particularly my close friends  stay out of it  i m not bothering him or anyone else about it  just trying to stay out of the way but offer support when needed    i guess i m just looking to see if anyone else has ever had this  feature  of depression  i m not sure if it s some form of self destruction  i ve been dealing with that in all kinds of forms lately   or what    just wondering if anyone can relate to being almost obsessively worried about a close friend s problems more than your own ,1

t3_dldt0d,dogcatmoose,just needed somewhere to vent about my life right now,as of right now in my life  i feel like i have nobody to talk to about my issues so here i am to spew my guts  clinically  i ve had major depression and anxiety for over a year now  but i ve suffered way longer than that  i m on two different antidepressants and i don t think they re enough anymore  but then again  my life has overall been hectic the last few months so i think it just might be in my head  bear with me  this is going to be all over the place    to put it into perspective  i m a third year nursing major  too much stress  but in the end it will be rewarding  and i m someone who is also very hard on themself  i expect myself to be perfect and do perfect  when i m not  i kind of spiral out of control and everything collapses along with it  i failed one of my major classes tests  which isn t like me  but it coincides with everything else happening    i had a relationship from april until the end of august and it was beyond toxic  i cringe over how foolish i was and how i allowed myself to be treated because i thought it was  love   obviously  it wasn t and i was terribly upset during the entire relationship  the guy i was with was manipulative and knew how to mold me like clay  i m not proud of what i put myself through because lots of people told me i deserved better  i knew i did  but i loved this person so i stayed  i thought i could fix him  i thought i could heal all his wounds  but by doing this  i reopened all of mine that i had worked months to heal  he ended up moving back to school and i wanted him to commit to me  but he wouldn t  i spent a good month thinking i wasn t good enough for him or anyone even though i put him on a pedestal and put up with his lies  i never thought i would end up in an emotionally abusive relationship  but here i am  booboo the fool    fast forward a few weeks from that episode  my friend persuaded me into downloading tinder so i could get over this guy  i didn t want to because it felt dirty and wrong  but i knew i needed a distraction  this was a whole ass mistake and for anyone reading this  don t be stupid like i was  i matched with this guy who was a friend of a friend  and i was coaxed into pursuing him  everything was wonderful  like a story tale  i couldn t believe i was finally getting what i had longed for  well fast forward to the present  all good things come to an end and he just wants to remain friends  that just added to my shit pile  when i have interest in someone  i develop feelings fast and hard  it s all biting me in the ass now   a few weeks ago my best friend and i had a falling out  she has been battling her own demons and i love her to death  she knows that i ve been battling my own too  but together  our battles become completely exhausting  we both agreed we needed room to breathe to try and heal but of course we said we would still be here if we needed each other  i m used to talking to this girl all day every day about stupid shit  i ve felt lost without her and i ve expressed this to her  it s just that things have been very hard for her  i respect her needs of course  it s just difficult when your main emotional support is missing  usually  she s the one i would be running to to discuss everything i am in this post  but she s not here    half the time i don t even know how to put into words how i m feeling  i constantly feel like i have something sitting on my chest  there s always a lump in my throat  the only time i feel most normal is when i fake it going to class  work or eating dinner with my family    i know that some may suggest i talk about how i m feeling with my family  except we re not that kind of family  we each are very private and deal with things on our own  it s not the healthiest  but i guess it s what works for us as a unit    if you ve read this far  thank you  i know i probably sound dumb as my issues are very minute compared to others  i just needed to vent and get it out so i would stop crying and hopefully go to sleep  there s so much more going on with me personally  but this post is already long so i m going to cut it short    i plan on talking to my primary about getting referred to a therapist psychiatrist and maybe altering some of my meds to help improve my daily quality of life    and a reminder for those of you who struggle like me  there are brighter days ahead  keep trucking along and you are not weak for wanting or looking to receive help  you are strong and your journey isn t over yet  it may feel like the end of the world  but i promise  it s not ,0

t3_dlrovm,CallumJK98,depression story,hi everyone  i don t know who s going to see this but i wanted to share a little on my life story   i grew up loving life was very sporty and very popular in school  i could get any girl i wanted etc  but this was early  all before     at that age my mum forced me to move out of catchment to a school with far better grades leaving all my great relationships behind  it s the only mistake she s ever made my mums amazing     it was so tough at that age to transition into a completely new school life and i was constantly anxious and despite always being popular at previous schools i never spoke to a girl for two years at that school  this kind of isolation and change i believe led my mental health down the wrong path   i ve smoked a ton of weed since i was    and and have had depressive thoughts since around when i moved school but i brushed them aside as they weren t so tragic   however now at    i have had serious suicidal thoughts daily for the past couple of years and one day after resisting drugs my whole life i was crying myself to bed one time and said to myself this really is enough i ve battled this shit for   years  i don t deserve it and it s gradually got tragically worse  so i finally tried mdma and of course it was the greatest experience ever    i ve since then done mdma about    times in   months which i know is ridiculously stupid and has fucked my brain chemistry  however i don t crave it so i ve got over that stupid binge now  i ve recently been binging on xanax too  the crazy thing is i haven t had any serious comedowns from these drugs ever  just tiredness and a lack of appetite   even with doing shifts on   hour sleep etc  i ve also felt brighter these last two months since i started doing hard drugs  that will most probably change i know   i have serious thoughts of suicide everyday and the voice in my head just pounds me with the things that it knows upset me most  over the years i ve become so subdued with my parents and our relationship has never been the same  maybe because i m just living one big lie  it s like i live two completely different lives   in honesty most of my depressive and suicidal feelings have stemmed from the fact of being so lonely everyday  feeling worthless and like no one gives a shit about me which is so hard as i used to be popular and someone people looked up to   the fact i could get any girl at one point and now i m a    year old loser who s only had one sexual partner in the last   years and having no one show any kind of interest at all is totally demoralising now  most people grow and blossom out as they grow older  i ve became the opposite    i have never shared such a thing and thank anyone who s took time to read this  i ve gone from loving life to wondering why i m living it and suffering awful pain almost everyday   is there anyone feeling a similar kind of way and what changes can i make in my life to see an improvement and maybe put a true smile back on my face one day ,0

t3_dk848s,megmotz,broke up with a girl who i loved and is suicidal,i have been in a long distance relationship since more than   years now  we were two lonely people when we met and socially awkward so we always used to stay in and hide from the world even though we were in different parts of the world  over those couple of years we got quite dependant on each other  she s always been suicidal and i m a depressed shit   we promised each other we ll always be there for each other  but about a month ago she got a real boyfriend  someone who s really there for her and is kind too as she tells me  the problem is that she wanted me to stay and keep in contact with her everyday too  i tried and i tried to be selfless and i also accepted the fact that what she did is practical and right for both of us as our dreams of meeting ever are probably never going to come true  but my own selfish emotions and the fact that i always felt alone  i don t have friends  i was totally dependant on her  kept coming in between and so i told her i wanted to leave   she didn t want me to leave and she s very stubborn so she tried really hard to stop me but eventually she blocked me and told me i ll never hear from her again  i still love her and even though she doesn t understand now  i think i made the right decision as i would have only made her and myself more unhappy  been affected mentally  lost weight  keep zoning out  feeling anxious  etc   if i stayed longer   she s actually a really beautiful person and i don t want her to kill herself  and she depended on me too much in the last two years but since she got her boyfriend  she hasn t had much time for me    did i take the right decision  am i a terrible person  we did keep each other alive for more than   years but could i have done more and stayed with her even now  she does have her friends who care for her but i was always the one who got her back from the darkest places   i wish i could just make her understand that i support her but i have to stop thinking about her too  before she blocked me i told her she should message me whenever she feels too low or goes into her dark place  but i don t think she will  and i ll always live in regret because i won t know if she s even alive or not ,1

t3_dkkqo3,angelbaby316,i dont deserve to feel this way,for the past few years  i ve always had thoughts of killing myself  but never did it  i can have a wonderful day with friends but something will happen and i end up feeling like a waste  i m only     so when i tell my parents i want to kill myself they think i m joking or overreacting   i haven t been diagnosed with anything because i ve never told anyone other than my parents  but i can t talk in front of people  my teachers come up to me about assignments and i just freeze up  it makes me want to throw up thinking about talking  because of this my grades have been slipping  just today  my mom woke me up at   am to tell at me for my grades  it made me feel stressed  because i was trying to bring up my grades for a long time  i went in my bathroom and tried to kill myself  but stopped because i had a strong feeling of guilt  i have a relatively nice life  i live in a nice neighborhood in a nice city  i have food  on the table and a roof over my head  i dont deserve to kill myself   many people have it so much worse than me and they live on  but i m so pathetic  i dont deserve to die   but sometimes in the middle of the night  i pray to god that i never wake up  but i guess he never hears me ,1
t3_dktbmf,Calabazas24,my manifesto   a conversation with my only friend,i have deliberated and hesitated upon writing this manifesto for a considerable amount of time  one of the reasons for which that has happened relies on my intrinsic fear and inability to control my irrational part of my mind  loneliness is a miserable state of being  it damages  corrupts  and desensitized  one s mind  it is a piercing sensation that sometimes becomes unbearable and fills one with irrational anger  and hatred towards oneself  others  and life itself  when one does not have someone to talk to  someone that can provide emotional support both in good and bad times  someone that can treat and value you like a normal human being  someone that can treat you with respect and see beyond a superficial physicality  someone that can make you feel normal  or someone that can make you feel loved and appreciated  it wrecks and shatters one s heart  loneliness has ruined my life  i have been socially rejected by every single group that i have attempted to join  i have been ridiculed for my physical appearance  and the only time that someone approached me involved a utilitarian relationship  there are several reasons for which those events might have occurred  but that is something that i will address later on  the main purpose of this manifesto consists of expounding the causes and reasons for which i became the person that i am now  i did not want to become this person  but life and  partly  my own decisions shaped me into this irremediable predicament  loneliness is not the only topic that i will discuss in this manifesto  i will also touch on a plethora of things that i have always wanted to express  but  as i stated before  fear and an irrational inability to control my mind prevented me from doing it before  this manifesto is written for the only person that has always been there for me  this manifesto is for my only friend  myself   the most suitable place to start  i consider  is in my early life  i was born in the year      in a south american country  my early life could be defined as one of the best periods of my life  i did not have to worry about much  i was surrounded by a loving family  but i was not really aware of the circumstances that would permeate the rest of my life  even though my family was caring and provided me with unconditional love  i still missed one thing  a father  i have never seen my father  but i know and hope that one day i will meet him  my father was killed two months before my mother gave birth  my country of origin  at the time  was plagued with high criminality rates  and he was one of the victims  my mother suffered a lot  and  based on numerous of her accounts  she was extremely depressed  i can only imagine being about to give birth and having to attend the funeral of your husband and soon to be father  it must be devastating  this might be one of the reasons for which my mind is so weak  i do not know if depression and other mental disorders can be genetically transmitted  but that can be a possibility      i will continue the writing of my manifesto in this post and i will update it regularly ,1
t3_dllv16,LemonLighter,i am so tired,every day i think about shooting myself in the head constantly  not even because i want to just for some reason my brain sees that as the solution to every problem  all day its just  well this minor inconvenience means you should kill yourself  even just being tired feels like a reason to me  i just want to close my eyes and rest and not wake up feeling just as awful as i did before  whats the point of waking up at all to feel like that,0
t3_dl89x5,Woogles94,everytime i think i have a friend they end up basically ghosting me ,i have been back and forth with my depression for a really long time      years  everytime i ve felt like i had a good relationship with someone and started to talk about myself  not even my depression just anything  i am ignored  i get that know one likes to listen to constant whining  and i really make a big effort to not talk negatively often    the last couple months have been especially hard  and i have had almost no one to talk to and unfortunately i cannot afford therapy  i had a friend at work that i would talk to sometimes about relationship stuff and just general life problems  but last week that person just suddenly decided they no longer wanted to talk to me and has been ignoring and avoiding me  this happened so often when i was younger that all i can think is i must be the worst most annoying person to meet because it seems like after a few months of friendship everyone decides they don t want to do it anymore    i know that i need to just stay to myself and stop trying to talk to people but it is hard  i hate myself but that does not stop me from getting lonely or those random times where i want to be sociable  honestly it s like i hate my life and i go back and forth all the time thinking i want to make all these changes and get out of this hole i ve built  and then i ll think there s no point and it would be easier to just not wake up     i m not sure where this post is going  i m just feeling really alone and depressed and wasn t sure where else to put my thoughts  thanks for listening reddit ,0

t3_dlcv6p,shookspearedswhore, talk to somebody   really ,the reality is  people tell you that  it s okay to talk about it    do come to me and share with me your feelings and emotions   the other reality is  when you actually talk to people and share with them my feelings  they don t want to hear it  they don t want to hear things like  i couldn t get out of bed this morning because i didn t know how to keep going   all they want to hear is  i m sad  and something of that sort  so they can just wave you off with some  inspirational quotes  or bs like  it s okay  you ll get over it  just relax and don t overthink     darling  if i can say these things to myself and some sort of miracle happens  immediately i stop overthinking and jumping to conclusions  i stop hating myself  i stop feeling i m better off dead  i don t bloody need antidepressants  if i could have a magic happy drug i would have turn to cocaine for goodness sake  how easy it is to say stuff like that when it doesn t cost them anything   but i can kind off empathise with them  they have enough troubles of their own to deal with in their lives  and the last thing they need is another person s negativity shoved down their throats  i completely understand that  and i do not want to burden them  albeit how desperately i want someone to listen to me  pathetic  but that s the state of circumstances we re in   sorry if i sound like a bitter  resentful pedant  and thank you for reading this rant ,0
t3_dllnki,RandomFrenchDude34,should i tell my family that my cousin is contemplating assisted suicide  ,hi reddit   this post was originally meant for aita  as the matter i wanted to discuss is suicide related but more of a relationship problem  unfortunately their rules don t allow to talk about suicide and redirect me here  i ll post it here as is  please forgive me for the formulation if it doesn t comply with the rules of this subreddit   my cousin is two years younger than me  and we ve always been close  i count as both friend and family to her  and that is the core of the problem  as she asked me as a friend to keep secret something that my aunt should know   my cousin is a smart  cool  brave woman in her early thirties  and she has been diagnosed with a bunch of illnesses that make her life really hard  basically  she is in constant pain in her eyes  and whenever she talks  we communicate either by text or throughout her boyfriend  her illnesses are both chronic and rare  and the doctors are befuddled as to what exactly she is suffering from   she has stopped working  she s an engineer  for three years  and is living between doctors appointments  in an appartement with closed shutters for photosensitivity  eating soup because of her jaw illness  france s healthcare is pretty good  but she still has some money problems with coping with the drugs necessary to alleviate and hopefully cure the symptoms of her diseases and the general cost of living in paris  where are the specialists who follow her  and her circle of friends   a few weeks ago  she dropped what i consider a bombshell on me  she told me that she is planning  in a few years    or     if her diseases don t improve  to undertake an assisted suicide medical procedure  probably in belgium or in switzerland  as it s apparently more legal there  she told me as a friend  part of a very restricted circle of people in the know and asked me to keep it secret   neither her mother  my aunt   nor mine  nor any other family member know about it  i am torn between keeping her faith in me  i have kept her secrets in the past  like the fact that she had a boyfriend   and telling my family what is obviously a life or death matter  even if the prospect is distant   what makes it worse to me is that she won t ask for professional help   my first reflex was asking what her shrink thought about it  unfortunately she doesn t see her anymore since it really hurts for her to talk  and she already has to talk to many doctors and social workers and feels she doesn t have the spoons for the psy   so  am i an asshole for not telling my family about this   it will be her decision  at that time assisted by professional psychologist and psychiatrs  wether to peacefully end her life or not in the end  and i am agnostic on the matter for now  please don t debate assisted suicide in comments   sorry if my english is subpar  it is my second language  also  this is my first ever post on reddit  so i hope to find useful advice   tldr   am i an asshole for not telling my family that my chronically ill cousin told me as a secret that she is planning to have an assisted suicide if her diseases don t improve in a few years  ,1

t3_dlk582,kkytwtd,the one time my refill didn t overlap   ,i unfortunately rely on meds for my depression  mostly it turns my depressed episodes to shorter existential reflections  definitely more sustainable    my prescription autorefills which has been great especially because it normally overlaps and i don t have to worry about running out    well it hasn t refilled and after a long weekend of drinking and hard social triggers i m left feeling like it doesn t fucking matter if i take my meds  it doesn t matter that i m not actually important to anyone s wellbeing  the only reason it actually matters if i work is because people expect me to be there but my position is literally the most expendable    i don t wanna be around  i m so done with life  i ve got all the insight in the world but when the depression really washes over that matters for jack shit  i feel like i ve already drowned  i mean  who am i really  an amorphous blob with nothing but dead dreams and waste to leave behind   i want to die         what s worse is that i know i ll hold on  to all of my nothing with a vice grip and i ll feel so much relief when i finally get in that final fatal car accident or when i finally get to witness the actual end of the world  anyway that s hoping    for all i know i ll end up an    yr old living in a box on the street turning tricks for drugs      one thing that s always helped me go on tends to turn around in times like this  i have no idea what the future could hold ,1
t3_dkz889,windy_beans,my family supports the idea of my suicide,my family  mom and twinsister  and i are very close  always have been   i struggle with depression and just te feeling of not belonging here since i can remember  i do not think it s weird not wanting to live  i don t feel threaten by it or anything     i have a very powerfull adhd with manic depressions   i ve been on several medications since    years and in therapy since    years  i have a very loving and caring net of friends  a very supportive supervisor and about everything you could possibly want  jobwise and socialwise   in switzerland  the medical support is great and i am able to try almost everything  it will be paid or at least the biggest part will be paid      i ve recently started with focalin   dexmethylphenidate  and a lot of stuff is better now    but even if i m genuinly smiling  there is my voice in my head telling me  that this is endless suffering and this overwhelming feeling of not belonging needs to stop  that this life needs to end to finally find  peace and rest     i do talk open about this with my family  they are with me on every step i take     both are very upset about not beeing able to help  which i don t feel they should have to     and suffer with me whenever rockbottom is close  during a very bad episode i was in a clinic and they asked my  why i did not commit suicide  why i still carry that burden     to me   the vision of commiting suicide and them having to pack my stuff  tell people and just getting left behind by me    is just the worst thing  after i ve told them  they said not to stay here just because of that  the see and especially my twinsister feel the pain and the despair and they see  why suicide seems like a solution to me     we all cried so long and it was so touching  but also so sad and hard  rn it is very hard again and the suicide thoughts are starting to really bother and disturb me  my mom just yesterday said to me  that she would do whatever it takes to help me or finally end this  suffering  not like killing me or something like that  but find a way method i can go definit and final    it breaks my heart  that my mom has to think about that and it scarres me that i suddenly feel to have chosen the path of suicide   thank you for giving me a space to write this ,1

t3_dler64,moonagexdaydream,finally have the means to end my life ,i ve been sad for as long as i can remember  i started self harming at    years old  and was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder at     major depressive disorder at     and borderline personality disorder at     i ve wanted to die since i was very young  i remember when i was around   years old i told my mother that i hoped i would die before i turned    because i  don t want to be alive for that long     i ve made countless suicide plans  tried to hang myself multiple times  have taken overdoses and stood at bridge railings many times waiting for the guts to jump  but i can either never get it right or else i can t find the courage in the moment to go through with it    today i bought a single use charcoal grill  i had gone into the store a few times over the week to look at it and would convince myself not to buy it each time  but this morning  after a night of intense  painful suicidal thoughts but no way to act on it  i bought the charcoal    i plan on driving somewhere remote and letting the charcoal burn in my car  i imagine death by c   to be as painless as suicide can get    i won t do it today  or maybe not tomorrow  or maybe not even this week or this month  but i feel safe and secure knowing that i finally have a means to end it when i feel like i need to  i feel safe knowing that i don t have to endure this life anymore    i feel a strange sense of freedom ,1
t3_dku454,poisonedtap,would you rather pass by noose or by overdose ,i don t think i d enjoy my last few moments with a broken neck and only the slightest capability of breathing  on the other hand  sweating  seizing  etc  don t sound well either  if i m high on meds it won t be so bad  but neither would a quick death by noose  ups and downs to both  which is better   btw i m on a budget so nothing too expensive  i have a while before following through  but i m not sure how much longer i can support myself with such little money ,1
t3_dlu1h5,ConsciousWelder,everyone wants to die , not a native speaker sorry for bad english  don t you guys ever feel like what you re going through and wanting die is normal  sometimes i feel stupid for asking for help and thinking that i probably need medication because  don t we all  feel like that  i don t know  am i wrong if i say everyone has attempted suicided or at least thought about it at one point in life  am i really sick for wanting to die  am i wrong if i go to bed wishing not to wake up next morning  when i was in  th grade  i m a senior at hg  i asked my friend if she had ever tried to kill herself  and she looked at me as if i had just spoke another language  she didn t understand why i was asking her that and said she had never and would never do it  i thought about it for a moment and i knew she lied to me  for me it was impossible and it still is  to think that suicidal thoughts don t affect everyone  i m pretty sure my friends don t think i have these kind of thoughts  i m the one who s always  happy  and making jokes and stuff  what if they think of this too  what if everyone wants to die but nobody dares to say it  and once you have attempted to and you end up in a hospital  that s when you have  depression   isn t that how it is  i m not diagnosed but i feel as if everyday that passes is closer to the day i m finally gonna do it  one day will come and it s no gonna be like the other days when i was too coward to do it  that day will happen  one part of me doesn t want it to come but the other is anxiously waiting for it  because it should have happened a long time ago ,0

t3_dkpsm6,wilkor17921,i think about donating organs as a way of suicide ,well  as the title says  recently more and more i think about donating all of my organs in near future as my way of good bye  i am scared of ending it myself  but with such a method  it would ensure painless  and quick death  and far less self blame on my family   only people that seem to care in any way about me  but i am nothing  but baggage to them  as there is nothing good from me   and i would save couple people that want to live in the process  i am    and i already don t see any reasone to continue struggle  and it will only get worst  as i don t have any self discipline to change anything in my life  it is just getting worst and worst  and i hate myself more and more everyday  small things in life does not matter for me  at best i just feel numb  very rarely happy  i am alway one that is getting bullied  usually not in physical  but in a psychological way  one that is left out  and one that could disapear  and people still would have same fun  and would not see any diffrence  and one that is made fun off  i  some times feel that only reasone for me to be here  is for people entertaiment  so they can laugh out of me  i just don t see any reasone to keep fighting  why not just save couple lives on a way off ,1
t3_dkkhlt,nylostandfound,i m a   yo virgin and planning on ending it soon,i had some failed relationships in the past but for upbringing and other shit reasons i m still a virgin   i make very good money but i m too depressed enjoy it   i have no friends  no one to talk to  no one gives a shit for me  i m fucking invisible in the world  i developed a very toxic mindset  maybe even racist and misogynist  too that i m ashamed of  it is not me   i don t even know if my looks caused my problems  but it don t matter at this point  a guy my age who is a virgin might as well be the elephant man  i am already dead in spirit  why not physically too   i found a very beautiful place to end it  a very tall  waterfall where you can wander off a trail   where it can even look like an accident  you hit the bottom and drown  i can t swim   i read some of these posts here and people kill themselves with everything to live for  kids  loving spouse  etc  i m not undermining anything but if i had those things i can assure you      i wouldn t be here  because i would be thinking of what i leave behind  i can t find anything in my case  i m human shit as far as i m concerned   i was a god fearing person  but god abandoned me  i believe if he left me in this state  he don t care in the least what i do  loneliness is the worst curse ,1
t3_dksclr,Cococat512,i ve ruined my own life  there are no better ways out  and i wish to die,my family warned me not to study psychology  i studied psychology in undergrad and didn t try too hard to find a job look employable  with my naive self thinking my bachelors degree and mediocre gpa would just land me a job somewhere and not understanding the reality  i ve graduated now and realized not only do i not want to work in the field  but it s really hard to find work with a bachelors in psychology where i live  i m barely holding onto my job right now and don t see job stability as part of my future unless i go to grad school and make up for lost time  i should ve studied something way more practical like comp sci or biostats  i don t see myself having a secure job unless i go back to grad school which i dont want to do  i wish i d just sucked it up and majored in something i hated so at least i wouldn t be worrying about losing my job  and now i could be    and enjoying my life and having fun with friends etc  but i can t turn back time and only feel that i completely totally wasted my undergrad experience when my family was still supporting me financially  i was young and impressionable  and could ve made sure to secure a job  my family warned me not to study psychology  i wasted their money  i wasted my time and youth  i m     and don t see a hope for my future getting better unless i confront the amount of time i wasted in undergrad  i have no friends either  i wish to die now ,1
t3_dllr75,sorrystheonlywordino,after so so many years of pain i can finally say i am no longer depressed,i don t really know where to begin  it wasn t even a week ago when i thought all was lost  i had no faith in anything but i finally found a reason to be faithful it literally hit me like a ton of bricks and everything changed i am just so happy simple as that and i just do not see things changing anytime soon for me i don t know how it happened but the fact that someone as lost as me can have an unexpected life altering experience and just feel so much better overall and just feel so great in less than    hours it happened believe it don t believe it in    hours my entire mindset shifted from fuck the world fuck my life kill me now to holy fuck life is the single greatest thing that has ever happened to me  you don t know me  you don t know just how fucking far gone i was and there is just one simple truth anything is possible how could it not be  the fact that someone as lost as this mother fucking piece of trash can flip a switch he didn t know existed than that means it can happen to you as well  i know it sounds cliche as fuck but the power of belief is so much stronger than we realize  i thought there was no hope i thought there was no way it could get better i was wrong and i so not give a fuck what kind of life you live  if you feel this way too you are wrong you are wrong you are fucking wrong and never god damn forget it i love all of you i love everyone never attempt to kill yourself i am living proof that it doesn t matter how bad it gets there is always hope               i know it won t be easy for you but it will get better tell yourself that everyday because it is true and i swear on my life if you can find a way to convince yourself of that it will be true the power of belief is so incredibly strong i can t even begin to stress this enough and it might even be the key to getting better you have to fucking believe it is the key ingredient to unlocking you re potential again i am living proof and honestly i am so grateful for getting depressed in the first place without it i would have never have understood that there is no limit to what we can accomplish if it wasn t for depression i would probably be just a regular guy but now i feel unstoppable           love you love you love you you are all loved never fucking forget                   ,0

t3_dloukc,HTGduck,finally wanting to reach out for help ,okay to start off i am    years old  i started my career in law enforcement as soon as i turned     i just recently accepted a job at a major company and left law enforcement due to accepting this said position where the top out pay is     more an hour than my top out pay at my local sheriff s department   i ve been battling with depression for around two to three years now  i am not suicidal  i do lack joy in almost all things completely and will lock myself in my house for months on end to seclude myself from people  minus going to work and the grocery store  i use to love being the center of attention at parties  now i cringe thinking about being surrounded by people  i have yet to seek help mainly due to the stigma in law enforcement that if you are diagnosed with depression or ptsd you are basically stuck where you are at and never move up  i ve seen some stuff that stays with me from time to time  now that i am no longer in law enforcement i feel a slight freedom that is allowing me to really want to get help  i have scheduled my first visit with a doctor about my mental health and it is covered under my insurance thankfully    my main reason for posting here is for advice  now that i m finally going to try to get help  where do i go from here ,0
t3_dllpy0,grenadeattack,kinda rant kinda looking for advice,so recently a lot has been going on which has just made life pretty unbearable  my girlfriend told me she needed a break  my parents split  which while for the best is still hard to see   currently on the brink of failing two classes  anyway life has just been hell and i ve lost all motivation for everything  the only thing that helps to lighten my mood is lifting and i hurt myself in the gym so now that s off the table    started on wellbutrin and that hasn t done anything for me  this past weekend i had a breakdown in the middle of the store and another one when i got home  luckily i was with someone  my ex gf of all people  she was very worried about me and cared about me but i think the hardest thing that s happened to me was seeing how much i scared her by what i said and didn t say  she was nervous i was gonna kms to which i gave no response when she asked me  not because i want to die but just because i hate life  it got to the point that she started crying because she was so nervous i was going to do something i d regret  especially because she s had a lot of people in her life that she cared about go out that way    despite that occurrence i still hate my life and can t seem to bring my mood up  the last couple days have been close to me just not getting out of bed to face the world  i want to get better but i just feel like it s at the point where i m hurting so many people and there s nothing that s gonna make me normal again,0
t3_dlnwfq,SausageSlam,time to take another depression nap,i take these like once or twice a week  i know they don t make me feel better most of the time but at least it s not being awake aware  i like to think of it as being closer to death  in that way i guess it makes me feel better     amp  x   b   kill me please ,1

t3_dkg3eo,ersatz101,dead already,everyone thinks i m already dead  i ve been isolating myself for so long that they ve given up contacting me  the thought of popping up out of the blue again and pulling them along this little string of faux hope is agonizing and honestly pathetic at this point  it makes me feel so guilty  maybe it will be easier for them if they think i m dead already ,1

t3_dlp6gc,deceptionnist,worried about sinking again,hello everyone  i am seeking genuine help here  first  sorry for the sloppy style  english is not my mother tongue   i have been subject  throughout my mid teen years  to a period of depression  characterised by a general apathy  constant self blame and the inability to rejoice for anything  since then  my life has taken a tremendously positive turn  i finally got in a relationship with my high school sweetheart  and have entered the national equivalent of a postgraduate school  in an area that always thrilled me  for the first few weeks  the darkness briefly disappeared  i could finally be genuinely happy about something  but i feel it creeping in again  little by little  i m again becoming unable to truly feel anything  as if my responses to stimuli were automatic  i know for sure some of you there have it way harder than me  i know i  should  be happy  how could i complain  i ve got everything past me would have so dearly wished he could have  but i m feeling like i m turning into him again  becoming  once more  an empty shell  i m not sure about telling this to my gf  as she s abroad at the moment   hope this was not too long to read  thanks for any help anyone can provide,0
t3_dljpkh,anonTwat1,is anyone else here a bit of a workaholic  though possibly less so in the traditional school career sense  ,i m bipolar but can t post there on a throwaway and i spend a lot of time in depressive so here i am    i think i m a bit of a workaholic in that i m pretty much always working on something  productive   and it s quite common for me to be working almost nonstop  even while eating and on the toilet and so forth  from the moment i wake up to the moment i crash into bed   however  i m not really a workaholic in terms of school or jobs   i m still fairly ambitious  at a top school on a competitive course  going for a first and decent career  and also have a bad habit of agreeing to lots of extra shifts at my part time jobs  and strive to do well  but i tend to do the minimum amount of work required to succeed therein  and don t like going above and beyond with work  last year at university for example i literally got     overall to the nearest    which is what you need for a first   on the other hand  when it comes to personal projects and stuff like volunteer work and helping others  i constantly have ideas and slave away relentlessly past the point of exhaustion  i ll often pull all nighters and just sacrifice aspects of my life like sleep  eating  exercise  social life etc  to crank out as much work done as possible    i don t really know how to relax and rarely watch tv  play video games  go out with friends etc  anymore cause i feel like i m wasting time i could be being productive producing something  work is pretty much the only thing that brings me a sense of satisfaction meaning and makes me feel slightly less useless and pathetic in my existence  and just generally cynical and hopeless about the world   anyway i was just wondering if anyone else here is similar  i have some theories as to why i push myself to work so hard and think a lot of it stems from low self esteem  feelings of guilt  anhedonia  anxiety  existential dread etc  but am interested to hear why others feel like they might be this way    i know it may seem counter to depression  and i do go through periods of  worse  depression in total despair where i can t get myself to do anything  though i can normally now get into the mindset of it s better to stay alive doing  something  like volunteering than kill myself  and i somehow manage to push through the darkest periods    if you re still reading this i hope you have a nice day whoever you are    ,0

t3_dlto7d,ehetazar,i have an exam tomorrow,   that i didn t study for  i ll probably do very badly   i was supposed to finish high school last year but dropped out two weeks into year twelve  i couldn t handle it anymore  i let other people talk me into trying again after a year  take a break  they said  guess what  the break did absolutely nothing for me except make me feel like a failure   i m     i never thought i d make it so far and subsequently i never prepared for adult life  i never made an effort to gather work experience or even try to find a career path for me   now i have come to a horrifying realization  i really really don t want to die  i like living  so the easy way out is just no option for me anymore and i just sort of have to stumble forward and i m so tired of it   i tried to kill myself when i was     i remember feeling so happy as i fell asleep because i thought it would finally be over   the  stumbling forward   i thought  even if i survived  if someone found me  i d go to hospital and something would happen and my life would change and i wouldn t have to cluelessly wander through life anymore  unsure if i even wanted it  every step a struggle  of course  i just woke up and i had to get rid of the evidence and clean up a huge mess and blood and it was the worst day of my life and i had to continue on like nothing happened    i used to go to therapy until about two months ago  i went there for a little over a year  it didn t help me at all  i made no progress whatsoever  i told my therapist i didn t want to see her anymore and i haven t made an effort to find a new therapist since  i m not even sure if i want a new therapist  i have very little time now with school  i hate school  i hate school so much  i always have  i feel like i can t drop out now because i already have one failed attempt  i am mad at other people for talking me into going back and i am more mad at myself for letting them  i wish i d stuck to my original plan  i could be working right now   the thing is  i don t do terrible in school in general  i m good at my mothertongue and i get as in english  i like philosophy and law  biology and geography  i do pretty well in these subjects  too  but where i m from  the oral grade counts        of the final grade  i don t like talking in front of the class  so i get bad oral grades and my written grades do little to improve that  in addition to that  there are the subjects i don t like  math  p e   french  theatre  those truly make school torture for me  the worst thing is  it never gets easier  it doesn t matter if i make it through french on monday  there s math waiting for me on tuesday  it doesn t matter if i make it through the entire week  there will be another one after the weekend  it never stops    i feel so helpless  i don t want to go on but i feel like i have no choice   it s almost   am and i need to be at school to take my exam at    so i ll try to get some sleep now ,0

t3_dl2qa6,NerdyPrincess83,i can t sink or swim,i am in limbo and it is tearing me apart   a month ago  i was so close   rope in hand  standing at the rivers edge   i felt more peace at that moment than i had in years    now here i sit  with opportunities of a lifetime in front of me   but i just can t seem to be able to see past my own nose   everything is a damp blurred fucking living nightmare inside of my head     i get up every day and force myself to do anything beyond merely existing   it is almost painful to do   i feel so fucking heavy all the time    i keep thinking about how i used to be  how much better things were when i wasn t drowning   i miss how i used to be so fucking much   i would do anything to get that back   i look through photos of my life and i spend hours trying to figure out why i am cursed to feel so different     it all happened suddenly   i was fine   then i woke up one day and everything was different   i have been fighting so hard to find my way through this darkness but nothing nothing nothing has worked   i cant take it  i will not be able to sustain this much longer    i am so deeply saddened that i may have to leave this current existence   it isnt fair   why was i given a life  only to have it ripped out of my hands and now i am forced to watch it with a crumpled mind   what did i do to deserve feeling this way     i am so scared,1
t3_dku974,mnbvcxzzxcvbnm0,i ve been unemployed all year  began hitting myself whenever i get frustrated and tonight i can t stop,backstory  sobstory  i lost my job in january when it changed management  i loved it and i d held it for six years  ever since i graduated college  i still have not found a new job despite applying to about    per day  entry level stuff as well as things related to my previous title   i have no family whatsoever and very little support system  there s no one i could live with while  getting back on my feet   injuries from a car accident a couple of years ago have also made it impossible for me to stand longer than   or   hours straight  making retail food service jobs impossible   i previously had parttime jobs in these fields in addition to my aforementioned fulltime office job  but i had to quit them after the accident     in an attempt to broaden my opportunities and puff up my resume  i tried to teach myself coding data analytics skills via numerous different online courses  some free  some not  but i sucked at it  even when having online study groups and watching supplementary youtube videos  etc  i grew so frustrated with it that i started hitting myself in the head or punching myself in the face when i encountered something i couldn t solve  i never had a problem with self harm before  not even in my most challenging college classes  but this got really really bad    then an irl friend tried to teach me a new software program that he thought would be advantageous for me  and the same thing happened   we met up once  he tried to show me the ropes  we installed it on my laptop and he gave me some homework  i started hitting myself at home after spending hours on only the second exercise  then when we met up at his place the second time  i couldn t stop myself from hitting myself in front of him  and he ended up giving me his benzos to make me stop  i feel so ashamed now    i feel stupid and impatient and alone and incapable of learning anything that would make me useful    my savings are running out now and i m unable to support myself and my pet      i probably would ve started sleeping in my car months ago to save funds  if it wasn t for my pet    i guess the final straw was i had midday plans i was looking forward to with a friend today  but they spent all day sleeping missed the plans and then went out without me at night  i didn t think it effected me too bad  i tried not to take it personally  and i sat down to dedicate my time to that software  homework  again  and i couldn t  i just spiraled and everything seems hopeless and i can t stop crying and hitting myself ,1

t3_dlup2u,NorthNoscus,i m reaching a new low in my life,so i ve been thinking these past few days on how to talk to people on how i feel internally but i hope i can find someone her to give me a glimmer of hope or motivation  i ve been recently diagnosed with mdd  major depressive disorder  and i ve been wanting to tell my friends about it but i have a feeling they ll just brush it off as a joke  for a while i ve been hating myself in many different things like height thinking process being lazy and talking to people  i m      m    and asking out girls has been like a chore cause they always reject me and make fun of my height  another one of my problems is my random outbursts of sadness and rage  i can t a grip on myself it seems uncontrollable i blame myself for everything like my parent being divorced at an early age  my height my stupidity  and i just want it to end    ,0
t3_dkp5p8,moondevil18,you can t heal in the same place you were hurt  ,so i m suicidal  shocking  i know  but i m writing this because although i really don t see the point in life  i still want it to be better  i am a latina student at a well known liberal institution that i thought was my dream but turns out i was just being force fed  i had the intention of going to school to be a lawyer  which is why i m spending a fortune on this school  i am currently a junior and over the course of   years my mental health began deteriorating drastically but i always hid it from family  it was horrible in high school but i wasn t suicidal and now i am  i finally figured out this year what really interests me as a person and my family has shut me down for it  everyone has  i wanted to take a leave of absence and that was an automatic no  so was transferring  ofc i want to finish school  but if i fail isn t that worse than dropping out or transferring  like i don t understand  i work two jobs as well and ofc you ll say well quit those  but i just can t  its as if i m always trapped  always locked in a box because i have to assume everyone s expectations of me  i never had room to breathe growing up and now that i have learned what i love  i can t do that  i don t even love anyone  just my boyfriend  who has basically shown me the most loyalty i have ever seen from any person period  so basically he s the only thing keeping me alive  i wanted to kill myself twice in the last month and i am just not sure why life is like this  going to school to spend    k to not even be guaranteed if i can work enough to pay off that loan while trying to make a life for myself  life makes no sense  and i m just at a loss of what to do  school is just so bad for me right now and i m so upset that all this bullshit couldn t have happened after i would have graduated  i was such a different person in high school  excelled in sports and school  now i m struggling like crazy  i could set my priorities straight right  but to be unhappy more and more  to then probably actually die  like wtf  but everything happens for a reason right  idk anything anymore  i m just going with the flow  but also my character doesn t allow that so i m just filled with all this anxiety  as well as being depressed   they say you can t heal in the same place you were hurt  so why do i have to stay in that place  why do i have to stay for so long that it might kill me  i just want friends to talk to    if you got through this you re the real mvp  ,1
t3_dkuqzk,nilmot321,i feel so sad for my boyfriend,i ve struggled with suicidal ideation for     years  i ve talked to my boyfriend on multiple occasions throughout our   year relationship  but usually just when i m essentially having a breakdown    constantly fantasizing about my own death can get a bit heavy on my shoulders sometimes because i don t typically talk about it with anybody  i don t want to tell those close to me because i don t want anybody to try to stop me if i chose to follow through on it    when i think about it more seriously  as opposed to a passing thought   i just feel really sad for my boyfriend  my dogs and horse  my family and friends  i don t want to die because i m depressed or feel worthless or unloved  i just have a ton of anxiety and i get really panicky about jobs  i also just hate working  i feel incapable  the people who love me are surely what keep me going  i watched my family grieve when my great aunt horrifically died by a self inflicted gunshot wound  it was awful and i know it would be worse for some of my family if i did that    i don t know  it feels so normal like a coping mechanism for me when something starts to feel mildly uncomfortable  like  does this even fucking matter  it ll all be over soon  you don t need to do these important adult things because you can just end it all now  it ll all go away   sometimes when i m in a more stable mindset i think it s a little scary how far the thoughts get  i really start to think about pros and cons of methods  things i need to take care of before i m gone  what i can do to make things easier for those left behind  my sane brain knows this is not right and i really get worried about myself in those moments    i m not the kind of person who likes to be worried about or fussed over  times like right now  i wish i could just let it all out and tell someone that i think i m going to die by suicide at some point  i just feel so bad for my boyfriend  he loves me so much  so  so much  i just want to cry for him  i don t think he understands how i feel in this world because i really can t verbalize it accurately  he knows i ve struggled with some bad thoughts  but he probably doesn t know how bad it gets    sigh  it feels a little better to just type it out even if i m the only one to read it ,1
t3_dlseh0,Wandering_Sentinal,sometimes insanity seams easier ,well  im pretty sure i have been depressed since i was at least      i am    now and my depression has changed from complete emotional  turmoil to apathy  anyways im really just wanting to vent my emotions here  i have been finding myself wishing i would just go insane  i know from societies standpoint it would be bad but sometimes insanity feels like it would just be easier   it seems like it would be easier to be completely insane then support the values or society  supports s   amp  x   b   like why do so many people wish for material success when it ultimately doesn t bring happiness  i don t know maybe im just stupid and i don t realize it but our world seems so messed up in many ways ,0
t3_dlot1c,forgotlmao26873,my friends are slowly losing interest in me,man my girlfriend and like   other pretty close friends and i all used to be very close and man now i feel like they only talk to me to be polite  i don t know what i m doing and how to stop man but this shit feels so awful and i don t know what to do,0

t3_dltdb1,Immatureweenie,another night ,it s just another night for me  another night where i cry myself to sleep  another night where i wonder how much longer i will be in pain  another night that i think about ways to commit suicide  another night where i ponder who on this earth might actually love me  until my brain cannot think of any and i begin to cry harder  another night where anxiety feels my best friend  another night where my body feels trapped inside of skin that is held together by fear of what others would think if they could see the real me  another night in my room listening to music so loud that it drowns out my cries for help  another night where getting in the car and driving far away tempts every inch of my mind  another night where i count down the hours and minutes until i have to put on my happy face again  another night of  wait  time is up  happy face  on  t    hours until another night ,0
t3_dkw5pw,Im52hertzwhale,one last thing,the only thing stopping me from killing myself is that i worry no one will take proper care of my dog when i m gone  she has uncommon health issues that can t just be treated by giving her medicine  she s the only thing that loves me and the only thing i love and it breaks my heart to think of her not getting the best care when i m gone  she s the only reason i am still here at this point  but i m not sure she s enough any more  the person i live with i think would do an ok job taking care of her if i left instructions for as many possible circumstances as i could think of  they probably wouldn t be happy having her left in their care  but i m pretty sure they d take the responsibility  i ve stayed three years longer than i really wanted to for her  i don t think i can stay for her any longer ,1
t3_dlsuw2,aidan1478,i hate everything about myself ,so i m     i have a year and a half left of school  i changed programs so all my friends have already graduated  from the outside it looks like i have it all  i m a varsity athlete  executive director of three prominent student groups  an honours student  and i m one of the supervisors at my job  people look up to me  i m a trans rights activist  i m a disability advocate  i m a hard worker and i look like i persevere through things    however  i don t    i ve posted before  my family is shit basically  that situation is still horrible  however in the span of    hours i ve needed to get glued back together in emerge twice  and i haven t slept because i m laying awake dissociating trying to not kill myself  nothing feels real  i spend hours laying in one spot thinking about dying    my friends left me when i became their boss at work  my partner just dumped me because i have too much going on  i m broke and my solution to not having money is to be a sugar baby but i feel filthy because i ve been sexually assaulted and never dealt with the trauma  my ex from several years ago is saying i stabbed him  that never happened  he s currently having a psychotic break  he sexually assaulted me and i dumped him  that was it   i was in another car accident  and i failed a practical  frisbee  it s a blow off course  because i was mourning the death of my friend who got hit by a car cycling in september  my bio mom told me she doesn t want anything to do with my  my dad and step mom don t want me if i m trans   you re a monster destroying our daughter      my life has always been hard  i ve been verbally  physically  and psychologically abused for much of it  i ve been sexually assaulted four times  i m chronically ill with epilepsy  gastroparesis  and a rare blood disorder that has no cure and just destroys my body  my parents denied me access to doctors when i was a kid so my system is completely fucked up  i need surgery to repair some things and i just found that out  i keep pushing through but i m so  so  fucking  tired  i can t push through it anymore  my counsellor wanted to take me to the hospital yesterday but i managed to talk through things because i knew if i went to the hospital i couldn t kill myself    i took too many pills and i m still alive  i got a little carried away with self harm and then didn t treat it for a good hour hoping things would just end  i can t do this anymore  i hate everything about myself  nothing is good enough  i m not good enough  i made a video saying goodbye  this isn t my ex partner s fault  even though it lines up with me being dumped  time wise   did it affect things  yes  but it was more of a  final straw  situation  i can t bring myself to delete the video  i cant bring myself to think of the next    minutes let alone the next    hours   my body and mind are a mess  my life is a rollercoaster i can t get off of  i have nothing and no one  i already have someone who will take my pets when i die  i wish i could make things work  i ve tried so hard  but nothing helps  everything always falls apart  everything i touch breaks  i wreck everything  it feels like everything is out of my control  so i m going to take back that control  i can control my life  whether i live or die  i know that if i die  everything will be better for everyone  why push forward when there are so many reasons to give up  i just want to go to sleep and never wake up    these thoughts are all disjointed  none of my sentences flow properly  probably because i can t focus and also because i m just letting out what pops into my mind  my fingers are flying across the keyboard desperately trying to convey my thoughts in a last ditch attempt to talk things through with myself  no one can save me but myself  and i know that ,1
t3_dlpobk,throwaway63729199363,when i was in high school i had nobody to sit with at lunch  and when i worked up the extreme amount of courage it took for me to go to random people and try and introduce myself and did it  i always got shooed away like a disgusting insect and called names  so   ,i eventually gave up and decided it was less humiliating to sit with the autistic kids and kids with down syndrome than to try and make friends  so  for the next two years until i dropped out  i sat with the severely impaired learning class for about    minutes every school day  i never once cried at school  but i came pretty damn close when one day the teacher of that class asked me to see her during lunch and she consoled me in her classroom   i never had homicidal thoughts  but i can really understand why a more naturally distraught student would feel the need to inflict pain on his her peers  it s because of experiences like these that are not only forced upon people  but those people also have no people to talk to about it  and the viscous cycle continues ,0

t3_dld10l,JRCFOG,why do we tell others not to kill themselves ,we are our nervous system  if all someones life is suffering  are they not better off pain free  do we have trouble accepting this due to our brains will to survive and reproduce  i have had what most consider the best things in life  love  drugs and natural beauty  as nice as all those things are in the moment  it is not worth all the awful and mundane feelings that make up the majority of my existence  it is not worth the insatiable craving of those finite moments    the universe is not compatible with human happiness  i long for the embrace of non existence ,1
t3_dl1oof,facialdilemma,i want to do it but i m afraid   ,a year ago my life was so good after i was suicidal just a few months earlier  i was at uni and i had really good fun friends and was throwing parties and just loving life  i then had a manic episode in the spring leading to a psychiatric hospital leading to a diagnosis of bipolar  during that time i snapped at all of my friends and before i knew it my good life was gone   now i m back at uni and things are so different  i don t have any friends  i m doing schoolwork but other than that i just sit and watch netflix alone  i just can t see my life getting any better  im so lonely and i can t change it  i can t see myself ever finding love or having children because i can barely keep a conversation anymore    i have a bunch of sleeping pills and other meds and every week i think  this weekend i ll do it   since i don t have any friends and my family is far away i know no one will know i m missing for a while  so i could do it  yet i m scared  i m living a mundane life not believing in any purpose  my family loves me so much and just wants me to be happy but i don t think that s enough anymore  in my opinion i think people should be allowed to kill themselves bc after all we didn t have a choice to be born into this world    so  should i just fucking do it ,1

t3_dloxzg,HolyWaterLube,really think i don t deserve to vent here because i m just some edgy teenager ,so here it goes  you can all call me a quirky teenager for wanting to die  but i honestly need to dump my thoughts here   just because i feel like my friends will just brush it off like my problems aren t even worth talking about it  i ve learnt that from earlier experiences   i slept more than    hours today  i woke up many times realising that i need to be awake to get my tasks done  only to just give up and crawl back in bed   today  my mother and father played videos of the past on the tv  god  i despised every second of it  i was so happy  annoying  fucking fat and who clothed me in the most unflattering clothing ever  no wonder i got bullied  and let alone afterwards because i responded like a dead fish  it felt like a confirmation of why i already hated myself  it s like a theory  proven right  i really don t deserve to live  the earth is already over populated   they ll probably never notice   sorry  that s everything that i can get out of my brain right now  i swear it s more than that but my brain won t allow me to write more than i think to myself   have a good day you amazing people  thank you for taking your time to read my shitty story ,0

t3_dkfivf,juniper-grace,          milligrams,over the past couple of years  i ve been struggling with diagnosing and treating my mental illness  now  i am diagnosed bipolar type ii and i ve tried     different medications  i tended to refill the medications before telling my nurse practitioner that the meds weren t working for me  i ve also gotten prescription pain killers from other things and held them aside instead of using them  i ve collected hundreds of pills and have sort of been obsessing over them  i count them  and hold them  and smell them  it s eerily comforting having this fairly easy way out in the palm of my hand  i don t have enough of any single medication for a lethal dose  but i m pretty sure taking this amount of various medications would kill me  right  i ve got antidepressants  antipsychotics  mood stabilizers  anticonvulsants  even some otc tylenol  which i m allergic to   and throwing in the ibuprofen doesn t hurt either  i ve been heavily suicidal on and off for months now and i am so tired of listing the reasons i want to die  i just want to get it over with  i want to die  i m less scared than i normally am when i m having suicidal ideation  but i m still scared  that tells me maybe i don t really want to die  but i don t know  i m not even experiencing anything especially hard right now and the urge is so strong  how will i live if something horrible happens to me  i think i want to get this over with before i get into the depths of my depression again  i don t want to feel sad again  i can t do it  don t worry  i ve only got a few people who will actually be torn up about my death  my mother who i don t talk to will surely find some way to make this about her  my brothers live in various parts of the country and have happy families  my grandparents might hate this more than anyone  i have a best friend who doesn t really talk to me anymore  but i m sure he ll feel affected  he might feel really bad because he goes so long without answering me  which sucks  and i ve made a few acquaintances that know about my mental illness that i don t talk to much  they might feel guilty  which also sucks  i don t want to make anyone feel bad  i m just tired  i don t think anyone will read this whole thing  sometimes it s just nice to type something out and send it out into the world  i m numb,1
t3_dlfwbr,GotToGoSoon,wanting to die need help, i m a paranoid schizophrenic and i m just very tired  i have had suicidal thoughts everyday for probably the past     years   nothing intense though  it s usually just a  lights out  kinda thing  where i just romanticize blowing my brains out or hanging myself to get myself to sleep at night and cope with problems  it s usually just comforting but i never really plan anything  this last year i ve been arrested  fucked up my car and am in a lot of trouble with my parents  i m    and have no goals or job since i ve been arrested and live by myself     today  an hour ago  something changed i guess  i m just kinda done with life  i feel like i ve lived as much as i want and just don t really care about living anymore  today is the first day in my life where i am actually  serious  about doing it  it s not like dark or edgy or depressing anymore  i m just very comfortable with killing myself to where it doesn t scare me anymore  it s a very calm feeling as well  like i said i don t even feel depressed i feel emotionless about it  and living just seems bothersome and not worthwhile   i don t know what to do and don t see my life getting any better anytime soon because of how much of a fucking disappointment i ve  been to my parents and myself  i m lazy  unmotivated  don t care about winning at life and realize i m just a failure and refuse to change  i don t even want to try and get my life on track and just want out  it s just not worth it to me anymore  i just don t see myself changing because of how afraid i am of everything    i am calm and actually relaxed for the first time in years and i m relatively certain i am going to kill my self within the next month or so  my birthday is coming up before thanksgiving and i want to see my parents  they live in another state  before i do it so they can see me again   it s been a year   they are planning on flying me out but i don t know if i will make it that long ,1

t3_dlqy4o,zackryjay,i need some answers from people that can relate ,my bi polar disorder has flared up to what i would consider an extreme degree this year  i have been hospitalized   times this year and almost a fourth time following a recent incident    i had a child this year and he is the most amazing little boy  he has unlocked a side of me i never knew was there  his mother is a wonderful person too and i have caused her a lot of pain as well  i m ashamed to even recall some moments i ve had with her  they are just inexcusable and sometimes i wonder if demons  or something equivalent to them  are real and if i have been a host to one   this last incident was after my third hospitalization  i had come home to live with my parents which is where my son s mother also lives  tough situation  but we were doing so well  we had been communicating and i finally felt like i might have an intact family again  we went on a goodwill date  we kissed  i told her i loved her whenever i felt it was proper  but she wouldn t say it back  i do not blame her for this  she probably never will love me again  that is my problem to deal with    so  one day im at home with my two sisters and something goes off in my head  i start feeling useless and like a burden to everyone  my family is afraid of me because of the things they have seen me do  i have cut my arm wide open in a frenzy a few months back  i attempted to kill myself multiple times this year  all of the incidents following an intense debate with myself about my place in this world and if everyone would be better off if i was gone  i start having this internal debate and my mind finally got to a place where i said   okay  i have the guts now  do it before you lose your nerve and you re just a blithering whiny shell again   so  i go to the medicine cabinet and pull out a bottle trazadone and a bottle of muscle relaxers and start taking them  they are huge pills  about   seconds into this  i indeed lose my nerve again and start having a violent panic attack  i scream for my sisters  who are in their rooms unsuspecting and then this battle begins     i yell their names  i ll say lucy and kacey for their names in this story   lucy  kacey  please   i need an ambulance  i m dying   my heart is has fast as a mouse s footsteps and i m losing feeling in my extremities  i hear their footsteps and i hear a door slam   kacey  lucy  i m in here  i m here  please   my body is in full survivor mode  the back of my neck goes numb and my heart feels like a black hole in my throat  i am covered with pins and needles   lucy    no response   please  god please   at this point i hear no one  not a sound  i notice my fingers wont bend anymore and my vision is collected at a single point   please help   i finally said to god and then i blacked out  i woke up  still in full panic mode not knowing how much time had passed and was expecting an ambulance at any second  surely they called someone  are they hiding  i hear a car door slam   i m in here   i yelled right before puking all over the place  my body is covered in cold sweat  my fingers still won t move and i see the sweat marks on the couch under me and i puke again  i hear someone come through the door   in here   i said faintly  a man walks through the door frame and i see its my father   what the fuck is going on    lucy and kacey are at the neighbors house freaking out  what are you sick   why are you telling   i told him i took an overdose right before puking again  chalky white pieces of pills in a clear liquid all over the floor like a glacier broken off in the ocean   i guess we have to call the hospital  son   i said to him please don t  i dont want to go back  he said  then you tell them you are sick and thats it and shut the fuck up if you dont want to go back to the hospital   i agreed and promptly passed out again  i woke up in my dad s bed  i had no memory of getting there   people were confused  my girlfriend just thought i had had too much to drink and was being dramatic  my brother thought so too  i heard them talking as i woke up   i walked into the living room and said   not cool  guys  to my sisters   i needed an ambulance  i thought i was dying   they apologized  i went back to bed   i slept most of the next day and when i woke up my son s mother was giving me sideways glances and i was feeling very upset  i felt like my family were so scared of me that they wouldn t even callhelp when i needed it  i was hurt and embarrassed  i confronted her about the looks and she says she wasnt doing anything and my family was getting ready to leave to go shopping  so i said   look everyone ive been feeling really bad lately and i feel like im getting on everyone s nerves  what is going on  she  pointing at my sons mom  is giving me bad looks all day and i went through tge scariest episode in my life yesterday  why is everyone acting this way     my mom said that everyone is afraid of me  she was trying to find a place for my sisters to live and so was my son and his mother  they all wanted away from me   i ll save you all a lot of trouble   i said and walked to my truck   i got in and i hear my mom say lucy is going to call the cops if i leave and tell them im going to hurt myself  i didn t care  i was taking all of my hurt and confusion and i was leaving  i had planned to hang myself  but i didnt tell anyone that    i soon realized after i left that i left everything at home  my phone  my wallet  i didn t have supplies to go through with this so i waited a few hours and drove back home  everyone was gone  the house was locked up  i try every door and realize at this point i never really planned on killing myself  why was i back here if i did  why would i need my phone or my wallet  just fucking do it already you whiny piece of shit   i hear a door open  its my dad  i say i have no gas or anything and i have no where to go  he says   you can t stay here   and extends a     bill  take what you need and don t come back  i did   i slept in my truck cab for two days and now i m at my grandfather s house and last i heard  i m still not welcome   i kbow that this is my fault  but i am more alone than i have ever been  i dont want to reach that place where all i can do is follow through with my plans to die     can anyone offer me advice   i have therapy appointments in two days  i am getting help  but what about everything else ,0

t3_dlopgi,CherryTomato00,feeling helpless yet again ,in the past i ve tried on multiple occasions to go to college  all my attempts miserably failed  i just can t seem to engage in long term projects as it drains me out of my emotional energy really fast    this beginning of school year i started going to college again in a vain attempt to have a reachable goal in my life  but i feel like i m starting to repeat the same pattern as before   starting the school year motivated  hoping i will finally meet new people i will be comfortable enough with so i can stop playing it off as someone i am not    i currently have some friends now  and i m not doing so bad at school  but i m starting to realise that even if everything were to be perfect  i will always find a way to isolate myself from others and to stop me from reaching my goals  if i had any to begin with    i m the one doing that to myself  not keeping in touch with friends  thinking i would never have the intellectual capacities to have an education or any jobs  wanting to physically hurt myself and abusing medication because that s the only way i can stop my brain from thinking too much  overanalyzing the tiniest details in people s behavior just because i want to know if they appreciate me  but most of the time i feel like they talk to me just out of pity    finally  i have to say i think about suicide a lot  even though i don t think i will ever do it  at least not for now   it just reassures me knowing there s an exit to my tiresome suffering  just in case i couldn t take it anymore   i m sorry for the long post but i have no one to talk to about those thoughts that keep me company almost       also english is not my first language so i apologize for any mistakes  and if any of you gets to the bottom of this post  thank you for taking the time to read it  i wish you a good and happy life ,1

t3_dlaf72,venthrowawayyy,i don t feel like i can do this anymore,     was the worst year of my life  i spent it alone with my self esteem and worth in the gutter  it was really the first time i was depressed and it was awful  looking back on my childhood  depression would explain a lot  but it went from a minor nuisance that i had never even picked up on to a life destroying monster that left me spending entire days in bed   i had friends and family but none of them have ever been close with me  yeah  i interact with them both but i ve never had a real relationship with any of them  my family generally dislikes me and friends have never really supported me in any way beyond casual appreciation  that didn t change until early       when i met somebody new   within a week we were together and every day after that was spent madly in love  it was the first time i could open up and feel safe  she struggled with everything i did  so we kept each other afloat for a while and she gave me more than a reason to live  she was perfect and my everything until a few weeks ago   she broke up with me because she felt a reltionship was stressing her out  we were still on good terms  remaining friends with plans to end up getting back together  even though i was assured that it was temporary  i sunk back into a depressed state which was now much more severe since i knew what i was missing out on   things we fine between us until we got in an argument  i was stressed and venting and upset and i guess i had been doing that too much because she turned on me real quick  calling me toxic and calling out a lot of negative things about me  we re still talking but it s clear that we ve hurt each other   i have never felt more like garbage and it hurts bad  i have hurt coming from every angle  i ve lost my friends slowly over the last few years but now  i have absolutely nobody and nothing for support  i hate that i m back to crying myself to sleep every night and being plagued with nightmares  i hate myself for screwing everything up and being a bad person   i m starting to feel numb and tired to anything and i just don t feel like i have it in me to go any further in life  i m a toxic person and knowing that stings   to anybody reading this  thanks for letting me vent  i ve run out of places to turn but i guess typing into this void helps for now  i have absolutely nothing else to rely on anymore ,0

t3_dktfov,Caraysa,idk  just a mess these days,so these days i am thinking about suicide a lot again  the first thing i thought this morning was why i was still alive and how i could end it  i tried to replace it with a good memory but yeah idk  the whole day i tried to make it a good day with singing to good songs  showering  cleaning the litter box and else  but it didnt work  i maybe looked like having a good time but the whole time i just had this pain in my chest and the will to die  i am also trying to reconnect to some people again because i isolated myself a lot and all i feel is insecure and hate about myself  actually i want to return that i wrote them  nothing bad happened  but we will see us soon and i am scared because i am just so fucked up and annoying and dumb  i just want to sleep  it s      am  but my shitty brain just thinks about how shit i am and what could happen when i meet my friends and stuff  idk  i am a mess  i just want it to end    i cant take this pain and these thoughts anymore,1

t3_dkvg2y,o49980,why ,why do we try to understand things as humans  what s the point of anything if everything we ever do will eventually be destroyed without any trace  what s the point of trying to do anything if it will never matter in the long run  plus  we are only a combination of tiny particles defined as  life   most people just learn things  get a job  maybe have kids  and eventually retire  and maybe if you are lucky enough to discover something or create something big you can get famous  but eventually everything dies  and as much as we try to figure out how everything in the universe works  we will either kill ourselves by mistake while trying or die from the heat death of the universe  still not knowing everything that we could possibly know  so really  why even try ,1

t3_dlc0br,passion4ass,risk vs  reward   wellbutrin ,good evening from california  hope you all had a great weekend  this is one of the few posts i ve made to reddit  so i apologize if i m making errors with how i address this  but i was hoping to gather some advice from people with more experience than i have  i was originally put on wellbutrin about a year ago for my anxiety   idk what they were thinking lmao   but i quit taking it about   months ago due to a mental fog i feel like i developed and also a grand mal seizure   although i did do heavy drinking the night before  i know  big no no  i was otherwise sober for the treatment   but the honeymoon phase was phenomenal for me  i found a new love for life i never knew i could have  since coming off of it  i ve had some life changing events that furthered my pre existing mild depression into a severe one which i m having a harder time coping with each day  nothing brings joy  sex drive is chatting with satan in hell s depths  i feel terribly unwanted  and i ve lost this charming confidence i used to be praised for  the seizure thing is obviously the biggest draw back from maybe trying it again  but i really think that it made me a better  and happier person   i d like to talk to my doctor about this and figure out an optimal method of addressing this  but i m worried of having my drivers license stripped away  or being blacklisted from using it regardless of my misuse with alcohol the night before the seizure      additional info i may have skipped   i was on    mg for two months before being bumped to    mg    the seizure occurred about a month and a half after being bumped to    mg     my low sex drive is affecting a potential relationship i m building with somebody i care very much about  my name on reddit holds no meaning anymore        i m a    year old male      i have tried zoloft  but only felt lazy and the thought of feeling lazy just added to my anxiety   depression       my apologies for the lengthy post  just seeking advice from people who may have been in the same boat or can offer some insight into my situation  if you ve made it this far  thank you so much for your time reading  i really do appreciate it  i look forward to hearing from you guys  i find myself peaking in here just to be amazed by the community you guys have established here ,0
t3_dli5oj,Debbie1300,love is not real ,it s a quote i live by everyday because my life couldn t any better and i feel like i drag anyone down because i ll never be good enough  i m so alone and miserable in darkness and there  will be no real life human connection out there for me just pure pity in how pathetic i am and how no one would ever want me need me or care for me because i can t imagine that  i m so boring and dull not even energetic because i don t do anything and i always thought maybe i deserve to be alone but it kills me a lot inside and i always hide it and it s also making me lose the ability to be high functioning  happy and to feel like myself again  sure some might say life is great when you have no one to look forward to and to spend time with because its ok to be alone and do good without anyone but for me it s not  i don t depend on anyone nor want to because no one takes me seriously   but it would be good to have someone  unfortunately i don t because people are far too busy and careless to even notice me love me or even hangout with me  the more i depend on wanting love from someone the farther its gets away from me because i ll always be attached to it by paying attention to it  love is hard to believe even though its mentioned a lot  because it s so complicated and annoying yet keeps you crawling back for it then drops you down like your worthless and i know i am  experiencing love would be nice and is a magnificent wonderful thing but instead i have hatred towards it because how much i ve been so poorly treated over the years  desires and expectations aren t met when it comes to love and therefore i don t care because when someone acts like they love me i don t believe them because they really don t  love for me is painful  and dreadful to deal with goes with how many times i ve been worthless and less appreciated not needed   i can t erase the fact that most people have someone except for me  which makes me feel worthless and unattractive and left out cause i m so average like who could ever like a girl like me  i m treated like trash  why even grab attention when i can t even flirt and besides i always feel the need to better up myself every time i m around a guy or want a guy  guys are just so picky and want a specific type of girl  same with me but opposite  people in society have it so easy to attract a guy or girl to be with and i end up being the one that all guys want to go away from and find someone better  people i know think i will find someone one day to spend the rest of my life with creating a false hope for me that will never come true  i could wait and wait a long time and i guaranteed no guy will ever like me  they d probably be busy  taken or cheat on me  depending on one and expecting one is a waste of time and i believe they can never satisfy a girl like me unless they think i m worth it which i m not  they rather a girl that is confident  sweet  kind well dressed flawless etc they make the effort  besides i m a complete failure and people manage their life and issues and do good better than i do and so i doubt think i will ever be ready for anyone,0

t3_dl8zpw,GrumpyRapt0r,thoughts kicked back up by an argument,i ejected myself from my friend group of   years after an argument with one member that essentially invited everyone to a party and then left me out  no one mentioned it to me and apparently there was a conversation about whether i was invited or not but no one else really fought for me despite knowing it was sort of messed up to do so  so after questions asked and various explainations essentially the  friend  having the party didn t invite me because he wanted to invite a person that caused alot of grief for me last year  essentially he s made it clear he s always going to choose this person over me no matter what  the thing is there s several accounts of the things that transpired between me and this person   but the  friend  has avoided the main issue   the fact that he didn t invite me and it felt sort of shitty to not even be told  and also an agreement between me and everyone else that s met him that on an emotional level he lacks alot of consideration for anyone elses well being  all things i ve brought up in a peaceful way initially   because his opinion of this person is so strong he s been trying to gaslight me   somehow telling me that what i feel and what i went through isn t real  despite his own friends confirming that as well as several other people around  the thing is he wouldn t ask anyone when i told him that all the proof he needs is in anyone else s account of the matter because their perception will match up with mine  making it clear that i m not the crazy one  with every mention of that he d just not address it but still persist that i connect with this other person that really put me through a situation of isolation when i was grieving and was just overall an asshole to me  this entire conflict caused me so much grief  and while i understand that no one is obligated to partake in a conflict that they don t want to  i kept telling the other friends what was going on and wrong it was  and they agreed at one point only  and stayed silent every other time  the midst of another obvious unfair treatment against me they wouldn t stand up  i was going to meet up with everyone all together at some point to hash it out again   but i decided i had explained enough already and the main person i was having the conflict with just refused to listen to me  he wrote me off as crazy despite any of my evidence  and so i decided it wasn t worth the sleep i was losing trying to come up with more evidence to disprove that  and cut him and everyone else off for just letting it happen  as much as i love them and maybe they were just afraid or soemthing  i was constantly saying that i didn t feel listened to   i was constantly making the extra mile to get them to say anything at all  i was constantly let down by them   it s funny because i kept mentioning how we literally all agreed that coming to him with anything personal is a bad idea because anything he says just makes us feel worse or the situation feel worse and maybe he should have a bit of introspection about that  and that s exactly what he ended up doing because i felt so fucking gaslighted that i ve been questioning myself and contemplating just ending it cause i see a pattern of situations in my life like this one  and my bf and alot of other people around me tell me i m sane  but considering it was a pretty important friendship to me and no one really ever answered when i called for help  i can t help but wonder if i really am  or contemplate not living lmao  considering this is one of many shitty friendships i ve had in my life where i ve obviously been fucked over  and when i defend myself and others people either go against me or dont listen  i m just sort of tired of never being heard  never having friends that are really there for me  you know ,0

t3_dla4ge,helpinghand113321,helping my friend,i ve been trying to help my friend get through suicidal thoughts and to become more positive but it s hard especially knowing they don t want too that badly  he hates knowing that it causes me stress but i m going to be stressed regardless if i help or don t  he doesn t want to see a professional or be on meds and i ve been the one who asks him in depth to know how he s feeling otherwise he wouldn t tell me willingly what s going on  i m giving it my best but i can t help someone who doesn t want to be helped right  i want to be their friend still and it s killing me either way and will cause me stress and anxiety whether i m helping or not  i feel like it s just gonna be worse off on my own mental health if i m trying and nothing works or if i m trying and it works  and then he falls into these thoughts again it s a lifelong cycle  what can i do ,1
t3_dlhscj,alisonnes,depressed or just lazy ,first off  i m aware no one here can tell me if i m depressed or not   neither can i  so that s why i want to hear others experiences by creating this post  to see if i should seek help    i apologize in advance for the really long post  but hopefully someone is willing to read it  and hopefully they can somewhat relate        the past few months  probably even longer  i ve felt awful  a little backstory about me    i m almost    and a big part of my life i took online classes  and didn t attend public school  i tried a couple of times at age      and now    to attend a public school  last year i started at a new school right before summer vacation  i made some  best  friends  turned out they were both very toxic  and after months of being belittled  called ugly  left outside etc  i cut off all contact with them  and it felt amazing in the moment    now  it isn t all that great  all of that happened about a  year  ago  now i m not in school anymore  because i honestly just stopped going altogether    here s where the depression comes in     i don t have any friends  at all  i talk to no one  and i m home all day everyday  and i haven t hung out or interacted with anyone my age for the entire time since i stopped going to school  with no one  i truly do mean no one    i like being alone  i always have   but i don t like being lonely  and there s a massive difference  being lonely is the most suffocating feeling ever  and i don t know how to get better    everyone tells me   talk to people  initiate conversations  join a club  basically  a lot of people have been saying  just make new friends  as if it s that easy  my problem isn t social interactions  i personally think i do fine with that  how am i supposed to join clubs  though  when i can t even get out of bed in the morning   now  i m just at home       i watch some netflix  play some video games  or just lay in bed on the couch every single day  even the smallest of tasks are unbearable  i have a dog  and walking him is the most impossible thing ever  just getting ready will drain all of my energy   just taking on my shoes  getting up and making food for myself  even if it s just toast or cereal  is unbearable  showering  getting out of bed in the morning  it s all impossible     to some  that might just seem like typical teenager behavior   but personally it s stopping me from enjoying my life  it s difficult at any age to not have friends  but my teenage years is something i ll never forget  and being alone and depressed in them  is not something i want to remember them by     i m not sad  just kind of empty  like i have no motivation  no motivation to do anything at all  i can t concentrate on anything  and i can t do stuff i used to enjoy  i have nothing to look forward to  at all  it s been getting a lot worse the past month  a lot worse  to the point where i can t do anything an entire day  because i just don t know where or how to start  i feel like i m always tired  and on the verge of breaking  i feel everything and nothing at the same time  i can lay and stare and do nothing for hours and hours on end  and then a wave of extreme emotions will wash over me  and i ll probably cry  because i feel so shitty and helpless       btw     my dad was diagnosed with depression last year  and from what he s told me and my family  it s exactly how i feel  i know my family would be supporting  as we re a lot that has struggled with mental health   but i feel like i might just be overreacting  and i wouldn t want to seek help if that s the case   but i truly am doing awful    my question is now  based on you guys experiences with depression  does it sound to you like i m just being lazy  or do you think i should seek help  the waitlist here to a therapist or psychiatrist is pretty long  and can take as much as   months to see one     i know some people would just tell me to get my shit together and push myself to do all the things i m having trouble with ,0
t3_dlt31k,spookybro11,i tried to kill myself but couldn t finish the job,i ve been having a shitty month my anxiety and depression have been really bad lately and tonight i was just done with it  i ve been clean from self harm for a week but i can never seem to get past a week  i was sick of feeling so negative all the time and never being happy or ok so i took a bunch of advil and started cutting myself pretty deep  this was a few hours ago and i feel like i could pass out at any moment  i didn t tell anyone despite having supportive friends because i feel like a burden on them  i hope i dont wake up in the morning ,1

t3_dluhai,SirJinPai,i m to scared to talk to anyone,i m basically very depressed and all day i can barely understand what the teacher is saying because my head is so clogged with random thoughts of suicide and stuff and my parents know a little about this but they really only know about my adhd and they think that s the only problem with me and i m guessing i look pretty sad too because several social workers that work at are school always ask me if i m ok and i always day yes because i m to afraid to talk to someone i ve also had lots of problems finding friends i had some last year but we haven t talked since and now my only friends are online or in different country s thanks for reading this if you did i just needed some place to rant ,0

t3_dldgg9,throwaway487921,i feel like no one cares about me and that i m pointless ,  m  freshman in college    i feel invisible and undeserving of people s attention  and when people do notice me  like one of my five friends here  i have to put on a facade to make it seem like everything is ok  when in reality this is the most  depressed  i ve been    yeah i talk to my parents and i know they care about me but outside them i feel like i don t exist  i just go through the motions of college  and for what  just so i can get a job  get paid  and now be lonely with money   social interactions are draining too  i can bear it for maybe a few seconds  but then i start getting anxious because of how much thinking i have to do about what to say just to keep the other party from thinking i m some sort of weirdo    i have absolutely no confidence in myself when it comes to non academic things  i always think that i m fat and ugly  so no one could possibly stand to be around me  i talk so little now that my jaw keeps locking from not being used    on top of all that  i feel like a fraud  i m studying math and cs  and i just feel like i ve cheated my way through life  and that i don t actually know anything  i guess it s part of the imposter syndrome from going to a good college    this all sounds like a rant but i m doing my best to convey how i m feeling right now  it probably doesn t count as depression since i swing between some happiness and this feeling a lot  but i ve been feeling this way for several weeks ,0

t3_dlgnr0,DepressedSasuke,suicidal thoughts are back with a vengeance  having a hard time pushing them away ,i attempted suicide in july after a person that i was very close to crossed a line and told me to kill myself   now i ve battled with depression and self harm since i was around the age of     and battled suicidal thoughts since     this however had been the first time i really went for it  i ended up being taken to the hospital and landed in the icu where i lied my way through it and said i took all those pills in a tired haze  they bought it and sent me home after i was clear   now its months later and i feel worse than ever  i have no one i m close to  the last person i had just gave up on me and i feel so alone  i can t check myself into a rehab or sorts because it would probably make me lose my job so i m just here contemplating the purpose of living when dying is clearly the better choice    i ve got nothing else to persuade myself otherwise ,0

t3_dl9x4g,fawcette,i do not know what i am supposed to be doing ,i don t know whether i am depressed or not  sometimes it feels like it and other times not  the point of this post is for me to reach out to anyone for advice on what exactly i am supposed to be doing  it feels like i have nowhere to go and nothing to do  i am in my fourth year of university  studying political science  i fucking hate it  i love to read books and write about them in my journal  i love learning and studying  i love reading about what these great men and women throughout history have said about whatever topic  about philosophy  in a broad sense   the law  politics  etc etc  i love it  university has made it impossible for me to enjoy any of these things anymore  i thought i wanted to be a lawyer but i have no idea anymore  it feels like i am being forced to pursue law  or any workfield that requires a university degree  but there is no one explicitly forcing me to do such a thing  but the feeling is there  it is as though if i do not do this i will not do anything in life  that there is no purpose  but pursuing law does not even give me purpose either  i just wanted it to give me purpose  i wanted something to give me purpose  i have all of these assignments due shortly and i do not want to do any of them  and the thought of having to do them makes me want to kill myself  that is not being dramatic  maybe a little  but i mean that the feeling of killing myself is surfacing because of these pressures i feel from university  and all of these responsibilities that i could care less about  this is all rambling  i just feel like i am going to give up because i have no other option  i do not feel joy about the things i once felt joy for  i feel smothered  i feel lost  that is it mainly  i feel lost  i have nowhere to go  and i am doing school only because it seems like the normal thing to do  but i fucking hate it  i hate it  what else am i supposed to do  where do i go  i want to call it a crisis but  i am reluctant to do so  has anyone felt anything similar  if so  i would love to hear that i am not alone  or advice  thank you ,0

t3_dlk8w9,Helpmehelpsomeone2,how do i convince someone that life can be worth living  that things will get better ,a friend of mine is going through depression  it s gotten to a very bad point  unfortunately the only thing i could do  is convince her that things will get better and life is worth living  other than that  whether she ends up killing herself is out of my hands it seems  although i would blame myself for it     i have had a long history of depression myself  so i know for a fact that things get better  sometimes things will get worse  but then it will again get better   whenever i try to convince her of that  she ll say that  i don t want to get better  i just want to die   the conundrum in that is that if she starts feeling better  she wouldn t be angry about being happy and not wanting to die anymore   it doesn t help that she s bullied a lot at school for no reason other than kids being evil  she get s called names like  w      e  daily and her  friends  keep telling her to kill herself    from her perspective i guess the world is an evil place  i have tried to be a beacon of hope for her  but i m starting to fear that i m not bright enough to shine out all the darkness ,0
t3_dldv37,Random-user12,i m suicidal but i don t know how to tell anyone   rant ,i ve been suicidal for three years with short periods where i wasn t in those three years   my family is the main reason i m suicidal but i just can t bring myself to tell them that  i love them so much but i just feel like such a burden  i act like the perfect child i get good grades  never get into fights  and finish majority of my work  but lately it s been getting harder and harder to keep going on with my life  i had another period where i wasn t suicidal recently and i felt so happy but it didn t last long  it never does   i m a bit better than i was a year ago   i would have a mental breakdown to myself almost every night   but recently it s escalating back to that point   the only reason i haven t committed suicide yet is because my disabled sister is going to need me to support her in the future  if she wasn t here i would probably already be gone ,1
t3_dke5mf,HailTallulah,i want to die soon  but knowing how ugly i ll look stops me ,you don t need to bother responding  someone else could use the help more than i do   i survived a weak suicide attempt in may  took half a bottle of painkillers that turned out to be expired  and was in a psych unit for a week  now i want to do something respectable  but my ugliness stops me   i m an ugly woman  i was only useful to anyone when i was     and would show off my body to grown men  i was ugly  and everyone my age always gravitated away from me  i don t know why they wouldn t  weird brown chick with a dead mom  poor trailer trash  an awkward  unfeminine beast  but when i came home from school  i knew how to get online and show off for pedophiles  so i had some company  some use   now i m    and fat  with a shitty gpa  and a trail of failed online relationships behind me  all people i ve manipulated  cheated on or hurt somehow  i graduate soon but i just don t want to live  i don t deserve it  i had no childhood  no adolescence  no foundation  i don t want to grow up   i m a wet hoarder  hoarding trash  even less hygienic  attracting bugs and allergens  and i m fucking disgusting  i lost   lbs last year but gained most back after may s psych meds  even though i quickly discontinued them   i can t die like this  so i m going to fast for atleast    hrs  clean up my hoard  and try to make myself less appalling  then i m going to take all those psych meds i have leftover  and finally have a respectable overdose    it s kind of exciting though  life is like a dream  it s going to end soon  so i m going to let myself pretend sometimes that i m a person  that i m not an evil ugly cunt who deserves death  and just try to imagine what my life would ve been if i was a better person  then maybe i ll die happy  even though i won t deserve it ,1

t3_dl4xaw,ashes1436,is it true that i wouldn t talk about suicide if i were actually going to go through with it ,my timeline for taking my life is shortening due to something outside of my control  i was trying to talk to my partner about knowing if it is best to stay or go early enough that i can find housing before it is too late  i figured out  in my own head  that if i do not figure it out in time i may need to kill myself  he told me if i were going to do it  i would have done so  it would be cool to know this is true  but i do not feel comfortable planning on this when i don t have the research behind it ,1

t3_dkz43a,throwaway_729100,i don t want to live anymore ,i thought there was supposed to be a week long holiday for us year   s in early november  turns out it s not a holiday and we have to go to school for self study  there won t even be any classes  which means that we have to trudge all the way back to school to do something we can do at home   i was devastated when i found out from a friend  i know it s petty to be this upset over something so trivial  but right now i m in my second year of ib and extremely stressed and depressed  i am not someone who can handle stress well and the workload is overwhelming me  i self harmed again a couple weeks ago  something i haven t done in three years  then i started thinking about suicide again  how nice i would be to die and leave all this shit behind   i tried to hang myself last year   the only thing that kept me from doing anything harmful to myself was to constantly remind myself i d get a break two weeks later  and i can spend time resting and looking after myself  it was the only thing that kept me going when i wanted to die from having to complete so many assignments in a very short span of time  and now   even that has been taken away from me   when my friend broke the news  it honestly felt as if the world was crashing down around me  naturally  i responded badly to that and he got annoyed  he probably thinks i m a spilt brat who gets her own way and can t deal with any changes  i m honestly just depressed and burnt out and i really need a break  i go to the toilets halfway through my classes just to fucking cry  dragging my ass out of bed and to school every morning is almost impossible for me  i want to stay in the comfort for my own home and escape from reality for a bit  to sleep all day and not have to do anything  nothing interests me anymore  i used to love writing and my work amazed people who read it  now i struggle to write a small paragraph and the quality of my writing is low  when i could have easily written pages and pages before  i seem like a cheerful carefree person on the outside  but those are the last things i am  even the happiness i felt at having being given an offer by the fucking university of bristol was brief  since i keep worrying that it was somehow a mistake  and that the university would soon contact me saying they mixed me up with another person and i shouldn t have received an offer  even if it isn t a mistake it s just a conditional offer and my real ib score is going to be so low that i ll ultimately get rejected    now i just feel so   empty  i have nothing to look forward to any longer    i wish i were dead ,1

t3_dl4ji0,23965A,social anxiety makes a normal life seem impossible  and suicide viable,i ve had some degree of social phobia for pretty much my entire life  but it s gotten steadily worse over the past few years  to the point where almost any interaction with another person   or even the prospect of it   inspires a deep  soul wrenching dread  and near panic attack levels of anxiety  i made it through college by avoiding as much social contact as i could  i literally went weeks without talking to anyone  including my roommates  i had five different housemates in three years of college  and i don t think i exchanged more than a few words with any of them  most times i couldn t even bear being in the same room with them  i went to the grocery store at five in the morning to avoid crowds  and i seldom shopped anywhere that didn t have self checkout machines   i was and still am afraid to respond to e mails and texts  even ones from my parents   i feel like my life is over  basically  i graduated college with a b a  despite never talking to a single professor  including my senior thesis adviser  but i m scared to death of having even a menial job  interviews terrify me  and just looking for work on the internet is enough to get my anxiety going  i started seeing a new therapist a few weeks ago  but i m not sure it s helping  i do the things she asks me to do  or at least some of them  but the anxiety hasn t really dissipated  each new task  each interaction   and these are simple  laughably innocuous things  like buying a drink from a convenience store  or ordering coffee at starbucks   fills me with the same sense of dread  a feeling that makes my heart race and my stomach churn  and  though i m being totally truthful here  i tend to minimize the extent of my anxiety in conversations with therapists and my parents  i m deeply embarrassed by the fact that i struggle so heavily with things most people wouldn t think twice about  things that elementary school aged kids could probably do with ease  i can t help but picture myself at     at     at     wasting away in my parents  house  living off a goodwill probably fostered by their suspicion  not unwarranted  that if they kick me out  i ll immediately kill myself  or at least starve to death when i can t summon up the courage to walk into a soup kitchen   reading this back  i m not sure why i wrote it  except to vent  i m painfully aware that there are no easy solutions to social anxiety this bad  and i don t expect people on reddit  especially people with their own problems that no doubt match or surpass mine in terms of severity  to provide what two years of therapy and a slew of medications couldn t  maybe someone else with social anxiety can take solace in the fact that they aren t the only person suffering in this particular way  i ve noticed that most online suicide prevention resources emphasize depression at the exclusion of other  similarly debilitating mental illnesses  and i hate to think that other suicidal social phobics might feel invalid as a result  i don t have any plans to kill myself yet  but whenever i think about my future  when i think about what my life might be like two or three years down the line  i sometimes feel like suicide is my only option  it s just so hard for me to imagine existing long term in a world where a baseline level of sociability is more or less necessary for a half decent  self sufficient life ,1

t3_dlpu27,swannnsonggg,i am only remaining alive so that i don t hurt my mother,but all i ve done since i ve gotten depressed is make my mother sad  she is clearly more depressed than she was a few years ago  as my asshole sister made abundantly clear to me when she tried to  convince me to stop being depressed   my mom never did anything wrong  and  in fact  she did a lot right  she has been the only person in my life who has always recognized when i ve been struggling and been ready to do almost anything to help me out  i know she would be decimated if i  did the bad thing     the rest of my family have been very distant  they only really recognized cared about how i was feeling when i failed in college    years after i started becoming very isolated and depressed  i have not spoken to a single person i met from ages       since i left school  i would literally sit at the dinner table in near silence everyday unless spoken to for about   years  i didn t receive a single pep talk from any of them during this period  i don t know whether or not to blame this on their character or their stupidity  they re nice enough that they don t deserve my death  but they certainly don t deserve for me to stay alive when i m suffering  sure of my decision  and ready to leave   they re decent people  but i hate being around my family  i feel like i share nothing in common with them besides blood  they have no interest in the outside world or anything that takes time and energy to grasp or understand  despite being in the top    globally of people who have the opportunity to do that  it s work sports television and repeat  they are wilfully stupid and unhappy people  the only things i ever feel i have in common with my family are my faults  stupidity  sensitivity  and indifference  it would be alot easier for me to maintain a distant but workable relationship with my family if i wasn t depressed  but i don t feel a desire to do it like i used to    i m probably a drug addict  i usually take modest doses of amphetamines  kratom  and alcohol everyday compounded by an unholy amount of nicotine  i ve tried being sober  and it s extremely disappointing  it s as if i can see how shitty my life is more vividly  but no will to change anything about it returns to me at all  i can t think clearly or remember things like i could just a few years ago  and i m making it worse everyday  i ve tried     medications from my psychiatrist    therapists  rtms  self administered ketamine therapy  exercise  etc  nothing helps at all  not even enough for me to bother continuing with it   i feel like such a piece of shit  and i think that s because i am  i know so many of you must have abusive non existent cruel families and many would do anything for a family that would love you unconditionally  i might have something like that  but it doesn t make me feel good  i only cause worry and sadness for my family when i m living  and yet i would make things worse if i ended my life  i wish i could use one of those memory erasers from men in black on all of them and then jump under a train  i hate myself and i hate this world ,1
t3_dle4m7,RapidboIII,watching my brother kill himself infront of me,hello reddit this is my first post on reddit and right now i m slowly comprehending my brothers suicide and was maybe seeing if anyway has experienced something as horrible as i have  forgive my formatting i am on mobile  so might as well jump into it    i will begin with my brother and my relationship  my brother is   years older than me and he always looked out for me in more ways than i will ever know and ways i am finding out from his friends he loved me more than i ever knew and probably more than i know now  my parents have always argued for as long as i can remember since before i was in preschool and my brother would do his best to shield it from me and he would shield me from my parents toxic parenting habits by taking their positive traits and enforcing those on me acting as third parents in my life essentially   we also were friends growing up constantly playing with neighborhood kids and just spending time together and just teaching me things and letting me experience life on my own at the same time  he would always be there for me no matter what and always understand my thought processes given how weird and different they are but he would understand my true intent and he was honestly the only person who could do that  as we grew older into our teens we got a little more distant him gaining high school friends and being more social while me struggling through middle school but he still cared for me the same we then grew up more his twenties and my late teens  our level of maturity was finally equalizing and i was realizing why he did things the way he did when he was my age and slowly comprehending his thought processes bringing us even closer  when i was a younger teen he brought me to hang out with his friends who took a liking to me and bringing us back to current day his friends happened to be my friends and we would all hang out and just do things together and me and my brother were friends in the group who happened to be brothers and i never would invite myself to things if they wanted me there they would let me know and they did a lot that s how i knew they were friends with me because they would hang out with me even while my brother was busy doing other things and i was available  of course there is the brother bond that we had  for us that was being each others other half mentally he would be a very logical thinker meanwhile i would be very logical but emotionally charged as well and i had a lot less common sense than he did and we just had a dynamic that was easy for people who met us together for a half hour would be able to see the level of closeness we had    i would keep rambling on about how close we were but this post is gonna be long don t need to make it any longer so now let s go into background of my brothers past and what my parents would not let him live down   when my brother was a young teen he finally started to think for himself and be able to argue things and he was good at it  my parents did not like that especially my father who when my brother was a young teen throttled him into a wall  a throughout the years my brothers relationship with my parents after that degraded more and more emotionally and physically  when my brother had finally graduated high school he started dating his first love who eventually broke his heart after that he had been smoking weed and he started doing acid and other harder drugs i still don t even know about  my parents eventually found this when he upgraded his phone and went through his old phone and saw the messages rookie mistake to keep the messages   and my parents just started verbally abusing my brother even more because he was depressed and failing school blowing through his college fund and using his job money to barely pay his car insurance and the rest for drugs and food  eventually though my brother turned his life around and started doing much better for himself  he got a full time job being decently paid for someone his age without a bachelors  he was going to school on the side paying for everything and never asking for money  he was a straight a student everyone at his job loved him and new him as a real guy who meant what he was saying and did good and put a      into everything he did  he has a dog that they got him as a christmas present two years ago and he wanted to train the dog to be a well trained dog he would pay for sessions try himself and do other things to make him a well behaved dog  but my mother wouldn t follow the training at all completely derailing all the effort my brother put in and hurting him deeply because he was still depressed and struggling through life trying to find happiness and his only reason to live was that dog    now getting into the day before he decided to do it    i was in my room working on an assignment eating my favorite candy which is also his he asked for one and i gave it to him then he swiped the bag from me so we started running around the house both holding onto the bag him trying to pull it away and me trying to get it back  the dog could not decipher the difference between play and threat and bit but this wasn t like the other times he had done this he had broken skin and gone a bit deep and made my brother bleed  so my brother started reprimanding the dog as that is      not ok to do because if he did that to some stranger he would be put down in our jurisdiction at least  my mom hearing the commotion came out of her room and asked what was happening he explained and she started yelling at my brother for  abusing  the dog  which started a heated argument and at this point i had my candy and had to finish this assignment bc it was due at midnight it was   so i did not know how long it would take so i went back to working on it  i finished the assignment about    minutes later  they were still arguing and at the beginning of the argument my dad had been on his side now the argument had turned to mainly my dad and my brother arguing and my father started verbally attacking my brother with some bullshit claims so i joined the argument defending my brother which my dad then started targeting me but at a young age my dad taught me the bad habit of how to immediately cut a person down at their core and verbally destroy them and me and my brother do not share many details of our personal life to them but we know many things about them so we can completely stop our parents in our track because my dad was trying to do this to us  so me and my brother started tag teaming my dad destroying him verbally  pervs  and my dad couldn t argue with us anymore so he got physical pushing my brother out of the room  my brother is older than me but is slightly shorter and a lot skinner i am a few inches taller and a lot more heavy set  he then tried to the same to me and my brother immediately said if you put your hands on him it ll be the last thing you do so my dad threw what i can only describe as the girliest punch ever at my brother and after that we realized he put hands on both of us  or at least tried to me  so i went to call     and my mother the maniac she is said that she would tell the police we hit him and that she would put us in jail so we decided it would not be worth it to make the call and kept arguing  the law system is fucked around here so we would be the ones fucked and he would get off scott free  so then my dad lock their door and at this point my brother is sick of not being able to train his dog and wants to give it away and then move out  so he argues with them to give them his dog so he can put it in a better home away from them and him so he can be a happy dog  he sits at their door arguing for about an hour as i occasionally chime in  eventually he gives up and comes into my room saying he is done and out of motivation and he has lost his only reason to live and was genuinely done with life  i pleaded and cried at his beside for   hours while he just sat there emotionless saying he would do it in two days  he would take the next day off of work find a place to adopt his dog then give me his last paycheck and ticket to a musical festival he was going to then off himself i eventually couldn t find anything else to plead with and had given up and was trying to think of friends to talk to before just shoving him in a hospital   now comes the day in my life i will never forget and never be able to stop feeling the pain from   btw i love you and thank you for reading through my ramblings of a broken teen and sorry for all the grammar errors english is not my strong suit it was his  mine is math his wasn t  like i said two halves of a whole    my brother wakes me up having gotten his dog out to the room and being dressed for work and telling me  hey dads coming home in a half hour make sure he doesn t do anything stupid and watch blue and text me with updates i m going to work later  so i wake up tired and slightly confused but processed and started looking around went to the garage my brother had already left for work  and i saw my dad with locks he was planning on changing all the locks in the house to kick us out  i went to my mom who was in her bed and she said to me your dad wants you and your brother out and i said why  me and my brother were now not leaving out of spite   and said because you guys attacked him last night and i just made her relive the moment of what she was referring to making her realize me and my brother literally stood there with out arms crossed doing nothing my dad was the one attacking us and it clicked for her  my parents both went to work and i later in the day went to class and attend college where my mom works i stopped in her office in hopes she wasn t there to grab a water out of her mini fridge and she was there with a co worker and asked if i wanted to have lunch later  not wanting to air family drama at her place of work i said maybe depends on what i m doing after class  i texted my brother he said do it and take the small wins we can get because if we can get mom on our side we can fuck over dad  at this point we didn t really care about what my mom had said we were livid at our father   i get lunch with my mother and i am able to sway her to he on our side more and then go home to keep watch of the house because we were still uncertain if my dad were going to try anything  eventually my mom comes home later and tells me that she told my dad not to kick us out and something else i cannot remember  i tell my brother and he says alright good and informs me at the end of the month we re gonna pack all our shit up in a hurry and dip the fuck out and move in with his best friend i say ok and that i m going to spend time with my  now ex  girlfriend so i go spend time with her and come home and my brother is there and we begin to discuss things and then our dogs  i have one to but his is the main one in this story  start barking because it s around then time we usually walk them  so he says let s talk about it while we walk the dogs and i say why not go the dog park he says he wants to walk so i agree  we begin the walk and are talking and he seems to be in a better mind state and we are talking about the future so i am a lot less concerned about him killing himself    we begin to cross the street to a park we would go to  to let our dogs run around and play and as we re almost across the street my brother let s go of his dogs leash and stops and i look and see a car coming he stands in the lane it is in with his arms spread  t posing basically  and i say his name trying to get him to keep moving not realizing what he was doing the car then swerved to miss him and then jumped in front of it and went flying  he hit the asphalt and at the moment i knew my brother was dead  he did not leave a note  he didn t say anything to me  and he didn t make a sound  i only heard him get hit by the car and a few seconds later land on the asphalt  seeing what i did in that moment my brothers soul flew out his body i m sure of it    now comes my question i m still in shock over this and i am trying to come to terms with this and deal with it but it s not a thing many people or anyone i have met or the research of done on google have been through so honestly i m just struggling i know there isn t a right way to grieve but i just want help  i do have suicidal thoughts but they are not serious ones they re passing ones that fade quickly i just don t know has anyone experienced this horrible thing  i know it s fucked but if you could just share with me it would help immensely losing him was literally getting a half of myself torn off  thank you for reading i know this basically of novel filled with bad grammar and ramblings but i felt like all the details i have included are the important i stopped myself from extending this a lot more  again thank you ,1

t3_dkqhr2,ScalpWounds,i m in so much pain,so my wife and i have been having a difficult time for the past few years  we had issues with a few apartments  ended up moving in with a client who had a room for rent and needed overnight care  after he demanded more and more  we had to move in with my mom  that s where we ve been for the past   years   originally she was working a standard job  as was i  and we were doing great  we were helping my mom fix up her place and getting money saved  slowly her work started to dry up  though  and they weren t trying to keep her up on hours  on top of that  they were hiring brand new people with no experience at higher rates than her  and she had a decade of experience   she decided to start her own business after the company decided to drop a few of the clients she was working with as they were getting out of a certain area  she picked up a few  and the income was okay to start  she started looking at the future and expanding  but unfortunately that didn t happen    years later  she s looking at downsizing even more  and likely will be getting out of the business entirely   so for   years i paid all of our bills  other than a few  i didn t care  it was about letting her have her dream  i did it for her  i even went out of my way to try to help her with everything that i could    the bombshell came when she started saying she wanted to leave  and it might be without me  she had always wanted to leave the state  but this was somewhat sudden  she eventually told me the only thing holding her back from leaving has been that she s worried about me killing myself   this has sent me into a downward spiral  i m breaking down constantly  i entertain the thought of suicide constantly  i genuinely keep wondering why i haven t done it yet  but i ve been here a lot over the years  and it just never happens   i ll have been married to her for   years here soon  and we ve known each other far longer  i can t imagine life without her  i don t know that i d want that life  i just keep telling myself that she will come around  i want her to tell me we can still be together  i teally want a hug and a kiss and to be told it will all be okay  but i won t get that   i don t want to die  i want to stop existing  but that isn t feasible  also i m sorry if this is poorly formatted  i know that mobile doesn t translate well ,1

t3_dlp6nn,softcelll,i hate when people ask me why i m depressed,i never know how to answer it  my depression is not trauma related  it is not related to any one specific event in my life  unfortunately  it is just how i am   i don t think people ask  why are you depressed   with ill intentions  but it ends up feeling hurtful anyway   it makes me feel ashamed when i don t know how to answer it  i don t live in poverty  i have two parents and a loving sister  i have a few friends who really care about me  i m healthy  there s nothing specific that has made me feel this way and it makes me question why i feel so weak when clearly i am so fortunate   being depressed in itself is such a struggle for me and then i also feel the burden of being ashamed of not having a  real reason  for being like this ,0

t3_dkl4qb,Thisaintnothrowaway8,i can t tell anyone the real reason i m suicidal ,i was recently put in a psych ward for the suicidal because i was stupidly dropping major hints that i planned to kill my self in hopes that i could ask for help without destroying my pride   when i was put in there  my family blamed it on prozac  seeing as one of its side effects is suicidal thoughts   i ve talked to therapist after therapist and i told them all the same thing   but i haven t told anyone why i really wanted to kill myself  not even my closest friends   the real reason i wanted to die was because of a girl   i know it sounds stupid  but hear me out   i had known this girl for years  and have had a huge crush on her from the second i was introduced to her   many years went by  she had moved back and forth a few times   when she came back this time  i confessed my feelings for her  she said the feelings were mutual  but she wasn t ready for a relationship yet  seeing as she had just gotten out of a bad relationship  i made sure to let her know that i understood  and planned to respect that   about a month goes by and she is very flirty with me  touching me  writing me little notes  making fun of eachother  sending me hearts  etc   however  just when i think i m getting somewhere  she gets back together with her ex   they were all over eachother  their social media s filled with posts about eachother  and going on and on about eachother  the works   now not only was i fucked sideways in this situation  but she still keeps me just close enough so that these feelings can t go away  and she still does all the flirty things she did when she was single   she is the only girl i ve ever had feelings this strong for  i can t help but love her   but after a month and a half of this  it didn t sting as bad  it just made me very depressed and sick   i was starting to get over my suicidal feelings  the psych ward really helped me realize a lot    however  all of those feelings rushed back after we hung out   we grabbed a pizza  watched a movie  made eachother laugh  and went for a walk in the autumn leaves   she looked absolutely amazing  she made me happy  the entire time i was with her  i didn t have a single worry  nothing else mattered  it felt like i was in heaven   it was then i realized how much i actually love her    she told me she loved me  but it felt so hollow  as if it barely meant anything to her  i just felt so empty knowing how disposable i am   we talk often  and she says she considers me her best friend  i obviously play along  but she means far more to me than any friend ever has   we talk almost every day  we hangout at least once a week  and she still acts as flirty as she used to  but i know it ll never go anywhere   it s sad to say  but i put all my eggs in one basket  and somebody stole it   i know i sound really pathetic  but that s why i lied to everyone  i m ashamed that she is the reason i wanted to end my life   don t get it wrong  i have a life outside of her  i have friends and family and hobbies and things to be proud of  but it feels like none of that matters without her   i m truly a piece of shit  but i guess that s why i m saying this to strangers on the internet ,1
t3_dl7sj1,22ctsnahat,is their anywhere you can kill yourself to make sure your family doesn t find your body ,i know i m going to get a few comments saying that you can t control what happens after you die  but is their at least something i can do to make the chances less likely  maybe i could overdose in a forest or bathroom  but then some innocent unsuspecting person is going to get scarred for life  maybe i can call     but there is no way of knowing if they will get their too soon  i m not scared of death itself i m more just scared of how much it s going to hurt  and i don t want to live or die i just don t want to exist if that makes any sense  i know this whole post was just kind of me rambling but i just had to get it out on the table and see if anyone else is feeling the same  sorry ,1
t3_dlkwn1,longarmman68,do not seek help ,i attempted to seek help a little bit ago  worst mistake i ve made  i was so close to killing myself  and then i thought that maybe i d give it a try to seek help  so i did the only thing i havent tried yet  i went to the e r  and asked the registration lady if there was anyway they could help me find a cheap therapist   she said yes  and i even asked her  if there was anyway they could keep me from leaving  and she told me straight to my face  no matter what happens  i can leave when ever i want  fast forward    mins  and they re taking all of my belongings and they lock me in a room with only a bed in it for    hours  with no food the whole time and no opportunity to bathe or change my clothes  then a cop came  handcuffed me and put me in the back of his car and drove me to a mental hospital  on the way there  i asked him if he could crack the window cause i was getting car sick  and he said   well you should ve thought about that before you got yourself put in the back of my car  he then dropped me off and then it was in the looney bin i went    while i was there  it took me   days to speak to anyone besides a nurse  and when i did finally see a psychiatrist and a therapist  they just basically just asked me the same questions the nurses had been asking me for   day  they then gave me a discharge day and left me alone  and i tried to ask to see the therapist again  the nurses told me that they would put my name on the list to see her and she would see me as soon as possible  i asked them to put my name on the list every single day until i left  and i never saw the therapist again    so i got out yesterday  and now i lost my job and my means of transportation  and i m gonna be homeless in about   days  i told the doctors that i couldn t afford to be taken to inpatient  and they would just ignore me and some of them even walked away from me mid sentence  now i m left with an e r bill i cant pay  and a huge bill for my imprisonment at the mental facility  so now they left me with no choice  the only thing seeking help has done for me is it helped me decide that killing myself was what i should have done in the first place ,0

t3_dl5qom,Twigggins,why do i even bother ,i don t even know where to begin  i m    m  i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxeity disorder when i was    years old  but i obviously have been dealing with it since i was a pre teen in middle school  but my family is sorta traditional and mostly uneducated  so they just thought i was just emotional boy  i was also diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder when i was   years old    i believe a lot of my problems stem from the lack of a stable father figure and a very overbearing and very religious mother who would hit me with all sorts of things when she was mildly upset with me  i was always the new kid because of how often mom would move  i ve always been the bottom of the proverbial totem pole  i ve always liked girls so i would try to ask girls out in middleschool and highschool but i ve always been rejected    i d like to believe that i m not all that ugly  i m at least a       i m      i m tan  i ve been told i have very proportionate facial features  and i m in pretty decent shape  i d like to think that i m kind  honest  patient and compassionate with others  i d like to think that i m at least a little more intelligent than average  i read quite a lot  and i love history  science  philosophy and music  i can also sing and play lots of instruments  however  dealing with rejection has played a central part in a lot of my emotional turmoil  i was in a few relationships in the past   years  but they usually all end the same way  they tell me it s not my fault and just ghost me forever  i don t get it    my father isn t all that great either  i went many years as a child without seeing him  and any time he contacts me it s for me to do a favor for him  i told him i wanted to see my grandfather in brazil who was very sick and was going to die  but he went without me and i only found out that my grandpa died a few weeks after from facebook    i ve been on and off allllll sorts of different medications  some didn t even work  some worked a little too well and i would lose       lbs within a couple months    i m currently on    mg of wellbutrin  i smoke a lot of thc now  they don t help  but i feel nothing for several hours  so i guess that works   i ve attempted suicide twice  one time by hanging when i was     in which the hook i was hanging from in fact broke off from my weight and i fell and i didn t bother to try again and threw away the rope  the other time was by asphyxiation by co in my garage roughly two months ago  where my current step father tore me out of the car when he woke up to get a snack  almost as if god would like to keep me alive just to endure the pain for as long as i can until i drive myself into insanity    i ve grown increasingly cynical and pessimistic with each misfortune that comes upon me  in the same year  this one  i ve lost my car  my job  my financial aid for school  and my relationship  i got a new crummy car just to get me around now  which is a step up from vegetating in my room all day  the more my mental health deteriorates  the faster the things around me collapse  i usually just stay inside because at least not as many things can hurt me   i was alone for four months and i fell for a girl about a month ago that i had been talking to  she s perfect  but i told her my feelings and she doesn t feel the same  the sting is heavy  and i feel all alone  i m scared to attempt suicide now because i m afraid to fail and mortally injure myself and i ll either become paralyzed or die very painfully  which i would rather avoid  my track record for bad luck is pretty extensive   the worst part is  my life is just good enough where i can t complain to anyone except for faceless readers on reddit who don t read anything except for the tl dr anyway  therapy hasn t worked  medicine doesn t work  exercise doesn t work  religion doesn t work  long walks in nature doesn t work  i have a raincloud that follows me all the time and it worries my family and the people around me  at this point  i don t care who cries over my death  everyone just wants to hurt me anyways   why do i even bother   tl dr  my life is fine  which is my main gripe  i tried  i really have  but any of my attempts at happiness in myself is always crushed by people mistreating me  i know i m supposed to find love in myself  but man  i m really fucking lonely  i relate to charlie brown a lot in this regard  good grief ,0

t3_dlpfwe,fredmyevilhamster,if i don t get my degree  i m out ,i m so tired  literally all i ve lived for in the past   years is that piece of paper  if i fail the two classes i m retaking  i really am fucking worthless  i can t live with the shame and embarrassment of failing the only thing i have going for me in life  this degree is the only thing that has kept me alive  i m nothing if i don t get my degree  i have no purpose  i already manage to barely make it day to day and i just can t see myself trying anymore if i can t accomplish the one goal that actually matters  i wish i was intelligent enough  i wish i was a normal person  i wish i didn t wake up feeling crushed by the world everyday ,1
t3_dkyj28,_Anty_,i wouldn t mind,i m at a point in my life where i just don t give a shit anymore  i tried to commit suicide already  failed  was hospitalized many times  spent months in different clinics etc    i can t kill myself  but if a car would drive in my direction full speed  i wouldn t move    it s just like this   numbness i guess  i want to die  but i can t do it myself because i ve seen people react to it   so if it s an accident  who can be mad at me ,1
t3_dlvegu,hobistar,how to go from here    ,i don t really know how to start this but i have to get these words out  eventhough it makes it worse right now because i slowly realise that this is my reality   for the past few months  since around may  june  the intensity of my  sadness  has increased and for the past few weeks my motivation isn t even there anymore  i haven t been to someone that is professionalised in this field  therefore i have never been diagnosed  furthermore i also don t want to diagnose myself only because i can make out some similarities with others that have depression   but for the last few weeks it s like i am moving forward to a turning point that i cannot return back from   i have suicidal thoughts  in particular how i could end it in a way that i am sure to not fail and kinda how i can make it the cleanest way  it may sound wierd but i don t want to have anything scattered around or be unrecognisable afterward etc    it even got to this point where i can t unterstand why people try to prevent suicide  they always preach about how there is something worth living for and how people would miss you if you were gone and how much pain they have to endure  but why is it okay to keep me here and let me endure this pain  if the only thing i dearly want right now is just to sleep  i am so tired  so badly tired that i never want to leave my bed again and just sleep in for the last time so i can finally rest  isn t it selfish of them to keep me here  eventhough i just live from day to day without even wanting  wouldn t i do a favour for someone that deserves to live  someone that knows how to get themselve together  i know some can see the good things  some can see the colours around them but for me everything seems to fade  it pains not to be happy anymore and i slowly fuck everything up  i just received a spot in a university and because of the lack of motivation i can t seem to do anything slightly related for it     all the assignments i have are just stocking up  they get more and more and the more they get  the more of a failure i feel like   at first i thought it s just being a bit depressed because around some things won t work out and that the stress resulting from this is getting to me but i am not really sure anymore    i don t even know if i should seek help  because i am so aware of it all and i am scared that no one will believe me  i don t really know how to put all of this into words  i am scared that the only thing people see is someone attention seeking or some that wants to be pitied eventhough that s the least i want  the only thing i want is to rest ,0
t3_dkn7te,SalineStillness,       the best option for everyone ,is it wrong to wonder if killing myself would be the best option because my parents wouldn t have to deal with my medical bills after my death   it s not even a lot in bills  it could be so much worse  it could be  so much worse   my parents are alive and i could ask my older siblings for loans and i could just take more loans for my tuition so i really don t have anything to complain about   but i m just so fucking tired from the past month  the long story is that i got taken to the er after having a seizure on monday       slept for three days  took two midterms  took another midterm that i failed  badly  the next monday  failed to turn in a project worth      had horrible nightmares every night from levetiracetam  wanted to die every day  started crying  wanting just to sleep  or jump off a building  anything  either turned things in late or didn t turn them in because i couldn t focus  had to quit work  got another med that has sedated me so i ve been sleeping for hours  got sent       dollars in medical bills  had to drop the class i m failing because i can t do it so i ll have to take it again and i m only taking    credit hours this sem  got diagnosed with unspecified bipolar disorder and will have to up my dose of lamictal   now i have to apply for the fafsa and school scholarships and financial assistance from the hospital and i have more midterms and the class i applied to drop hasn t been officially dropped so i still need to go but there s another midterm this wednesday that i ll fail because i haven t been able to concentrate like a loser   i feel like i can t do this anymore  there is  just  enough money in my checking account from work savings to pay the medical bills but i won t have any left over for rent and food and tuition fees and i don t have a job now   the only reason i ve held on is i have a younger sister and i don t want her growing up knowing that her sister killed herself  but now it seems like it would be the right thing to do because i don t want to burden my parents by making them spend money that they don t have when my sister is so young and she needs to go to school  i just want to kill myself because i ve been burdening my friends  roommates  boss  family with this shit and i m so tired  i m tired   i don t know who else to tell because i don t want to concern my friends or parents even more and the crisis center at my school is useless and wasn t any help when i went last time yet still charged me     which is trivial but made me angry because i only went there because i was close to killing myself  i won t even be able to see a counselor i ve seen before because there were no openings and i have to wait for november to see her and even then i can only speak to her for an hour when i feel like i can t stop pouring all of this out until years later   i started writing a goodbye letter which i ve never done before even at my old lowest points  i feel weak and helpless and stupid and lazy  if i were stronger then i would be able to handle this   i keep thinking it would be the best option for me and everyone else if i just had the guts to kill myself and either my checking account would be emptied for the medical bills or my parents would just not have to pay it at all and then they could get the checking account money and save it for my younger sister  i m less and less able to think of reasons why i shouldn t do that because i m so  so  so fucking tired  it s not supposed to be my fault but i m so ashamed of being so weak and so stupid and emotional and lazy  if i were just stronger then none of this would have happened  then i would have been able to pull myself together after the seizure and just do everything i should have done   and now i ve been declared bipolar which means i m unstable and horrible and now dating will be even more impossible  and i m afraid of losing my friends once they realize how disgusting and emotional and selfish i am because of this   i just want to sleep forever and die and not have to deal with this anymore  i m so tired  i m tired and terrible  and no one needs to hear about this shit because i m stupid and this is all nothing compared to what other people have been through but god i just can t do this  i m weak  i can t do this   killing myself would end this for me  would remove the burden i am on everyone in my life  this seems like the best option for everyone i love  i don t love myself  that s not why i m still alive  i m only alive because i thought it would hurt the people around me but i know they can just get over it and then they ll never have to deal with how horrible i am   it sounds bad but wouldn t it just be better for me to die and get this over with since i ve been thinking about suicide since i was twelve anyway and killing myself would end things forever and i would never have to incur medical expenses for my weaknesses ever again  then no one would have to try to comfort me when i get so sick so fucking often   please just tell me that there is a point to me staying alive just to keep being so awful and useless and sick

t3_dlb90e,raventth5984,it feels like a constant  painful battle ,i feel like it is a constant battle with my mind to struggle against horribly destructive habits   they are too ingrained in me after years  and it feels like a constant battle  using new tools i have been learning from competent therapists to fight against the bad thought and feeling patterns that would suck me down into a black hole of despair  only to leave me withdrawn and paralyzed with misery and fear   it makes me feel constantly anxious  and it is exhausting and draining   it is discouraging to think that it will always feel like this  i do not always want to be fighting against my unhealthy self that has persisted for years   it terrifies me that the battle will never go away  or become more bearable  or that it will take too long of a time for things to become  easier  for me to exercise more positive self care habits   i am fighting very hard to not beat myself up here on this post   about how many years i feel like i have lost because of feeling stuck with incompetent  selfish therapists  and not realizing at the time just how bad their lazy  methods  were for me at the time   it was only shallow comforting and instant gratification that i received from that  therapy  instead of more long term  useful tools for better  positive health and self healing   this constant struggle brings me close to feelings of wanting to just give up   to just give in and consider suicidal options  that is how exhausting and frightening this process has been for me at times   but i have still been fighting against that  i feel so lost ,0

t3_dl6cfj,theamazingsteve1,am i the only one who only exists in their mistakes ,my entire life i spend living in my past  mistakes i made  people i lost  and the utter loneliness and sadness that all of it has brought me   look at me    years ago i had a good job  an incredible girlfriend who loved me no matter what  a healthy and happy home life where i lived with both of my parents despite their being divorced  i maintained happy relationships with the people around me and i was loving life  my girlfriend and i fit together like peas in a pod  we loved each other more than anything  shit  we thought we were going to get fucking married  we were inseparable  and both friends our age and older adults alike agreed we made an excellent couple and a fantastic team  with maturity beyond our years  it was all good  the talks we used to have  being around each other  going to events together  the sex  i loved and cherished every single moment with her and she with me  we never disagreed  not because we are so similar that we couldn t  but because we would talk about what we were disagreeing on and work it out until we didn t disagree anymore  we never yelled  we never got angry at each other  it was stereotypical perfect love   things began to change  my girlfriend s dad s excessive drinking was having a real impact on her happiness  and thus  mine  i was bad at talking about my feelings  so i didn t have the words to tell her what was wrong  i thought that the thing making her sad was me  and so i tried to save her by breaking up with her  less than a month after crushing her heart  i realized my mistake and begged to get back together and let me try to undo what wrong i had done  she considered it  but ultimately it was too late  and she had already moved on    cut to now  two years later  i ve moved out of my parent s house  ruining my relationship with my father in the process  my ex girlfriend is still with the same guy that she ended up with after i left her  they ve been together longer now than we were  it feels so stupid that i still miss her  considering our relationship was relatively short in the scheme of things  but god damn  i still miss her  and i still haven t forgiven myself for leaving her two years ago  i think about my mistake every day  i ve been depressed ever since our relationship ended  and for over a year i quietly sobbed to myself every night  two separate times  i put a gun to my head and began to squeeze the trigger  for almost a year  i had what you might call ptsd  i couldn t close my eyes without seeing her in my rear view mirror  standing in the street  head in her hands while she fucking sobbed her eyes out after i broke her heart  i looked back at that and i fucking drove away  i fucking drove away  when i could ve gotten back out  hugged her  and just fucking opened my mouth and talked to the person i loved more than anything about what was wrong  i ve never forgiven myself for that   now  i ve replaced the crying with alcohol  i come home and start pouring whiskey most nights  more than most people my age  i m not an alcoholic  by any means  i don t feel the need to do it  or even the compelling urge  i just hate the fact that i come home each night to an empty apartment with no pets  darn lease won t let me have them   no friends  no girlfriend or companion  just darkness and the quiet click of my grandfather clock  and so i sit down  and i turn on a light  and i try to watch tv and find the will to eat  and when i finally find it inside me to get up and walk over to the refrigerator  i walk back with a can of reheated shit and a large glass of whiskey  and i just sit there and drink and eat and try not to think about how easy it would be to kill myself anytime i fucking wanted to  the whiskey helps to numb the overwhelming pain    life story  my point is  my past is all i think about  i was happy  once  and i can t help but think about that every moment of my waking life  i can t stop thinking about my mistakes  i can t stop missing this person that i m still in love with  but i also can t right the wrongs that got me here  i can t try again with this wonderful person  the likes of whom i have never found and might never find again  i haven t had another relationship since  apart from a near meaningless one week fling with someone i knew from high school   i know nobody will probably read this  but i have to know  am i the only one  or are there others out there who can t escape their past ,0

t3_dlefhh,PhrygianNoodles,i was fucked over by the education system and life,all of the good jobs available these days involve technology and math  these are the fields that are growing and promise a stable income  for my entire middle school  highschool  and now college experience  i have had but one decent math teacher    of them have been after i had them  and the rest are notorious for being mediocre teachers only in it for the money  i feel i was robbed of a math education and now only know up to algebra   and statistics  i feel like there are entire swaths of information missing that can never be replaced  critical thinking skills i lack because we would learn only   chapters in an entire year  no child left behind bullshit     i m good at humanities  writing  and analytical thinking  but problem solving is a real struggle for me  it seems like i m damned if i take a degree where my strengths are at because no career attached to them can pay off the debt it costs to attain them  but i m also damned if i go into a tech math field where everyone else has an advantage over me    i know there is the medical field but i have actual homophobia that will render me unconscious or nauseous  also  i m not good with my hands but more of a brainstormer writer    i see these career lists with various managers and engineers topping out in income and there are no humanities represented  it s as if all of my weaknesses are what this world functions on and it s very demoralizing  i constantly am trying to become smarter and better at critical thinking but i know my brains developmental potential is pretty much over and i m just wasting my time    trying to learn computer coding languages was seeming pretty easy because i have a natural gift for languages  but trying to make sense of actual code  like creating an order of operations and understanding how things work together  it is panic attack inducing for me  i cant visualize a detailed system in my mind  i m only good at seeing the big picture and guessing where something might fail  i can t contain the information for how one action plays into another efficiently  it s a huge weakness for me  and all of the psychology tests i have done have said the same    i have a great memory to where i can pass college classes without taking notes or studying  but i rely on memory recall triggers and odd associations i make  i can t see all the information at once or anything like that    i m worried i ll be some worthless nobody making    thousand a year substitute teaching because that s the only viable option i see right now that plays to my strengths and isnt extremely debt inducing  it still is to some extent     i m watching my friends begin trade apprenticeships that will end with them making        k dollars a year  they will be able to raise families and enjoy life  i ll always just be scraping by   i m too physically fucked up to work a job like that  i m only    and nearly all of my joints already show serious damage to the cartilage and i hurt all the time  i dont know why because i never physically overexerted myself  i just have weak  brittle joints and bones    as it is i work a minimum wage job       hours a week and am hit with car trouble  medical bills  college fees  and more all the time  i m not able to save but     or     dollars a paycheck and it feels like its adding up to nothing when i see college tuition costs of   k a year  conservatively  in my future    there isnt even a career i want to do which is another big problem  i ve been depressed my entire life and have thought about killing myself daily since i was   years old  its just part of my routine now  i break down and cry at the end of every day and feel the hopelessness wash over me  it s only been amplified by bad decisions i made in highschool that damaged my brain even further    i just have no passion for anything even though i force myself to have hobbies and exercise  life is really hard for me and none of my friends show any support  they are all sociopaths who hardly believe in emotions and sure as hell wont allow me to show any  i m hated by everyone else in the community  i made a lot of enemies when i was young   and i cant leave my friends because they would be vengeful and ruin my life as they have threatened to do   i just feel really stuck and directionless even though i m working harder than i ever have in my life  my mom and grandma just died and my dad has terminal cancer so things arent good at home either  i dont go to school full time so i dont get the free therapy access and i have no health insurance to pay for any outside of that  i m really struggling to find some path that can give me enough money so i dont have to worry about this all day every day ,0
t3_dkfwd8,widmizical,feeling so trapped,i really just feel like i can t stand myself  i want to be nice to myself  to do good things for myself and enjoy my life  but i just hate myself so much  ever since i was able to self medicate my anxiety with drugs and alcohol the anxiety has gotten much worse  while thankfully it isn t really pushing me into worse addiction  it makes me not even look forward to the distraction of consuming substances  i feel so empty  i m in disbelief that life can feel so colorless  i spend all my time looking forward to partying that just makes me feel embarrassed and depressed  and sometimes actually materially affects my life    i m sick of drugs and alcohol  but i use them to hide from myself  i know that in reality i have no choice to but to face myself but it is so hard when i hate that person so much  i might be getting fired from my job because of stupid drunken decisions  and i don t even feel bad for myself  or want to fix things  i would really rather just die    if the people who actually actively are in my life abandon me i feel like i would have to kill myself  i feel like i have been permanently dulled by substance abuse and i will never have the drive or talent in my passions that i used to  after a night of binge drinking i almost always wish it killed me  but i get sick long before that can happen  which makes me beyond embarrassed and forces people to help me  which is the last thing i want   i love my boyfriend so much but i know he will get sick of dealing with me like they all do  i really don t know what else i m supposed to be getting out of my life  i was broken down so much in my self worth by my family and i don t even care  they re right  i just want to get off this ride  i feel like i don t have anything to offer the world and i get dumber and more pathetic every day  i m not very scared of being dead  but everything else is so daunting  but is it more daunting than living this life i ve already screwed up so badly ,1
t3_dlrbog,pennypolendina,unwanted in life  will be in death ,everyone says i m a good friend  but noone asks me if they want to hang out  no one messages me  everyone assumes i m busy or they just don t want me to be around  even my fiance has said he needs space  even he hangs out with my friends without me    it s be better financially for my parents  my siblings don t need a loser like me in their life    i wouldn t have to worry about pointless bullshit like finding a job or paying off my tuition fees or trying to keep up friendships when it seems like noone else wants to    i m just tired  and i should be used to it  but it still upsets me   i told my fiance that i want to die  what do i get   sorry you feel like that   he knows how it feels and all he comes up with is that    maybe i should just end it  seeing as noone cares anyway ,1

t3_dlrfi0,throwawaymaybeidkyet,feeling generally exhausted  unmotivated,i ve had problems with depression since  th grade and since telling my parent about it i ve gotten treatment for it   times so far  first time didn t go so great  second time went better  in fact it worked so well i stopped going to therapy and stopped taking my meds since i thought i was  cured   obviously  that didn t turn out so well  right after getting into university i tried the free therapy and that didn t work out for me either  at this point  i m really struggling  the classes are hard and it s weighing on me emotionally  my thought process is that if i cant do this stuff in school how am i supposed to get a job  buy a house  have kids  etc  but also  im not sure if i like the idea of working    hours a week and having no freedom to live life  nothing feels worth it and it s hard for me to see the point in putting forth the effort if i m just gonna work all the time and potentially not love my life  i m just tired of being sad about this  amongst other things  and i m not sure if it s worth it to give therapy another try  i always go back to the same cycle of being sad   getting over it   then being sad again  i d love it if i had the option to stop feeling anything and stop doing anything ,0
t3_dkvv5d,[deleted],don t know why i m posting,my life looks objectively good on paper  just completed my thesis in may  etc  but i m an alcoholic and addict  i ve already landed in the hospital many times  had many nights where i thought i wouldn t wake up  but i did  i know i m lucky but i don t see myself ever being happy or even functional  i went into dts in august and bought a pint of vodka on the way home from detoxing in the hospital  i will die soon ,1
t3_dlsfzx,memegod-number-420,just some advice and a nice story for anyone who needs it ,so a little story followed by some advice if anyone wants to listen and this is a happy story and i don t want anyone to feel bad about themselves or get jealous after hearing this  i just felt like i need to say that   anyway the story so i m    and a couple months ago i went to summer camp made friends rode horses every day and every night before bed our cabin played the song fireflies by owl city so a couple days go by and out counselors took as to a old building that they used to go to and we went on to the roof and the views was amazing the sun was setting and it overlooked s river and a lot of nice plain grassland all with the nice tint of orange then later unrelatedly fireworks went off and the song fireflies was playing so i was sitting there looking over the fireworks the sunset and the shiny water just not happy but more of at peace with everything   so now i m almost sure that i have chronic depression but when i m feeling real down more than i am in general i think back to how just perfect that experience was and i remember the view and listen to the song and i get happy for a bit    so the advice i would give is to try and find a place in the world we re you can either go or think back in and remember just how nice it was  you can go alone or with someone play your favorite song and stay for as long as you want and go alone or with someone just try to find somewhere you can go that makes you happy and go where your feeling real low and also when your feeling low think back to any positive memory s you have and try to re live them   hope this helped someone out there ,0

t3_dlr5zc,justdontfeelanything,feeling so fucking hopeless right now with depression and being cheated on i fail to see a comfortable future for myself at all,what i mean by comfortable is having a stable job and earning enough for food  a place to live  transportation  and internet  i don t think i will be able to hold down a job after college considering i can t even make it to most of my classes  i have no idea what i am going to do after college and i haven t cultivated a network or done anything noteworthy since enrolling three years ago  i m a business major  that should tell you enough   so that s that  but i found out recently that my boyfriend has been messaging guys on gay hookup apps for a half a year  as well as secretly indulging in a sissy fetish to the point where he joined several discord servers for it and read sissy and feminization guides  i just feel like a sack of garbage knowing my boyfriend wanted to go out and suck cock dressed as a lady  sending pictures of his bare ass to random men  and all the while assuring me he would never cheat on me and that he wasn t gay  he still claims he s not gay and he finds me attractive  btw  i found out all this the day after our anniversary  you wanna know what it s like to feel worthless  just catch your boyfriend messaging transwomen and gay men telling them he would like to be pounded and suck their cocks like a worthless slut whore  his words  not mine  cheating and horrible disgusting misogyny rolled into one  and i thought this man was the one who would stick by me no matter what  he is the person i am closest to and i ve told him everything about my childhood and mental health issues  now it is all gone   on top of all this  i have major depression which i suspect may be misdiagnosed ocd  and childhood emotional abuse trauma in bucketloads  i feel like every single time i have managed to climb the hill of depression  something has dragged me down before i can stabilize myself    for example  my dear dog was killed by my mother s dog this year  and we had to put both of them down  he was my best friend for    years  i even had a lucid dream where i pet him just like old times  but i knew it was a dream because i knew he was supposed to be dead   also  the friends i have currently are either pieces of shit  or the good ones live too far away to see  i have tried all semester to make friendships with new people but it s so hard  i am not an outgoing social butterfly  in fact  the extreme opposite  but i ve put myself out there despite it being so tiring and hopeless   i just wish i could have had a say in whether i was born or not  if i had had the choice to review my full life before being born  i would have said no  i am only passively suicidal   if i got hit by a car and killed  i wouldn t really mind  but i am too weak to carry it out myself   god i hate living,1
t3_dlspey,Hal9000RIP,why do i feel so fuckin ashamed ,i want to die but i don t want to want to die  i felt so worthless and lost for so long but every time someone reaches out and i always broken record   everything is so fantastic  great  formidable  thank you for asking   i need help but i m so ashamed  i feel like there s something so wrong with me like i m broken  i feel like if people really knew just what was inside my head  what i do to myself  i would never live down the  fucked up in the head  label  how can i be so self possessed and hate myself in the same time  this is not the first time i ve gone through this  but this is by far the worst  today was one of the worst in my life  just lying on my floor like usual in the fetal position sobbing like useless piece of shit  for almost   hours  i watched the sun go down from my window and the happy people outside  i didn t watch tv  i didn t want to smoke weed  i just didn t want to  be   so i just laid there  sometimes it just capitulates and i feel like hurting myself  so i just start smashing my head against thing and punching it  today i hit it really hard at one point and saw all these stars and have a nasty headache in the hours since  so i probably concussed myself  finally  i built up the courage to call the one person that might understand and i was going to tell them everything  someone who is kind of like a grandparent to me  i was honestly ready i was going to pour my heart out  i called and she immediately told me she is in hospital for her kidneys and she was trying not to worry me but i m not naive  she said it could potentially be very serious  of course at this point i needed to tell her that everything is goin amazing for me because she definitely needs all the positivity she can possibly get  i m so worried about her now and i want to visit her in the hospital so i can be there for her like she was there for me but she is an ocean apart  i ve moved to a new place and have practically no friends  no loved ones  i just push every one i have left away  i feel so fuckin ashamed about how i feel  i feel like a weak  useless degenerate who contributes nothing to society  i want to be like my dad who is my hero  he accomplished so much for his family and himself  if i had a son  i wouldn t be their hero  they would be ashamed  what a waste  what would they all think of me  parents  etc  they d be concerned but deep down they d feel the same way i feel about it  he s useless  i m useless  will this ever go away  because if it won t  i m not sure how much longer i can take this  i don t know if anyone will read this but if you are reading it then you probably feel something similar  in that case  i wish you the best of luck  even though that means nothing coming from some random fucking    year old on the internet you ve never met ,0
t3_dlrh08,gnataral,dreading my birthday,i m turning    on december   th and am not in school because of mental health problems  i really want to be in school for when it gets all christmassy but i don t think it will happen at this rate  my health is too bad  no one at school has asked if i m okay  not a single person  i suffer from absolute loneliness and complete friendlessness  i have a twin sister who goes to a different school who has a thriving social life and she will come home on our birthday with literal presents from friends   i don t leave my house at the moment due to extreme anxiety and if i stay at home on my birthday and am not in school i will be so depressed and it will be the worst day ever and i will spend the whole day crying  i feel so alone ,0
t3_dlc2pr,GG-92,love is my drug,i m    and i ve had treatment resistant depression for    years now  i also have anxiety  ocd and autism spectrum disorder  i ve tried     medications  various natural remedies  cbt  dbt and tms and i m getting ready to try spravato soon  sometimes my depression will lessen  on two of the meds  but for the most part my life has been a black hole  the one and only thing that seems to bring me out of depression is being in a relationship  that dopamine rush when i feel loved is really the only thing that breaks through in any way shape or form  i don t understand why and it s frustrating to no end because i don t want to rely on anyone for my happiness and it creates unhealthy relationships  hence my current single status for almost a year  does anyone else experience this  how do you cope  it s so hard when the one thing that feels like a cure is mostly out of your control   i also wonder if this is any indication of what is actually wrong with my brain and what might actually finally help ,0
t3_dlq9fg,dubjanka,just another sad soul seeking serenity ,i dont know how to start this  so i ll just try to do my best   growing up i always felt alone  but i just recently realized how alone i was   i was always my mothers least favorite and i knew this  the most evident case was when my little brother broke our baby grand piano and my mom beat the shit out of me for it  then my little brother  feeling bad  admitted that it was him  and my mother bought him a brand new gameboy  for being honest   and he never got hit over that incident   it was a cycle of stuff like this  in the summer i wasnt allowed out until i finished  mommy school    mommy school  was upwards of   hours of summer classes issued by my mother and we had to finish whatever work she decided was necessary for us before we could go outside  when my brother got a question wrong my mom would comfort him and try to teach him how to do the thing better  i distinctly remember spelling a word wrong and getting hit with a flying dictionary before i could even apologize for being such a fucking moron    the cycle of violence continued thru my adolescence and stopped when i hit puberty around    years old  this cycle effected my entire life  i couldnt socialize because of her  example    i pushed one of my neighbors down the driveway on her razor scooter because she asked me to so she could go  as fast as me   and she fell  well my mom used to sit in our garage with the door open chain smoking cigarettes just watching me play  as soon as she saw the girl hit the floor i heard an all too familiar screech  dubjankaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa get your ass over here now   that was the worst beating i can ever remember  she was screaming in my face  her entire face was red as a cherry  spit was flying   at the time i couldnt have been older than     because i remember being about mid thigh height  and she kept screaming do you like being pushed while she threw me into the wall over and over and over while hitting me with a wooden pasta spoon anywhere she could  i was smart enough to know to protect my face but there was nothing i could do to stop my entire body from being thrown around  when she finally calmed down i limped down the street and brought  the girl  back to my mom to explain what had happened  i thought that things were getting better until the girl left and my mom locked the garage door before coming in the house  i knew shit was going to go down  she didnt appologize  she screamed in my face how dare you embarrass me like that    ding ding round two    once that subsided i was allowed to go to my room where i proceeded to cry my fucking eyes out  until i heard a knock on my door and   ding ding round three   i had the distinct pleasure of hearing for the first time in my life  you wanna cry  ill give you a fucking reason to cry   so that round stopped after a few minutes because thank god my father came home    my mother made me feel so estranged from my father that i felt bad asking him for a ride to a friends house  or even just to talk  she always said  dont you dare bother your father hes very busy  it was just her way of keeping me from telling on her for hitting me    i have an older brother  and he was my hero   oh ill explain why in a few paragraphs  because he was the only human in the entire world to interfere with a beating  he was sleeping  and he heard the commotion downstairs  i dont think ive ever heard anyone come down the stairs that quickly in my entire fucking life  and right as i looked down to avoid getting hit in the face the hit never came  i looked up and there he was  in all his glory  my big bro bro  the absolute gem grabbed the pasta spoon mid swing and he screamed at her something along the lines of you might have done that shit to me but ill be damned if you ever do it to him  and we hopped in his jeep wrangler  doorless  and he sped away with me in a baby seat  unfortunately on the way to his friends house we made a sharp left turn and i dont think my brother buckled me in properly  or the seatbelts were faulty like he said  and my entire baby seat came out of the car and i hit the ground and rolled  it wasnt so bad it was only like    mph give or take  and from my toes to my knees the skin was just gone  i had some minor scratches on my arms and face but the majority of the damage was to the legs  so my brother rushed me home and my mom just put me in the bath tub and scrubbed the gravel out  and they put me to bed  and within   minutes my brother came home with the most toys that i have ever seen in my entire life  i got my very own ninja turtles and a buzz lightyear and some batman figurines  i was surprisingly happy about the whole incident   fast forward to my late teens i would always talk about the aforementioned story any time i ever saw my big brother because it was one of the happiest moments of my life  even if i got a beating that day  and fell out of a car  i was just happy that someone cared about me  but my brother had to go ahead and ruin that by saying  are you that fucking stupid that you think i would actually buy you toys  and that i would buy them that fast  those are just the toys mom had around the house to shut you the fuck up when you wouldnt stop crying   well ok then buddy memory ruined   i was never allowed to have a childhood  my entire childhood i was forced to swim for multiple teams      teams per season   yes thats per season and no im not lying    because of this i never got to make any friends because anyone i met during school i could never see after  so during this period of swimming at around age    a coach tried to rape me and i beat his ass in the locker room  it was mid winter and i ran out of the facility into the street and straight into oncoming traffic  thank god a soccer mom in her soccer mom mini van saw me  i had cuts on my chest  was visibly crying  and was soaking wet in a speedo  she took me into her car  asked what happened  covered me in a coat and immediately called the police  within   minutes and im not joking it was the best response time ive ever seen  rambo pulls up  this cop couldnt have been a more muscular guy if he was doing steroids every day since birth  absolutely brollick  he runs up to the car  takes one look at me and says  who did it  and i tell him its jim  jim did it  he runs inside and in   or so minutes he came back out with a new breifcase  and by breifcase i mean my swim coach  he cuffed his hands behind his back  cuffed his ankles and cuffed the ankles and hands together with   sets of cuffs  he walked out with jim crying like the little bitch he was that his circulation was being cut off and bla bla bla  he opens the police cruiser door and throws that little bitch against the door  within a few minutes my mom comes to the scene and sees whats going on and tells the officer to immediately let jim out of the car  my mom insisted that it had to be my fault and that jim would never do this if it wasnt my fault  to this day she tells me that she saw a car with a broken window and she thought i smashed jims window and jim beat me up because of that  nobody i know ever saw a broken window  not even the cop when i came back a year later to decide if i wanted to press charges  i didnt want to press charges  i had just hit puberty  so i wanted to get a sanctioned boxing match against jim so i could kill him and get away with it  the officer informed me that regrettably i could not do that  so i didnt press charges   my mother always used to tell me that if i was ever drinking and needed help to call her  so when i was about    i got drunk and called my mom to pick me up  right before she got there the police arrived as well  she walked thru them and came to get me and started screaming arrest this motherfucker and all this shit infront of my entire class  it was so embarassing  that was the night i told her i wanted to kill myself  she told me to go to bed and called a shrink that was retiring in   weeks  the shrink gave me every single sample he had of anti depressants  coupled with literally no therapy  we just used to play with his guns and then he would let me leave  so i just got     s of free anti depressants but thats not a good thing  i have rapid cycling manic depression  they make me go hyper manic    so eventually things die down but im still alone  because of how i acted as a person  i had no self awareness and no introspection at all  and because of how my mother was i was entirely unable to make a real friend  everyone that i was friends with invited me out so they could laugh behind my back and use me for my money  i started landscaping at    because i needed money  i was always known as the lazy child though  anywho  you know how they say if youre not in a group chat thats because the group chat is talking about you  well i ve never been in a group chat my entire life  ive also never been invited to a party  ive also never had a best friend  ive had a series of girlfriends that were just more and more like my mother  until i met my most recent girlfriend  we ll call her d  hi d sorry youre on the couch and im being weird on reddit  so up until d i never had a friend  being with this woman has shown me what an actual friend is like  what being comfortable is like  and its nice  well thats alie  my dads always been my best friend  he s really the only person who ever wanted to hang out with me  he would take me kayaking and golfing and to baseball games  its really dope  im    and we still chill on the regular  without him i would have undoubtedly killed myself     amp  x   b    amp  x   b   i feel like im rambling  im sorry guys  i dont really know how to properly express my deep sadness     amp  x   b   what i was trying to get at is that just because someones cis gendered  and white  and middle class  and decent looking doesnt mean their problems are invalid  my entire life my ability to feel sad has been socially invalidated because of those   qualities i have  thats unfair and i don t appreciate it  everyones problems are relative  everyone has a best and a worst moment and no one gets the right to tell you dont   eg  if your entire life is perfect and nothing bad ever happens to you until one day you step on a lego and it really really hurts  and you keep telling everyone how much it hurts and how its effecting you and no one listens  well i hear you  and i really am sorry that you had to go through that  you just experienced your worst moment and you re still here  what can i do to help you  do you wanna go for a walk  do you want to talk about it  wanna just watch tv and forget about it  count me in  the only problem is you cant count me in  because you dont talk to me and youve always made fun of me  but hey  despite everything  id still be here to talk to you if you wanted  you just choose not to talk to me    amp  x   b   tldr  i m an emotional mess who cant express himself and i m just now at    learning how to deal with life  it s never too late  if you refuse to accept failure as an option you will eventually succeed  i m    and   years ago i was homeless because my mom kicked me out because and i quote  if youre a fag i will never love you   well im not a whole fag  just half of one  bi  but in those   years since losing everything  i have found myself  and i never thought i would  i still dont have a job  but im in school  i only have two friends  but thats way more than i had before  ones my dad and the others my girlfriend     amp  x   b   idk im just sad and wana vent  i wish i could do it better  but eventually i ll get some closure or i ll just pop like a balloon filled with too much vapid bullshit    amp  x   b   if anyone wants to talk  i m down  maybe we could start a reddit group chat so we can all help  eachother and just have some good vibes and good times    amp  x   b   i love u reddit  you re like the best friend i always dreamed of  if reddit could give actual hugs it would be a perfect place  but i guess pobodys nerfect ,0

t3_dljg9u,throwaway_41708,i feel like a hopeless failure ,i don t even have an excuse for leading such a sucky life   my parents are brilliant  caring  and very successful people   not rich  exactly  but affluent enough that i ve never wanted for anything   there was certainly enough money for me to have a great college experience and make something of myself afterwards   i just didn t   part of it was laziness  part of it was uncertainty about what i wanted to do with my life and dissatisfaction with all of the obvious choices   my parents even had me tested  and not only do i not have any learning disabilities  i have significantly above average iq   but now  i m just another adult with escapism issues   i ve been feeling so depressed and anxious lately that it s making me feel physically ill   my parents were married at my age and i ve never even had an so   things aren t going well at work  i think i m on the brink of losing my job   i want to carry on but i honestly don t know how i can ,1
t3_dlcdf8,Who_U_Calln_Pinhead,i m suicidal and i have nobody,i m    and i m getting professional help for my depression  that s the only good thing i have going for me at the moment  i have no friends or supportive family with me  all my mom does is make jokes about finding me dead in the closet   i m not exaggerating  she legitimately makes suicide jokes about me quite regularly   my father is also mentally ill and a narcissist  despite me telling him that i go to therapy and have recurring nightmares about his abuse  he doesn t care  he just tells me to take some xanax  my sister      lives outside of the country but is the only support i have    today we got into an argument  she  said  i can listen to you all day  but when i get upset about something its a problem   to add further context  she got upset about something that is completely out of our control  i really couldn t help her and i told her that it s out of our hands  i also made an inappropriate joke that she took offense to  but i apologized for all of that  she called me an asshole and accused me of invalidating her   i always make an effort to be there for her and ask her how she s doing  even on the days where i can hardly get out of bed  but i understand that i may not be there enough  i really make an effort to not mention my problems too often  because i don t want to be a burden  so i asked her if i really talk about my problems that much  my sister backtracked and said no  but i feel like she was just lying to spare my feelings     she said a lot of hurtful things in the argument  but that line really fucked me up  like i can t stop thinking about it  she is literally the only support i have and i really try not to bother or upset her  i even asked her a few weeks ago and she said it was fine  all of a sudden i m this burden to her  i honestly don t see the point in sticking around if i m a nuisance to the only person who cares  i get how difficult it is to deal with a person who is depressed  i just really feel like shit  i m trying in therapy  i m trying to not be a nuisance  but i feel like i m failing at everything     tldr  i m just a fuck up   edit  my mother is lovely and i don t think she really wants me to kill myself  she just doesn t understand mental illness and takes it as a joke  even so  her suicide jokes still make me uncomfortable ,0

t3_dldwqj,carmensandiego6,i want to die,sorry  just need to vent here  i ve been seriously considering ending my life on a daily basis for months now and to be honest i don t know why i haven t yet  i hate my job  i m in the military  so i can t just quit   i am having immense financial problems primarily due to the fact that i had some legal trouble earlier in the year that everyone seems to label me for  i ve been living where i m at for a year now and haven t been able to cultivate any lasting or meaningful friendships  i had a s o  but they moved for work and the distance was putting a strain on our relationship  amongst other things  like my depression  so we both decided it would be best to go our separate ways  i have lost a lot of friends due to unnecessary drama at work and my reputation at work has been affected because of this  i am just so sad and angry all the time  i can t remember the last time i was truly happy and everything just seems to be getting worse and everything is just building up and i can t take it anymore  i don t want to live life like this  i just want it to all end  i don t see how things can possibly get better  everything has just sort of spiraled out of control and it seems impossible to fix  the only reason i am still here i think is because i have two very loving and caring parents who i know would be crushed  i think the plan i have set in place right now is to give it until the end of the year and if i m still feeling this way i m probably going to call it quits  i m sorry for ranting on an app  i just don t know what else to do at this point ,0

t3_dlm47m,FauxStardust,the feeling is back,i feel so dead inside again  i haven t been this depressed since my last attempt  i ve been staying at home for weeks and if i go out i get blackout drunk and make some seriously fucked up choices   i don t really know what to do  i can t just do this again  i can t continue laying around wishing for someone to just be my friend so i don t have to live inside of my head where my thoughts nonstop eat away at me   every morning when i wake up i wish everything weren t real and dread the fact that i ll have to just exist for a whole day  the only people who talk to me at the moment are my parents  both of which are narcissistic and just being near them is a constant psychological battle   and because they re the only people who speak to me i try to share things i like and enjoy talking about but they just get annoyed or completely ignore me  and then i remember why nobody wants to talk to me  i m just a nuisance  a waste of space  a disaster  whatever you want to call it  but what i know for sure is that everyone around me wants me to vanish   just within a month my entire friend group turned on me  then my boyfriend did too and started hitting me   it made me realise how little people give a fuck about me let alone my wellbeing   i let the violence continue until i just called the cops one day  now it s been some time after and this is the most isolated i ve ever been   i keep thinking i can text a friend about what s going on and then i remember none of them want to speak anymore  i keep waking up and expecting my boyfriend to be in the house and he isn t here either  and then i remember why too   i keep picking my phone up every time it buzzes praying it s a text from someone  and it never is   i feel like i m watching the entire world happen from a telescope  seeing my used to be friends posting photos of all the parties and events and adventures they re going on  i m really glad they re happy but i miss being a part of that  how the fuck did i go from making friends every time i leave the house to having none and being kept inside due to crippling anxiety  how and why  i m so tired of life   this was pointless to post but i need to get this out and put it somewhere  i m losing my mind ,0

t3_dlmyt3,cw1ley,nobody believes me that i have depression,everybody s like  open up to someone  it will really help  well that can t happen because my parents think i m just lazy and that all of this is my fault  i m tired of convincing them that i need help  i m done trying  i just wish i could die but i m too scared to make that acctually happen  life just fucking sucks ,0
t3_dkc9xx,yoru_no,living just isn t feasible  that s all,i had the crushing realization that my life has gone from running well to skidding to a slow grind of not being able to dream anymore  i don t choose things based off how fulfilling  meaningful  or happy they make me  but rather what would be least painful to do that i can keep up with  it s made me realize that despite all this pain i do possess some very twisted and faded sense of responsibility because my priority is really to bother people as less as possible  it offers a glimpse behind the shattered glass to who i was and maybe who i could have been if i could have redirected that energy productively instead of just to scrape at the bottom of the narrow barrel of choices i have   i can t see the light at the end of the tunnel  i ve gone years realizing that i can t live like this  but being unable to go because of all the loose ends that i d still have to tie  see  twisted sense of responsibility again   i have gone into such severe mental hazes where physical pain is dulled  and i am slowly starving myself   i am in the process of slowly  deliberately  cutting out someone who wants to help me because i don t think i m worth the support it d take to keep me alive  i m going to slowly tie up all these loose ends   i know i m not dead yet  but i know that i m basically slowly killing myself already  one day  i ll make it  one day i ll ride off somewhere i won t return from  it s nice being able to post this  it s one little respite from keeping up appearances and cracking under every little lie in real life  it s nice knowing that this is just another post of a faceless person that ll get buried and lost  but at least being able to type it out and affirm this for myself ,1

t3_dl6dxk,Sellion123,my family never  ever take action,      i m mad right now so obviously i ll regret writing this later  but who cares        when i went to the doctors a couple months back for my physical  i decided i would actually put some truth into the little forms they give you instead of just acting like i live in lala land to not scare my mom  i put how i really felt  albeit dumbed down  as in i feel sad some days  instead of most or something like that  and when my mom and i got in the car she told me the doctor reccomended therapy         now  this is either my worst nightmare or my dream  i could never tell my mom that i even think i have depression because i just couldn t handle it  so when it turns out my doctor did the heavy lifting for me  i was pretty relieved  i said sure  why not  however many months later  not a peep about it  not one word said about it after the car ride  my brother  after learning i might be getting therapy  decides to ask my mom about going to rehab  because he is high key addicted to smoking weed  and my mom says sure  again  not a fucking word after that conversation  today  my dog eats a fucking pen  and you now what my mom does    nothing  i know now that he wasn t in danger  but still  my dog has a fucking problem with eating inanimate objects  and i think you can guess whats going to be done about that         don t get me wrong  my mom is not the problem  its my whole family dynamic  we are the most non confrontational   don t ask  don t tell  motherfuckers on this planet  yknow what happens when you dont confront problems  they get worse        this was just a rant  and i don t know why i wrote it  but it took a long time so i m going to post it anyway,0

t3_dl48a4,BodyOfLandru,i tried to hang myself last night,not a throwaway cause fuck it  i have nothing to lose now but my life itself   found out the ex i haven t gotten over got married over the weekend  i m sure to most this is a  whatever  situation  to me  it was devastating   i ve been depressed and had suicidal thoughts for many years  in fact  my depression and anxiety got in the way of our relationship  just one of many reasons she rightfully dumped me   i m not mad at her  i m glad she s happy and found someone to spend her life with  i wish it was me but i know i wasn t good enough and that really hurts me   so last night i got out an old belt to make a makeshift noose  needless to say  as i m typing this now  it didn t work  it s not as easy as movies make it seem  i m a big guy and even with a large belt it didn t have much length after being knotted around the doorknob and placed over my head  i assumed a crouching position  as it was the only one that seemed to work  and i could feel myself quickly losing blood to my head   i stopped for two reasons     i don t live alone and i was scared that the unorthodox position would make a lot of noise  i didn t want attention drawn to my attempt     despite this  i was scared  until you ve had the noose over your neck you don t know the fear of death  and this is coming from someone who wants his suffering to end   i am sure i ll attempt this again with a different ligature and maybe in an isolated location  this is not the result of a hasty  impulsive decision  i ve carefully considered my future and what s in store for me  there is nothing i look forward to  everything that interests me is in the past  i have no prospects for a future and no passion or drive or ambition to find something  i ve run out of options  this latest news of the one that got away getting away was the cherry on top   thanks for reading ,1

t3_dlgbq1,ItsMe98_ItsYou,i raped my ex girlfriend  i can t take the remorse and disgust anymore but i don t want to hurt my parents by killing myself,i ve posted this story before  but in the meantime i ve come to realize more things  i finally believe my realizations and recollections are definitive   i have autism  asd  which for me mainly focusses around overthinking and obsessing  in obsessive periods i convince myself that i am something that i don t want to be  and drop everything i m doing at that moment to force myself to think about things that prove whether i am a good or a bad person  i can t stop until i find  that missing piece  in my memory that makes the difference and can put my mind at ease  i have therapy for this  the past two months  this takes hours each day since i ve been realizing i made a mistake in the past with regards to sex  i ve come to realize that i acted horribly wrong   my ex has borderline personality disorder  we were both    at the time  this happened   years ago  we were in a relationship for   months  my ex had sexual traumatic experiences due to past relationships  causing her to dissociate sometimes  this rarely happened during sex but the one time it happened before she would become motionless  experience flashbacks and would not be able to say stop  our relationship was very bad  she was manipulative  blamed me for everything and we had fights all the time  she was afraid i would leave her cheat on her if i didn t get enough sex from her and sometimes was angry at me because  i would definitely cheat on her in the future   despite all this we also had our good moments and i  at the moment thought  at least  that i  loved her   let me explain the night of my mistake  where i try to explain my thought process at the time   one night i hint that i m into sex  she immediately asks me if i sometimes think about sex with other people  i m a bad liar and i don t want to lie to anyone in the first place  so i m honest and admit that i sometimes  think  about sex with others  as a sudden thought or during masturbation   but not with any intentions to act on it  i only want to have sex with my girlfriend  this turns into a fight where i try to reassure her of this   when the fight calmed down  she asked me if i wanted sex  she still looked very bummed out and sad about the fight  so i figure she was not sincere and told her that i only want sex if she also wants to have sex and that i don t want her to initiate sex when she does not want to  i think she initiated because before the fight i told her i was in the mood  and suspected somewhere that the fight might have played a part in her decision  she tells me she wants too  i ask her a few more times if she was sure  because it didn t look like she was  although unenthusiastically reluctantly  she kept saying that she was sure  i wanted too  so i initiate foreplay but she told me that she did not want that  and told me to start right away with the deed itself  i remember that i had to slightly push her legs aside myself but i did not think much of that  since she initiated and told me she was sure  i ask her one more time if she is sure and she said something along the lines of  just start already    i was still not convinced that she really wanted this  but my asshole brain thought it was not legally wrong to have sex with someone who initiates herself and tells you that she is sure  also  it s her own choice and responsibility if she gives consent  i m not proud of this mindset  but i also had a thought of   if you don t want this  you should have been honest or you have to tell me you don t want this when we start in a minute   so we start  the sex was really bad  she was passive  unenthusiastic and barely moving at all  because of this i thought about her maybe dissociating  but somehow i got some cues that made me think that she was not  i figured  during the sex  that instead she was just angry or sad about the fight and that she set that aside and wanted me to have sex with her to please me  since she initiated after the fight and said yes every time i asked if she was sure   the reason i thought that she was angry sad because of the fight instead of dissociating was that she was passive and unenthusiastic from the very start  where she told me verbally that she was sure that she wanted sex  so she made the decision to have sex while she already knew herself that she didn t feel good  i told her that if there s something wrong she has to say so   it gets worse  i have a memory of myself thinking feeling during the sex about what i m doing is wrong  maybe i even thought about rape  but proceeding anyway  driven by something i don t know  emotion  selfishness libido  blind obedience to her words  i really don t know what the exact thought was  but i know it gave me a malicious vibe  it felt like   what i m doing right now is wrong rape but i ll continue anyway  or  so this is how rape feels like  might as well proceed because it s too late anyway   maybe i just shrugged it off as another intrusive thought  maybe i could not take it seriously because i was just here  in my girlfriend s bedroom  having sex  something we ve been doing a hundred times before  maybe i was stubborn and decided to shut my brain down  with the thought about just following the unenthusiastic verbal consent my girlfriend gave me  i just didn t care anymore for some reason   now from here it s when it s becoming a mess in my brain when thinking back about it  i have  memories  about different scenarios that happened and thoughts that i could have had at the time  and i don t know which ones are real and what my exact thoughts were  i have a scenario in my head where i did suspect she was dissociating but went on anyway  and a scenario where i disregarded the possibility of her dissociating and just thought she was just letting me have sex with her  the latter is something i ve always convinced myself  but the past few days the first option has been popping up in my mind   what i do know is that i did indeed proceed  as far as i know that malicious thought described before went away pretty quick  i already figured there was something wrong  but i think i followed my reassuring thoughts i described before  i remember trying to undress her  she was just wearing her night gown  but stopping since she did not help  again  did i think  she does not want this so i ll stop   or did i suspect her dissociating  i ve always thought it was the first thought  also  she did not return my kiss so i stop kissing her with the thought  she is probably still mad at me  and do not kiss her again  when i asked her something later  still during the sex  she verbally responded  me even asking something in the first place would indicate that i already had in mind that she did not dissociate  right  plus  she responded so at that point she was definitely not dissociating  i finish and when i gesture to finish her as well she tells me no  so we go to sleep   the next day she told me that she did not feel comfortable about what i did last night  she then told me about her past trauma again  at the time i felt angry since i felt that she lied to me when she consented  later that day she forgave me and i didn t think much of it after that  we broke up the day after that  since all the fights  blaming  manipulation that happened in the relationship got way to much for me  and now also the incident of   days before happened   after the break up she couldn t stop texting  calling and stalking me saying she wanted me back almost       the next moment she sent me e mails cursing at me and calling me names  saying that she probably only had a relationship because she felt lonely and that kind of stuff  this was not a fun period  she even asks me to have sex with her just one more time and i declined and blocked her   this and how to proceed after the break up had been carefully decided along with my therapist  along with making sure she would not harm herself    now    years later  looking back at it after all the  metoo debate and discussion about enthusiastic consent  i feel very guilty about that sexual experience  about two months ago it hit me  she might have been wrong by not being honest  but i was definitely wrong as well  i should have taken her passive behaviour during the sex as a sign to stop  i should have taken her irrational fear of me otherwise leaving her in consideration and make the moral choice based on that  i regret this all so much  i ve never wanted to hurt her  how could i have went on with the thought  she gave verbal consent  so it s not wrong to have sex  instead of taking her body language in account  i saw things were wrong but i thought she set that aside to make the choice to initiate sex  how could i be so     ing selfish  because that s how i feel about it now  that i was an asshole  when in doubt or when verbal consent and body language contradict  just stop just in case  it s the moral thing to do  i take full responsibility for my actions that night  since i realized this all two months ago  this keeps me up at night  it s the only thing i can think about now  i definitely learned from this  but i still can t forgive myself   what bothers me the most is that one malicious  rapey  thought  i ve never been inappropriate with girls  always made sure i had consent  never had  rape fantasies  and always rejected sex lost my libido when i suspected my girlfriend was initiating while actually not wanting to  my girlfriend even told me multiple times i was acting too soft during sex and actually wanted me to be more forceful sometimes  but i did not like that idea  why did i have that malicious thought and not care  was i just tired of her bpd behaviour  was i angry because i saw that she was not being honest  i guess i will never know  what i do know is that i would never do this again   how can i go on with my life knowing i had a sudden malicious thought during an already questionable act  i knew it was wrong and i didn t care  do i even deserve forgiveness from society  i just can t live with the knowledge of having done this  the fact remains that i have taken advantage of someone sexually   the only thing i can think of right now is killing myself  i can t concentrate on anything else or pretend like nothing happened  the thing is  i can t kill myself  my parents and sister are in a very bad situation because of their own mental health  this would ruin the lives  there are a few options     i kill myself  hurting my family   i confess this to them  hurting my family   i go to the police but won t get a case because legally this wouldn t be rape  we have a  no means no  policy here  not  yes means yes  yet    i apologize to my ex gf  hurting her by coming back into her life again mentioning something sensitive   i live on and suffer with this in secrecy  hurting my family because i can t function anymore  i can t win  and i deserve the suffering  i am in therapy but the idea that i ve done something horrible like this can never go away  i just wish i would get killed or get an accident so i wouldn t have to make the decision myself ,1

t3_dln83i,The_Heef,i ve stopped taking meds or going to my depression support group ,i ve been unemployed for the last two months and every day i look and apply for jobs  which just makes me more depressed  i got dumped again a few weeks ago because i had another depression episode and she couldn t handle it  and i really don t blame her   so i really have no reason to leave my bed besides peeing  grabbing a beer  and occasionally go for a walk by myself       i took a break from my meds because i m unemployed and they ll probably have to last me a while  and going to a support group helped for a little while  but now it just consists of trying to speak over       people who all just give me imposter syndrome because i m just depressed       i m     so at my age  most of my friends are busy with jobs and significant others  while i keep losing mine  i want to care  i want to agree that things will get better  but every few months something big falls apart and i m back down again  so here i am  back in bed ,0
t3_dlfu8h,obliviouslyintuitive,help,don t   and before you brush me off  let me tell you why   it ll be a good day  going about business as usual  feeling like things are finally starting to get back to normal   maybe catching up with some of those neglected friends who became so out of fear they d get too close and see you for what you truly are   and then  drinks are suggested  just one  not even enough to be buzzed  just something to be sociable  you resist valiantly at first  insisting you don t need it and proudly relishing in your conviction   but  whether it be over the next few days  weeks  or even months  your resolve begins to weaken    what s one night   you think    i work hard  i deserve to let loose for once   and oh  you do   it starts with a couple drinks  back to back   you hardly feel a difference   so  you have a few more  and a few more   and  more  after all you ve made it this far  why stop now    it s almost always about here that feeling begins creeping at the edge of your consciousness   a resentful look here  a disapproving comment there  at first you re able to cast them off as a result of overthinking and blurred rationality  but as the night goes on it gets worse  and worse  and worse   suddenly  strangers are hyper analyzing down to the slightest change in your posture  boring deeply rooted holes of self hatred into your psyche with unforgiving eyes   those who know you best  unfortunately offer no relief  every intimate moment shared in confidence comes rushing painfully back as you suspect they ve only ever lent a listening ear so as to pinpoint your insecurities  and validate them    such a fool you were to think anyone could love you with your abundance of detrimental flaws   all you want to do is pull further and further into yourself until you simply cease to exist  at least then those dreadful eyes would have nothing left to sink into   sadly  you can never seem to figure out how   no matter how much you dodge and duck and deny and justify  it s just not enough   everything you say is wrong   everything you do is wrong   so why try  you know it s all an act  and at the end of the day you re still a burden holding back the rest of humanity   and then finally       finally  nothing   the next day you re back to normal  well  pretending to be normal  but it s too late  they know  and they ll never forget  no matter how much you beg for forgiveness for showing such weakness  those god damn eyes are unrelentless  they may brush it off now  but you ll know under the surface  they re only one mistake away from catapulting you back into that lost place   and try as you may to prove the contrary  that dreadful place is inevitable  and you know it ,0

t3_dluefe,Panther_Eyes,my depression is getting better  now  i m scared i ll change ,i ve had severe depression for over half my life  it started when i was young  around ten  and it has swallowed my life for almost two decades   recently  though  things have been looking up  i ve finally got a decent job that i like  my coworkers seem nice  and i m making enough money to actually support myself  my depression has eased off the slightest bit  and i feel like i have the energy and the drive to actually accomplish things again for the first time in almost three years   but the thing is  i ve lived with this black cloud for so long  it had a huge influence on my formative years  and so much of my identity is interwoven with depression  my taste in music  the stories i write  the books i enjoy    in a way  i kind of learned to live with it and at times even enjoy it   there s a song lyric that says   there s magic in this misery   and that kind of fits me to a t  my depression wasn t going away no matter what i tried  so i just accepted that it part of who i was   but now that it s getting better  i m starting to fear that i m not so much  improving  as i am losing a part of myself  don t get me wrong  i don t want to stay a miserable  messed up failure forever  but when that black cloud goes away  how much of me is going to go with it  already i ve stopped myself mid conversation when i say things and then think   wait  that s not me   and i funnelled all my inner despair into my creative side  if the depression goes  will my writing ever be as good again   i m thankful things are improving for me  i really am  but i m also afraid that without the ball and chain of depression holding me back  i ll lose the person i ve worked so hard to become  is this normal  or am i just going crazier than usual ,0
t3_dlcpp8,kokona-rema,does being sad ever end   ,sometimes  why you won t let go of what s making you sad it s because it s the only thing that made you happy  but how do you find something else that makes you happy or is sadness something you can t get rid of  what if sadness just keeps hitting harder everytime  like if it s testing you  hurting you more and more driving a person to want it all to be over  does it really get better or is it just a thought we need to think so we have comfort ,0

t3_dkqy22,TehTexasRanger,how to stop comparing myself to others ,i m    and i ve had major depression and anxiety for most of my life but now it s at an all time high  even with a college degree i hate my life more than ever and feel like a complete failure  everyday i see people who are my age and they re doing way better than me financially which means they are better than me as a person and i can t take it  i see them going to exclusive events  having acting careers  seeing them on media outlets  keep in mind  these aren t celebrities but people i know irl    then i imagine people who have made it when they were my age like mark zuckerberg and basically every athlete ever  i m over hear doing absolutely nothing with my life making   k a year at best     k at worst  i feel like a failure as a human being and like i deserve to be treated as such so i don t mind being treated like crap because i feel like i deserve to be treated this way for being a failure    it s hard for me to do anything anymore without constantly comparing them to myself  it s hard for me to enjoy anything when all i see is a bunch of people doing what i couldn t even dream of doing living their dream while i am stuck on the sidelines  i ve been to therapy and been on a few pills at this point  but it hasn t helped and now i m at the point where i barely have energy to do anything  what should i do   tl dr     year old with major depression can t stop comparing himself to successful people around his age or people who were successful by age  therefore feels like less of a human being and should be treated as such ,0

t3_dlorw3,rocketcat05,i don t want to die  help ,a little back story  i m autistic  i was taken out of high school for issues i had with the environment and how it negatively affected me i didn t say a word to anyone anymore  i skipped frequently  ran away from home hoping someone would kill me or take me away  after i was taken out  it was nice at first because i could just do my schoolwork in peace and play videogames for the rest of day  everyday  all day  eventually  even though i was in an environment that better suited me  i was still depressed and hopeless about my future and still hated myself for being different from everyone else  i had no doubt that i was going to kill myself eventually one day in the near future with how things were  at that point  i d been locked in my room for around   years  and hadn t been outside in around   years  i was nothing less than miserable and ready to call it quits   but  i somehow kept myself distracted on videogames long enough that another   years had passed  i was still miserable  but i was alive  i was    at that point and knew i was hurdling towards adulthood  i knew i had zero skills of any kind  i knew i was socially inept in every regard  and i knew i still had no clue on what i wanted from life  so again  i was planning on killing myself before i turned    with a mindset of   this world isn t made for people like me   and   i d make it nowhere if i couldn t communicate   although  amidst all that frustration and confusion  after a meltdown where i broke some things  i just got an idea from nowhere   i had literally nothing to lose but my sanity  so i pursued it and started writing my idea  and i wrote  and wrote  and wrote  and wrote all the way through      without noticing  around late       i realized that writing actually made me feel good and it was something i was good at  i had found a purpose to live and a goal to chase  that was the thing i was missing my entire life and it was now right in front of me  i d been dead for so long  just cruising by along the river of life  and i d finally gotten a hint of what it felt like to be alive  i didn t want it to fizzle out   fast forward to now  and i ve written my first fantasy novel coming to    k words  i m working on a sequel to the first and a standalone on the side as of this moment  but then it came back to me that i was going to spend my life in this room  i don t want to spend my life in this room  i want to experience things my own way and not be restricted to these four walls for forever  then  i was back to wondering what was the point in writing  just so it could rot in this room alongside me  and not bring others as much joy and excitement as it s brought me in writing it  i want to live so badly  but at the same time  i don t if this is what my life will be   i asked my mother to let me see a doctor so i could get help and maybe get to a point where i can function enough to exist in the outside world  but it doesn t seem like she s on board  at first  she said i d see one in september  then it was pushed back to october  and now october s almost over and i m still sitting in the same spot i ve been in the last five years  i can t do anything on my own because i m powerless and have nothing  again  i m back to thinking i guess i m killing myself after all  and this time it feels like the end  like i m aiming a gun at my own head and waiting to pull the trigger  why should i keep jumping through hoops and trying to better myself  when i always end right back where i started  feeling the same as i ve always felt  i don t want to go without saying i fought my hardest  so after october passes  i m going to have myself put into a psych ward  but i m also afraid that will result in nothing  and then i ll really have to kill myself and it ll be over  i ll be dead and have never known what it meant to be alive   that s why i m also here  i don t want to die  but i m weak and tired after fighting the same cause the entirety of my life  what other options do i have besides dying ,0

t3_dle06d,hacarroll84,can someone just tell me it will be okay ,it had been a long month and a half  before this  things were going well  i had a really good job for the first time ever  and then for seemingly no reason  i felt like i would rather be dead than go to work  i was sent to the hospital  i was put on leave  and i have spent the last   weeks doing a lot of self destructive things instead of trying to get better    after being released from the hospital  i skipped all my follow up treatments  i lied to my boss and said i was still going so i could have more time off work  i racked up maybe        in credit card debt buying stupid stuff i see advertised to me on facebook because it gives me    seconds of joy  i ve disappointed my mom  i ve pushed away my boyfriend    today  i had to officially resign from my job because i was supposed to return with a note from my therapist saying i had successfully completed programming and was mentally sound enough to return to work  since i skipped everything  i had no way to produce a note  so i resigned    now i am unemployed  broke  with a lot of bills that need paid  i have no idea how i m going to pay them  i have no idea how i m going to survive  i should have just done the things  but it s too late for that now  and now i m paying the price i suppose   ps my regular therapist is dropping me for not completing the higher levels of care i was referred to after leaving the hospital and i had to quit my meds because my doctor wouldn t authorize a refill for the same reason so now on top of all of this  i am going through withdrawal and have stupid bad nausea and brain zaps ,0

t3_dkc0c4,evan_roy,survived    for how long ,tried attempting suicide     needless to say it wasn t successful  nothing is stoping me to try plotting again    people are in the mindset of i am just going to get better from here  but no    i will keep using the same fake smile  i will keep using the same fake laughter  to get through things     and try to find ways to end it in another time  how long can this last i wonder     seems to ne like a never ending cycle  but now i have experience in trying  hope i won t fail twice    unlike other things i do at least ,1

t3_dl5mht,flooded_lungs_toto,my future is hopeless,i have no reason to go on  i see all these people around me getting into relationships and i realize i m gonna be alone forever  nobody wants to be with a fat depressed loser  none of my meds are helping  my grades are slipping  and all i do is disappoint my parents  it feels like they re losing hope with me  i just feel like there s no reason to live anymore ,1
t3_dkq9gh,throwaway87087087087,i don t know,it s just been my   th birthday  i ve suffered with depression  ptsd  anxiety and self harm issues since i was     i was abused physically mentally and sexually by my father  growing up i ve done a lot of things i m not proud of including becoming massively dependent on cocaine and weed  i got myself into several abusive relationships both mentally and physically  most notably a relationship i was in when i met my dad for the first time since i was     i was    at the time of meeting him and i had an anxiety attack the day it happened so my ex beat the fuck out of me including hitting me numerous times with a lump hammer    i m not a well person  i m incredibly ill  i don t know why i m writing these words all i know is i think i m ready to die  my life is better now i m in a loving relationship  a nice rented home earning a steady wage  i have nice things in my life and honestly i couldn t ask for much more other than perhaps more money so i could be a little more financially stable or own my own home    yet i m massively suicidal    every single day i think about taking my life  i ve recently been googling if a toaster in a bath tub will actually kill me because i don t want to build up the courage to do it for it to not work    i think my main question and the reason i m writing this is  is it okay for me to be ready to die  i mean if you actually look at all the things i ve been through i don t think anybody can blame me for wanting it    i m very lost,1
t3_dl6yc8,kingggabby,how do you make yourself happy ,i can t be this depressed anymore  i have so much work to do  and all i want to do is sit at home and get high  i was walking around my house yesterday and i was thinking about how i really don t know how to be happy anymore  it s been a dark few months and i m getting doctors help  but i need solutions now   how do you even make yourself be happy  anything beyond the typical exercise  eat well  sleep lots  etc would help  i need to try and get the spark back in my life so i can make it through til christmas ,0
t3_dlijrj,uglyman96,im ugly  really ugly ,most of my life i was rejected by almost everyone except my parents but they too joke about my appearance  which made me almost suicidal   imagine even your parents hate your looks   people also say it right into my face that i m ugly  never had a girlfriend and never had sex   i had to admit that i won t be getting this things in life and just accept everyone hated me without me even being able to do anything about it   no surprise  i got bullied in school and i couldn t make it far  now i m    years old  have a bullshit job i work for and still live with my parents   and then i hear people saying  beauty comes from inside  or  noone is really ugly   this simply isn t true and they probably won t ever understand unless they are in that situation themselves   i probably would have killed myself already if i haven t listened to alan watts and eckhart tolle they helped me alot to control my thoughts and emotions and i don t really take anyone s opinion that seriously anymore but it s still hard to live through this experience   i would describe myself as a rotten tomatoe only useful to feed the animals or something worse ,0
t3_dl9d5r,cheese123456789,does anyone know how to fight back against the fatigue ,as the title suggests i am tired and worn down  i m ground into the floor and i can t use rage or substances to fight back anymore  for context i am on the spectrum  i struggle every day with sounds and environments  communication styles and social expectations  i want to just exist in the world and be as others are  but with less effort needed to do so  i feel like trying to fight against everything and contain my emotions to be able to enjoy the social interactions that i yearn for isn t a sustainable path for me  any advice  anyone feel the same ,0
t3_dl8ahu,ChipsAndQueso17,i feel like i m suffocating  i wish we could pause time just for a few moments ,i feel like time is running circles around me  taking every last breath right out of my lungs  i can t stand to look at myself in the mirror because i hate myself  but it s even harder to look at my son knowing i don t even have the energy to play with him  i ve been swallowed by this relentless and merciful depressive episode and i have no idea what to do  i refuse to take medications for my illness because of my past drug abuse  i m sad  but yet i feel nothing  i am completely numb to all feelings or emotion  ends aren t meeting and i am not surviving  this disease is eating me alive and there s nothing i can do about it  how do you protect yourself from your own head  how do you survive  i feel myself fading faster every time i wake up  it s like the suffering never ends ,0

t3_dls5b9,lvl505,realizing your existance means nothing to people,no one misses you when you re alive and everyone will forget you when you re dead  i feel like my life means as little as a sand grain and i have no importance to anyone  i m simply a passerby if that  i try to be nice and kind and good but it never matters  i m just constantly forgotten and replaced  someone else is always more appealing or interesting  or they re just simply not you and that makes them good enough  something else will always be better than what you are  you can try to change but it doesn t matter  was this really what i was born to be  i really wonder what s wrong with me and if fixing it means disappearing  i m so tired,0

t3_dksgov,Tpzx_,pssd  i ve never been as serious about killing myself ,post ssri sexual dysfunction  sex talk  so  if you re uncomfortable turn away now    as if things couldn t have gotten worse    i already had depression  and it s still here so i don t know what the fuck the antis were supposed to be doing  if anything  because of an indirect consequences of them  i m way closer to suicide than when i started them   after i got off of them  suddenly it s like everything sexually about me crashed into a brick wall and was pronounced dead at the scene  at first i figured it was my normal burn out of just having too much too quickly and my body and brain was getting numb and bored to the same stuff happening over and over again  so  i took a break  it happens all the time  and i can come back within like a week or two and be better than ever    but  this time  i never got better  i took an entire month off of any sexual activity  maybe two  and  nothing  it s been close to five months since i ve felt anything at all  and five months just so happens to be how long ago i stopped taking ssris and antidepressants in general  even when i was on my antis  any attempt at getting off was almost always shut down  but there were a few moments in there where things were mediocre  this past year and a half  has been an absolute downfall for my sexuality  i feel so shitty  i can t get aroused  can t get wet  can t get turned on  can t orgasm  basically no fucking libido whatsoever    and what s crazy is that up before this  i had no issue with any sort of libido  it was up a fuckin  wall  in fact  has been for the last four years thanks to those  raging angsty teenager hormones   yes  i am a teenager  and no  that does not make me too young to talk about this  my sex life is as important and as valid as yours  i m not a little kid   even during the intense parts of my depression  which is known to mess with you sexually   i never had issues    i was fine today  until i came to the realisation that this is beyond the realms of normal  even for ssris  i ve only ever read about how  while  taking ssris it can affect your sex life  and a little bit after taking them too  like a few days or weeks   not five months  that s too long  google led me to pssd  which i know  i know   dont google your symptoms   but  it matches what i ve been going through perfectly  too perfectly  unfortunately  but  at least i ve found a name for it   pssd seems to be really fucking fluid with how long it can last for people  but from what i can tell  it seems to last on the longer side for most people  and a lot are probably gonna have it forever without some intense medication or changes in their lives  there s no known cure  it feels like depression  but for my vagina rather than my brain  it s absolutely awful    and  i ve seem to have gotten the lucky side of it  other people can apparently experience straight up pain  tingling  and numbness  like literal numbness  not just the figurative word     i m frustrated beyond words  not to mention  i was put on these when i was a kid  who didn t understand there were side effects to it  or any medication for that matter  but especially not sexual ones that i d feel and regret down the road  i had basically no say in this  and the few that i did have  i was too ignorant to make a half decent judgement   there s no way i m going on for the rest of my life like this  no fucking way  i can hardly stomach just two and a half more years of this  when i ll finally be an adult and be able to be taken seriously and can speak to a professional about it  i ve lived    and     years  just     and a big portion of it already feels ruined  sure  yeah  i ll have a job  friends  maybe a partner  maybe somehow a kid or two  but  there s still a whole big chunk of it taken out by probably never being able to have sex  or even get to try it for that matter  or ever being able to masturbate again  not to mention throw all of the other stuff i m already depressed about    before i get  those  kinds of comments from people  i know i m still a teen and sex shouldn t necessarily be the first thing on my mind  but my biggest issue is more of if this is a permanent thing    saying that i want to die is an understatement ,1

t3_dlsbwx,nowheresound,the stuck feeling ,i ve been dealing with depression for about seventeen years now  and the hardest feeling for me is still feeling  stuck    i have a job i don t hate  but it is exhausting and unpredictable and doesn t pay the bills  i lost my old job that i super hated back in february  and with it my health insurance  so i had to stop taking my antidepressants  even then i couldn t afford therapy  so i definitely can t now  i don t have a degree and desperately want to go back to school  but have just enough in delinquent student loans that i feel i can never make that right get funding again  i failed out of college twice because of undiagnosed major depression    anxiety    ocd which was diagnosed but not treated   when i look back on my time in college it truly feels like a nightmare  one where all the walls are melting into time and space and i can t even trust my own mind or body    i hate my personality and have about four friends  two of whom live near me and one of whom is moving to the other side of the world in a few months  i hate everything about my looks and body  and sometimes feel violently sick after thinking about seeing myself in the mirror    i like art and writing but trying to work on anything massively triggers my feelings of worthlessness and pointlessness    i don t feel like there s anything i can do  beyond making things better  just to make things okay  the worst part is  i ve only gotten to the point of being suicidal once  like seven years ago  and i didn t do it bc i didn t want people to have nothing worth remembering me for  so like  i get to just be nothing forever  and if i did get to that point  then i get to be the asshole who ruined people s lives by killing herself  people are always like   oh  don t you want to live to see  thing  happen   and yeah  i do  that s the problem  i have to live through a hundred days feeling like this to see one day feeling like that  a hundred days that each feel like a thousand years to see one day that makes me feel   not even normal  but fleetingly happy    i don t want to go to bed because then i have to lay alone with my thoughts  but i don t want to stay awake  because it feels like my life has become nothing but tending to my anxiety and depression  you know how  when you talk to a counselor  they re always like  can you distract yourself    sure  i can  but that s all i do  i m just  fully  stuck  and at this point  i ve been stuck for so long  what s the point of getting unstuck ,0

t3_dld2vo,SeanMcQueen,i clearly don t deserve a future,hi friends   today i found out that i was not admitted into the uni i worked so hard to get into  it s been my driving force for getting better in many aspects of my life  and has requires many sacrifices of relationships with family and friends  as well as time to prepare myself for my application  i was so proud of myself to manage being top     on the sat with a perfect gpa  i was hard work  but it kept me going    i didn t make it in  hundreds of hours of my life cleaning up myself  torturing myself  and picking up the pieces again  all the while sacrificing countless aspects of myself  i punished myself when i didn t adhere to standards i forced myself into  and it wasn t enough   today i had a huge fight with my mother  who i will now be living with for another year or until i move out  for more reasons than i could fit into a post  i ll just say that she s the catalyst for the absolute best and worst parts of my life   i think i lost my best friend today as well  not to death though  prolonged issues were finally too much to handle today  i ve made the decision to separate him from my life  one of my only remaining friends   ironically  the friend and mother situations were before i got that dreaded email   so overall  i m not proud of myself  i m just as worthless as i always was  i do deserve any pain or suffering i get  because i m not worth anything  i ve known this for a long time  but my last hope to prove myself and start over was stripped from me  and it s my fault  i m simply not good enough for anything  this being the final straw   i ve got my knife next to me  i m waiting to break my   months     this is a post i created and saved as a draft     days ago because i was too scared to post  i wanted to share it  i did not cut  and still haven t  no it hasn t gotten better  though i am emotionally maturing more and more  it still hurts   ,0

t3_dlcuub,SI0-Retr0,struggling,hi i m new here  new to reddit even   but i thought i d make an account because i m struggling and you are all strangers to me anyways so i ll probably go unnoticed  the truth is i really don t know how much longer i can go on   i have so many goals and desires    dreams i wish i could fulfill  and yet i m trapped within myself unable to do any of it  i can t even do things i enjoy anymore  it s getting so bad that i can t even manage to get homework done on time or correctly and my grades in college are suffering  if i fail my one shot to get higher education will be gone and i ll be stuck paying off that debt and living a meager existence that i will hate and hate myself every day of  i m afraid of what i ll do to myself once that level of stability falls apart  i m probably harsher on myself than anyone else is  as most people are  but i live in constant fear every day that i will make that one mistake that will cause everything to collapse and constantly downplay myself and everything i do or i become overconfident in my abilities to compensate for how insecure i am   i m in the midst of potentially receiving diagnosis for add and depression but like my dad i am probably very hard to diagnose because i m pretty smart and not a problem maker i m sorry if that makes me sound like a braggart and i hope something of use is at least gleaned from the results because i can t  fix  myself anymore and the feeling of worthlessness  lethargy  and deep unknown sadness is getting more frequent and stronger as the weeks go on   i ve thought of suicide  how much better the world would be without me and yet i can t make myself do it  i ve never even attempted it  but the thought that i don t know whether suicide is courageous or cowardly anymore scares me   i ve told myself  your parents will get over it  and  just do it  not like you were worth much anyways   it s weird  i pace around and talk to myself like a madman  like some sort of psychic split has occurred and i m waging war with the worst of myself and i lose ground every day   part of me believes that i shouldn t complain about these problems that  there are so many people that need more help than you do  stop complaining   i find it difficult to voice my problems hence i m here where no one will know me  i had a good childhood with loving parents who argued very little and an amazing  ambitious  and wonderful younger sister all of whom i love to no end  so why should i be feeling this way  what kind of messed up self pity am i voicing here  and why should anyone care if i die  they ll get over it and be stronger in the end  i would have done my job making the world a better place by leaving it  i didn t even graduate high school with any practical hobbies or skills so what could i have added to the world anyways by living   i m sorry for the rant like post i am going through the motions  heck i m pretty sure few will see this or care but perhaps it is one of the few ways i can stay sane till i can get some help  in some sort of subconscious last ditch effort before going under by whatever last remnants of my will moved me to type this  i apologize for my hellish grammar in advance  never really got better at that   tl dr  if that even applies in this subreddit  i suffer in silence  i m failing to actualize myself  thought of offing myself  potentially have add  shouldn t have a reason to complain  i m losing ground in the war against myself  and i don t want to live in fear and hatred of myself and life anymore     like i can make myself change that anymore   apologies for the rant   i hope this finds you all in a better place than me  retr ,1
t3_dlej4s,erinbakespie,feeling like a selfish fraud,i m spiraling in this mental loop  realizing i ve been incredibly selfish for being absorbed in my own problems and neglecting my loved ones  i feel like i ve been a horrible person  it s so hard to engage in conversation because i can t focus and i ll forget what s just been said  i can t get myself to even pretend to care about anything and my family and my friends deserve better    the only solution my brain is offering is complete escape  i m luckily not feeling suicidal but i m feeling like it would be better for everyone if i just disappeared and i cannot think of another alternative  i need to get out of my relationships before everyone realizes i m a fraud and a shitty person   sorry for the rant  i know logically i could bring this up to them but it feels like it s been going on for so long that at this point i actually am that horrible selfish person and i d just be making excuses for myself  i don t know  thanks for reading,0

t3_dl0dbf,amycampbell00,closer than i ve ever been to giving up,i need to stop stringing myself along  expecting things to get better  they won t  i need to stop being fucking delusional   i m in my second year of college  struggling massively because my depression has sapped all of my motivation  i m broke because i can t keep a job  and it s now gotten to the point where i m struggling to afford lunch every day  all i want to do is lie in bed and play video games  or kill myself  that too    i just feel so fucking alone  i like to think people would care if i  did  die  but i know that s too much to ask  life would go on  and i d be forgotten about  and that s incredibly tempting ,1
t3_dkpnpg,sOmwhereElse,had another bad dream about suicide  woke up feeling worse,i don t know if it s okay for me to talk about a dream here  but as you can tell by the title it is about suicide    i had replied to someone a little while ago saying how i had two dreams about suicide  one i don t remember exactly how i went about it and the other i had a gun  i guess that sparked my subconscious or whatever because i had a really bad dream this morning about my family being killed somehow  everyone but my dad was just gone  though i knew they were dead  and my dad was lying dead on the living room floor  i ve been holding off of suicide for a long time because i want a quick and painless way out  but because my whole family was dead and i couldn t possibly live without them i was deliberating stabbing myself with a kitchen knife throughout the whole dream  i came really close a few times in the dream  but i decided to wait until evening   i woke up after this dream still feeling like i had to go to the kitchen and plunge a knife into myself  the dream was so vivid and i thought it was actually happening     i just wanted to tell this to someone even if no one replies  i hope it s okay i posted this here  if it s not i can take it down ,1

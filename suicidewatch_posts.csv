Since then I have just become more aware that I have a problem but I have not taken the necessary steps to actually getting better. I spent some time travelling, moved to a couple of different places where I could live and work close to nature thinking that maybe I need to be spend more time outdoors. I've gone on 1 month+ long hiking trips. I've done that things I thought would help since I don't want to take pills. I'm pretty adamant about not taking pills. I really believe there is a more holistic approach to improving my mental health. The only time I feel better is when I'm romantically involved with someone or am in love. And I don't think that being with someone solves my problems but the positive feelings I experience during my time with my partner are so powerful that my negative feelings are outweighed. But then when they are not around I try and find constant distractions. I'll call all my friends and talk on the phone  for hours or I'll go on tinder and chat with other men (I am not in a monogamous relationship so I am not hurting anyone by being active on tinder). My point is that I am trying to fill any time alone I have with other people. I guess I just hate being alone with myself.

Since then I have just become more aware that I have a problem but I have not taken the necessary steps to actually getting better. I spent some time travelling, moved to a couple of different places where I could live and work close to nature thinking that maybe I need to be spend more time outdoors. I&amp;#39;ve gone on 1 month+ long hiking trips. I&amp;#39;ve done that things I thought would help since I don&amp;#39;t want to take pills. I&amp;#39;m pretty adamant about not taking pills. I really believe there is a more holistic approach to improving my mental health. The only time I feel better is when I&amp;#39;m romantically involved with someone or am in love. And I don&amp;#39;t think that being with someone solves my problems but the positive feelings I experience during my time with my partner are so powerful that my negative feelings are outweighed. But then when they are not around I try and find constant distractions. I&amp;#39;ll call all my friends and talk on the phone  for hours or I&amp;#39;ll go on tinder and chat with other men (I am not in a monogamous relationship so I am not hurting anyone by being active on tinder). My point is that I am trying to fill any time alone I have with other people. I guess I just hate being alone with myself. But I know that I need to love myself in order to get better but I just don&amp;#39;t want to do that work.

I'll be honest with you, I have not even touched the assignment since my last email to you. I have had no motivation, I can barely focus or even get out of bed. 

I am going insane with all my midterms coming up and clearly im not cut out for university, but im trying.

Im doing my best to keep my mental state as stable as possible.

I won't touch the assignment atleast until my midterms are over for the sake of my mental well being.

I don't expect you to understand.

If I have to receive a 0 on the assignment, so be it as I will not be putting myself at risk as I have done so in the past.

TL;dr , You won't be receiving the legal research report atleast until my midterm are done (if allowed, and if not, I fully understand)

I am 20 year old male, and for as long as I can remember, I haven’t felt much of anything. I have no motivations, I have no desires. Every day is a chore because I know there is no end to it. Every day I get up to go to my same old part-time job, and study for the same old exams I couldn’t care less about passing. I’ve never had any relationships beyond temporary flings because I know I can never love them the way they deserve. It’s not that I literally can’t feel any happiness, or even any pain. It’s just weaker, it’s like my emotions, while not completely gone, are just extremely dulled. Any small amount of happiness or pain I feel is fleeting and I simply go back to the status quo. 

I used to be indifferent to the thought of death, it was easier to live than to find an excuse to kill myself, and deal with the pain I would cause to my family and friends. But now it’s just getting tiring, and I don’t want to live the rest of my life experiencing this hellish monotony. It’s just getting worse as I age. Following the parkland shooting, Florida (my state), changed the minimum age to purchase a handgun to 21 years old. If it were not for this, I would’ve killed myself already, but then this fucker had to go and ruin everything with his murder fetish. So here I am, for another year. 

I don’t know if I have any right to complain, so many people here suffer real pain, real tragedies, and my biggest problem is that I don’t care enough. I don’t know if I can change, or if I even want to be “saved”. But I just wanted to be honest with someone, anyone, about how I really feel instead of bottling it up and flashing a smile.

I didn't understand why at first, because it was simply a story out of millions. The book consists of a boy watching his mother slowly rot away due to cancer. He's all alone, and is taking on the role of cook, cleaner, and nurturer within the household. As his mother ever so slowly falls into the arms of death, things begin showing up. His estranged father who lives in the States, his hardskinned grandmother who tries to treat him like a normal young boy, bullies who pick on him and call him a loser, and so fourth. He is in a deep pain, and feels invisible.

One night, a monster calls to him from outside his window. The boy was terrified and frightened, but at the same time extremely pissed off. The yew tree monster threatens the boy, saying how he will tell him three stories in the coming weeks. When the third tale is told, the boy must tell the fourth. The boy, much smaller than the monster stands up to it, screaming his mother is dying, and this tree wants to tell him stories?! 

Three tales are told, the first talks about how life is not as simple as we might believe it to be.

The second is about one's ethics and morals, and how even in your darkest moments, you must stand for what you believe in.

The third talks of an invisible man. ""For if no one sees you, are you really there at all?"" The man grew tired of being invisible, and made sure everyone saw him.

The boy was told by the yew tree monster that if he were to listen to the tales, then his mother would be given a branch from his tree. An attempt at a cure; his mother's last hope. If anything could heal her, it would be the tree.

As promised, the doctors administered the last hope into the mother's veins, but it did not work. The boy heard the news and ran through the cemetery, to the hill that held the tree. Kicking it, punching it, and screaming with a red face and tears running down his cheeks that the monster PROMISED it would save his mother. It promised.

Springing to life, the tree rose from the ground and told the boy that if it could have healed her, it would have. She is simply too sick.

""No, no, NO. YOU PROMISED."" The monster looked towards the boy and said it was time for the fourth tale. The wind picked up and the nightmare the boy had been having for weeks materialized. A crack tore the ground in two, and he saw his mother hanging on ever so desperately to a branch that stuck out from the cliff wall. The boy ran to her and grabbed her arm, using all his strength to try and pull her to safety. 

The monster watched as the events unfolded, and told the boy to tell the fourth tale. To tell the truth he has been holding in.

""NO!"" The boy screamed over the howling wind. ""NO, I WON'T.""

""TELL THE TRUTH,"" The monster screamed back. His mother was slipping out of his hands. ""I WILL DIE IF I SAY IT,"" screamed the boy.

""YOU WILL DIE IF YOU DON'T. TELL THE TRUTH. TELL IT, TELL THE TRUTH!""

""I JUST WANT IT TO BE OVER.""

And everything stopped, and the mother was gone.

""I just can't stand, to see her like that anymore. I just, want everything to be over.""

The boy let himself fall into the ravine, but the monster caught him, and carried him back to the hill.

""You simply wished for an end to your pain, and that Conor O' Malley, is the most human wish of all"".

That night his mother died. Before she left, he told her the truth, that he loved her so much, and it is okay for her to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

We never find out if the monster was real, but this book has stuck with me throughout the years. I did not tell anyone this story to attempt and change how they view death. It's just I'm not feeling too good right now, and somehow I always seem to wander to this book every time I get here.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You simply wished for an end to your pain, and that Conor O&amp;#39; Malley, is the most human wish of all&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night his mother died. Before she left, he told her the truth, that he loved her so much, and it is okay for her to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never find out if the monster was real, but this book has stuck with me throughout the years. I did not tell anyone this story to attempt and change how they view death. It&amp;#39;s just I&amp;#39;m not feeling too good right now, and somehow I always seem to wander to this book every time I get here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is fucking rough, and even though my monster has never came, I like to think that maybe I can become one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope whoever reads this will find their own story too.&lt;/p&gt;

I spend hours laying in one spot thinking about dying. 

My friends left me when I became their boss at work, my partner just dumped me because I have too much going on, I’m broke and my solution to not having money is to be a sugar baby but I feel filthy because I’ve been sexually assaulted and never dealt with the trauma, my ex from several years ago is saying I stabbed him (that never happened, he’s currently having a psychotic break. he sexually assaulted me and I dumped him. That was it), I was in ANOTHER car accident, and I failed a practical (frisbee, it’s a blow off course) because I was mourning the death of my friend who got hit by a car cycling in September. My bio mom told me she doesn’t want anything to do with my, my dad and step mom don’t want me if I’m trans (‘you’re a monster destroying our daughter’). 

My life has always been hard. I’ve been verbally, physically, and psychologically abused for much of it. I’ve been sexually assaulted four times.

Fucking. Tired. I can’t push through it anymore. My counsellor wanted to take me to the hospital yesterday but I managed to talk through things because I knew if I went to the hospital I couldn’t kill myself. 

I took too many pills and I’m still alive. I got a little carried away with self harm and then didn’t treat it for a good hour hoping things would just end. I can’t do this anymore.

the rest of my family have been very distant. they only really recognized/cared about how i was feeling when i failed in college, 8 years after i started becoming very isolated and depressed. i have not spoken to a single person i met from ages 14-18 since i left school. i would literally sit at the dinner table in near silence everyday unless spoken to for about 4 years. i didn't receive a single pep talk from any of them during this period. i don't know whether or not to blame this on their character or their stupidity. they're nice enough that they don't deserve my death, but they certainly don't deserve for me to stay alive when i'm suffering, sure of my decision, and ready to leave.

they're decent people, but i hate being around my family. i feel like i share nothing in common with them besides blood. they have no interest in the outside world or anything that takes time and energy to grasp or understand, despite being in the top 1% globally of people who have the opportunity to do that. it's work/sports/television and repeat. they are wilfully stupid and unhappy people. the only things i ever feel i have in common with my family are my faults: stupidity, sensitivity, and indifference. it would be alot easier for me to maintain a distant but workable relationship with my family if i wasn't depressed, but i don't feel a desire to do it like i used to. 

i'm probably a drug addict. i usually take modest doses of amphetamines, kratom, and alcohol everyday compounded by an unholy amount of nicotine. i've tried being sober, and it's extremely disappointing. it's as if i can see how shitty my life is more vividly, but no will to change anything about it returns to me at all. i can't think clearly or remember things like i could just a few years ago, and i'm making it worse everyday. i've tried 10+ medications from my psychiatrist, 3 therapists, rTMS, self-administered ketamine therapy, exercise, etc. nothing helps AT ALL, not even enough for me to bother continuing with it.

I have no idea what I am going to do after college and I haven’t cultivated a network or done anything noteworthy since enrolling three years ago. I’m a business major. That should tell you enough.

So that’s that. But I found out recently that my boyfriend has been messaging guys on gay hookup apps for a half a year, as well as secretly indulging in a sissy fetish to the point where he joined several discord servers for it and read sissy and feminization guides. I just feel like a sack of garbage knowing my boyfriend wanted to go out and suck cock dressed as a lady, sending pictures of his bare ass to random men, and all the while assuring me he would never cheat on me and that he wasn’t gay. He still claims he’s not gay and he finds me attractive. Btw, I found out all this the DAY AFTER our anniversary. You wanna know what it’s like to feel worthless? Just catch your boyfriend messaging transwomen and gay men telling them he would like to be pounded and suck their cocks like a worthless slut whore. His words, not mine. Cheating and horrible disgusting misogyny rolled into one. And I thought this man was the one who would stick by me no matter what. He is the person I am closest to and I’ve told him EVERYTHING about my childhood and mental health issues. Now it is all gone.

On top of all this, I have major depression which I suspect may be misdiagnosed OCD, and childhood emotional abuse trauma in bucketloads. I feel like every single time I have managed to climb the hill of depression, something has dragged me down before I can stabilize myself. 

For example, my dear dog was killed by my mother’s dog this year, and we had to put both of them down. He was my best friend for 11 years. I even had a lucid dream where I pet him just like old times, but I knew it was a dream because I knew he was supposed to be dead.

Also, the friends I have currently are either pieces of shit, or the good ones live too far away to see. I have tried all semester to make friendships with new people but it’s so hard. I am not an outgoing social butterfly. In fact, the extreme opposite. But I’ve put myself out there despite it being so tiring and hopeless.

I just wish I could have had a say in whether I was born or not. If I had had the choice to review my full life before being born, I would have said no. I am only passively suicidal - if I got hit by a car and killed, I wouldn’t really mind, but I am too weak to carry it out myself.

He's like you know, people overdose on these.

I flipped. And I said why would you say something like that????

He said. no no You won't do this, you're future focused so I'm sure you wont try this.

Since then, I've been F'd up. The entire reason I took suicide completely out of my mind as it cannot be an option was that there's no easy and certain way of doing it.

I'm screwed. These thoughts aren't leaving my head. Please help.

I can't get over what this person did to me during childhood and the voices and the turbulence i went through while growing up. My siblings were horrible to me. No one protected me.

Emotional intimate eye contact sex moment
Set to tell her I love her but hold back because fear burdening her with emotional intensity
Keep waiting

Anxiety returns

Vomit and embarrassed
Open up to girlfriend about it
Understanding but says fears of past experiences with ex of bad mental health returning
Asks to speak with talk of not being able to do relationship
Immediately panic like old times suspecting complete cold end of relationship but compose self with past lessons
Make it about her feelings not mine
She arrives visibly upset and doesn’t deal well with emotions in person despite strong independent demeanour
Sit her down and calm her with tv and ask her to speak to me and that I’m listening that I’m here for her
She surprisingly ignores me, body language distant, suddenly continues to speak about tv
I take this as her way of telling me she isn’t ready to talk about it after difficult day at hospital
Give her space and hope to speak about it soon
She begins going quiet and more quiet with me over next 2 weeks (to 20/10/2019)

Heightening quickly 
Overwhelmed and trapped

Love my girlfriend with all my heart
Getting better will be for me but going to do it so I can be there for her
Passed to psychiatric team with same old advice but something at least

Girlfriend still quiet
So confused
Set to push on to chat but things come up in both schedules
Still only 2 weeks from initial chat of her raising feeling badly
Determined to be there for her, can’t give her any more time, needs sorted or fearing relationship will end but only 2 weeks and first face to face conversation should help sort it
Cancels on coming round to see me yesterday
Clearly stressed
Then tells me over Facebook messenger feelings of break up being necessary
What? Still to speak? So confused.
First emotional conversation together is about breaking up
She says she struggles speaking about emotions in person
Fucked up. No communication.
Unimaginable pain, everything I rebuilt comes crashing down

Continue speaking with her over messenger
Thought of goodbye makes her feel “crazy”
Felt we were strong
Cares so much for me
Stresses of work
I mention need to speak
She says she has wanted to but it hasn’t happened
I ask why she didn’t when I asked her
***SHE DIDNT HEAR ME ASK HER***
***LAST 2 WEEKS BEEN LIVING UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OF SAME SITUATION WANTING THE SAME THING****
****COMPLETE MESS. TONE CHANGES COMPLETELY. MASSIVE. CHANGED EVERYTHING. SURELY WORTH FIXING IF HONEST MISTAKES ON BOTH PART***
***TO GO FROM 100% TO 0% IN 2 WEEKS WITH FINAL DECISION AND STILL NO CONVERSATION IS NOT FAIR OR RIGHT***
***WE BOTH DESERVE TO BE LOVED****

She is coming round to tell me about her current want to break up in person after work on thursdsy 
But have to go with my gut
She is hurting
I am hurting
She is stressed
I am stressed
Complete miscommunication destroying the beautiful thing we share
Need to listen
Need to listen more than I speak
Need to emphasise and sympathise
Need to understand and recognise her hurt and pain
Need to put her first
But
Need to tell her I love her
Will be telling her I love her
Need to swing for the fences
Distant approach while done by reason has failed me
She needed affection not hesitancy
Im a coward
Internally know this is my last chance at happiness and life
And I won’t have it taken from me without a fight
because of misunderstanding and everything I’ve fought for her since I stood at a bridge and held month of tablets my hand

Reality check: Very likely it won’t matter what I say

When it’s done
I’m done

Emotional state of break up will make returning to work under existing cold horrible Uk civil service system impossible. Won’t be able to function. Will lead to loss of job. Will lead to loss of friendships. Will lead to disappointment of family. Will leave me penniless and homeless. Will leave me alone. Unwanted and unloved.

Not a case of I can anymore. It’s a case of whether I want to anymore.

Without her and without job, I don’t want to anymore.
This is not an isolated life event
This has snowballed since my 12th birthday
People are broken up with and feel sad then recover
I get that
Not isolated incident. Lifetime of misery
26 now
Nothing ever changes
I’m broken

Zopiclone sleeping pills prescribed easily in past for depression related insomnia. Lamotrigine overdose more difficult and risky. Get prescription then Go to field so family don’t find me. So sorry.

Suicide notes written
Plan completed
Spend time with family and friends
Don’t eat all day so pills can be absorbed quickly
Get night alone
Shave, put on best shirt, smell nice, last shower,, go to shop and get favourite southern comfort
Walk to fields nearby and find private resting place
drink in beautiful Scottish skyline
Take all pills with full bottle alcohol 
Send out suicide notes on phone
Say goodbye
Close my eyes
find peace.

Unimaginable pain, everything I rebuilt comes crashing down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continue speaking with her over messenger
Thought of goodbye makes her feel “crazy”
Felt we were strong
Cares so much for me
Stresses of work
I mention need to speak
She says she has wanted to but it hasn’t happened
I ask why she didn’t when I asked her
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SHE DIDNT HEAR ME ASK HER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LAST 2 WEEKS BEEN LIVING UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OF SAME SITUATION WANTING THE SAME THING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*
*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMPLETE MESS. TONE CHANGES COMPLETELY. MASSIVE. CHANGED EVERYTHING. SURELY WORTH FIXING IF HONEST MISTAKES ON BOTH PART&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TO GO FROM 100% TO 0% IN 2 WEEKS WITH FINAL DECISION AND STILL NO CONVERSATION IS NOT FAIR OR RIGHT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WE BOTH DESERVE TO BE LOVED&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is coming round to tell me about her current want to break up in person after work on thursdsy 
But have to go with my gut
She is hurting
I am hurting
She is stressed
I am stressed
Complete miscommunication destroying the beautiful thing we share
Need to listen
Need to listen more than I speak
Need to emphasise and sympathise
Need to understand and recognise her hurt and pain
Need to put her first
But
Need to tell her I love her
Will be telling her I love her
Need to swing for the fences
Distant approach while done by reason has failed me
She needed affection not hesitancy
Im a coward
Internally know this is my last chance at happiness and life
And I won’t have it taken from me without a fight
because of misunderstanding and everything I’ve fought for her since I stood at a bridge and held month of tablets my hand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reality check: Very likely it won’t matter what I say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it’s done
I’m done&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emotional state of break up will make returning to work under existing cold horrible Uk civil service system impossible. Won’t be able to function. Will lead to loss of job. Will lead to loss of friendships. Will lead to disappointment of family. Will leave me penniless and homeless. Will leave me alone. Unwanted and unloved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a case of I can anymore. It’s a case of whether I want to anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without her and without job, I don’t want to anymore.
This is not an isolated life event
This has snowballed since my 12th birthday
People are broken up with and feel sad then recover
I get that
Not isolated incident. Lifetime of misery
26 now
Nothing ever changes
I’m broken&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zopiclone sleeping pills prescribed easily in past for depression related insomnia. Lamotrigine overdose more difficult and risky. Get prescription then Go to field so family don’t find me. So sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suicide notes written
Plan completed
Spend time with family and friends
Don’t eat all day so pills can be absorbed quickly
Get night alone
Shave, put on best shirt, smell nice, last shower,, go to shop and get favourite southern comfort
Walk to fields nearby and find private resting place
drink in beautiful Scottish skyline
Take all pills with full bottle alcohol 
Send out suicide notes on phone
Say goodbye
Close my eyes
find peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly there&lt;/p&gt;

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

This is going to be weird and written poorly as I just spill thoughts from my head onto the page. I don't know where to begin or how to say it, so I'm just going to mash the keyboard and get it out there. I'm hoping that among you there's a kind person to offer some words of wisdom. 

So I'm depressed to the point where I don't see any point in going on. I'm spending my days in my own little bubble just going through the motions. I get up and go to work where I'm a senior compliance officer for an online gambling company. I live on a small and admittedly beautiful island that I do consider myself very lucky to call home. I have a large family (9 children from the same parents) and we are very close. By all accounts I should be very happy with the life that I have. And that's the problem right there. I know I should be happy. There are many, many people in the world who are very happy and are not as fortunate as I am to have the upbringing and life in general that I have. But for some reason I find myself increasingly lost. I take very little joy out of my daily routine and very often distract myself with video games and smoking marijuana. This doesn't make me happy as such. It simply distracts me from the thought of having to get up the next day and do the same old routine all over again.   


Let's try and add some more depth to this miserable story. I'm sure right now people are considering me ungrateful and a whiny little shit. Don't worry, I think that of myself too. I mean how can I be so selfish as to squander these gifts I've been given? I don't know and I hate myself for it. 

So. As I said. I live on a small island where I have a relatively good job. It doesn't pay amazingly but it's not bad. Unfortunately for the last 10 years (approximately) I have been in debt and doing nothing but living payday to payday. I found myself shutting myself in doors drinking and gambling heavily. I would finish work in the office and go back to my tiny ground floor flat (apartment for my colonial cousins) where I'd drink to the point of passing out and waking up in the morning to see not how much I'd won, but simply how much money I'd taken out. One time I took out a loan via my online banking and didn't even realise I had done so until a few weeks later. I was low, so low. I then started to worry about money even more to the point that I was getting into so much unnecessary debt and I couldn't find a way to stop. I had definitely developed both a gambling and a drinking problem by the time I was 25. Fuck, where did it all go wrong? 

I have been a long-time sufferer of anxiety which has resulted in me developing IBS which triggers when I get anxious. And you know what makes me anxious? The fear of getting anxious and shitting myself quite literally whilst walking to work or anywhere. I don't like taking long car journey's (basically anything over 10 minutes) and regularly cancel events I would actually very much like to attend just so that I can avoid the embarrassment of an event that will likely never happen. This has cost me relationships, jobs and I think many of the greatest years of my life. Or so I'm told (I seriously hope not). All that lost, because I can't stop being a nervous little shit.

The scariest thing about all this is that I know that people around me have no idea that I feel like this all the time. I always hide behind a jokey facade and smile and laugh and do nice deeds and help people. That's what I'm meant to do right?  


Recently I've started thinking about life and what is the point of this? I'm suffering to live a life that probably means nothing in the grand scheme of things. I don't believe in an afterlife. I think that once your time has ended you simply cease to be. Your body will remain but even that will fade in time and nobody will remember you once your family have passed on. So why do we do this to ourselves? Why go to work and make someone else money? Why worry about what anyone thinks of you? Ultimately we'll all be lost to the annuls of time with noone to remember our deeds or achievements. Even if they could remember, what does it matter to me? I'll be dead. I won't be able to enjoy any of it in any way. So why bother trying to succeed? Why bother caring what anyone thinks of you? Why bother doing anything at all? NOTHING MATTERS.   


Why should I put myself through all this pain on a daily basis? All I do is watch everyone around me grow up and do all the things I've been told and am still told I should be doing. Get a girlfriend, buy a house, settle down, get in shape, work hard, have a family, and all the other things in life that I now see are completely and utterly pointless and nothing but a waste of time. But then, if that's all pointless, then what should I do with my time? I have time and nothing else. That is how I feel. Nothing but time and emptiness. So why not just take all of this medication the doctors have put me on all at once and put an end to the suffering?   


The only reason I haven't done so already is because I do still care about my family and friends. I know that me doing that would make them suffer and I don't want to do that. But would they really want me to suffer in silence and know that the only reason I don't end it all is because I don't want them to be sad like I am? Would they consider that fair?   


I know that they would try to help me find a way back to the flock, but right now I don't see a way back and to be honest I'm not sure I want a way back. Why would I put all that effort into something that ultimately doesn't seem to matter in the slightest? 

&amp;#x200B;

I could have said a lot more and offered more detail and a greater insight into my warped little world.   


I saw Joker the other day and I was sat there thinking ""I wonder if anyone else is relating to this on the same level as I am?"". Not the violence, but the sad little world he lived in. Nobody realising what he's going through or caring.  


Please someone tell me what I should do.

I asked if we were still together and we would remain loyal and no dating or anything of the sorts. She agreed. She left and I was in agony. I felt like the world was collapsing in.

She told me she went to a friends house, and then to a co workers house. (She has no close friends). She got drunk at the co workers house and slept with him. I find out and lose it. We eventually calm down and I say that I’m willing to forgive her and if she’s willing to go to couples therapy. She agreed instantly and we just held each other. 

Today as I woke up and finding some therapy locations she came out and said that she’s still not sure if she’s happy. She said we have (had) a perfect life with perfect pets, location etc. but she’s not happy where she is. I then told her what do we do? After lots of talking she is unsure if she still loves me and wants to take time to think about it. In 2 weeks she’s going to let me know if she still has feelings and if I do.

I was recently diagnosed with PTSD. It explains why since my trauma I feel like my brain has been warped to the point where I’ll never experience a coherent thought ever again. I won’t go one day without having a panic attack. Who knows how many days and therefore panic attacks I have left if I don’t choose the number myself? We euthanize animals when it’s been decided for them that there is too much anguish for them to live a good quality of life. And I know what’s best for myself because I feel the pain today and and know what I have looking forward.

I’m 16. I don’t want to spend the next 50-60 years of my estimated lifespan waking up in the morning and facing the pain I feel today over and over again until I die of natural causes. The time I have left naturally is too long to just tough it out. 

So, like I said earlier, I need to get some things straightened out. 

A firearm is the perfect exit route. Quick, easy, and hard to mess up. If only I had one or knew someone who did. I can’t do this because I can’t even buy one until I’m legal. 

Drowning and hanging are tricky because someone will have to find me and they have a low success rate. I would feel guilty about a stranger having to see that.

Cutting/overdosing are also not reliable enough. I’m a cutter and I know that I would probably back out and give up because I wouldn’t be able to cut deep enough.

Jumping from a tall building is likely to work and doesn’t require much to execute, but like I said earlier, I would feel bad for the person who found me.

I have no clue what my purpose is nor do I know what I want for my life or even why I am bothering with college when I am starting to hate what I used to love thanks to sucking at it and seeing that everyone around me even new people to the college which might I add I have being doing computer science courses for 4 fucking years. They are already better than me and while i hear them type away and build programs and work on the material here I am just fucking sat there not able to work on anything. Just goes to show how fucking useless I am at something should be excelling in. Four years and I am still a retard. I dont know whos joke it was to put me on this piece of shit planet and have to suffer constantly from losing family members and friends to having a shit appearance and fail at getting even decent grades. I am sick of being called dramatic by my mother who ironically suffers from PTSD and depression herself just brushes it off as a part of my personality or some bullshit. I am honestly fed up with all this shit I just want to sleep I am so god damn tired. Oh yeah and dont let me forget I am still a damn virign at 19 and havent even had a girlfriend like what even is the point of my life I honestly cant see it. Am I good at logic? Well if my programming has anything to say it would be nope. Am I good at drawing or being creative? Fuck no cant even learn how to draw properly with the drawing tablet I was gifted, its just gathering dust. Am I good at socialising? Nice joke there, if I was good at it I wouldnt have lost so many friends and dont expect to keep any I have currently just waiting for the day they leave like the rest of them. Am I good son to my parents? Nah I am a freeloading piece of shit that doesnt deserve jack shit my parents give me. They most certainly dont deserve a shitty son like me who cba finding a damn job.

I overdosed again and survived..I got back home and my wife officially left me and took our dog. 

Whilst I was in Florida I bought everyone presents to try remain civil - not a single thankyou or even a message.

My wife and I had a final ‘chat’ and are semi friends but during our talk, which her brother knew about, he kept messaging her...stating that I never tried to overdose / that he didn’t realise (he shouted at me and threatened to come beat me up and kept saying “how dare you” and calling me a liar that I never tried to kill myself etc). 

I didn’t even get the dignity to have a final conversation with my wife without interference/her actual full attention...I showed her the messages and missed calls etc as proof (literally stating I had overdosed) and she forgave him INSTANTLY. No questions asked, legit just acted like no cares given and said “I’m not getting involved”.

So yea, I unfortunately survived my overdose. I’ve been back for 4 days and a puppy local to me became available. My grandparents bought him for me to try give me a reason to live. I really am trying my best but the urges are coming back stronger than ever. 

Disassociative amnesia is what I was diagnosed with. Essentially due to my trauma I blackout and do something if I get too anxious/worked up. For example when my brother in law was shouting etc and threatening me &gt; i overdosed.

To not even trust yourself, especially when you now have a dependant animal on your hands, is terrifying.

Every ounce of me wants to just die. I’m forcing myself to be there for Newt (Harry Potter reference, massive fan of the books).

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t even get the dignity to have a final conversation with my wife without interference/her actual full attention...I showed her the messages and missed calls etc as proof (literally stating I had overdosed) and she forgave him INSTANTLY. No questions asked, legit just acted like no cares given and said “I’m not getting involved”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yea, I unfortunately survived my overdose. I’ve been back for 4 days and a puppy local to me became available. My grandparents bought him for me to try give me a reason to live. I really am trying my best but the urges are coming back stronger than ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disassociative amnesia is what I was diagnosed with. Essentially due to my trauma I blackout and do something if I get too anxious/worked up. For example when my brother in law was shouting etc and threatening me &amp;gt; i overdosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To not even trust yourself, especially when you now have a dependant animal on your hands, is terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every ounce of me wants to just die. I’m forcing myself to be there for Newt (Harry Potter reference, massive fan of the books). He is only 8 weeks old and needs support but I don’t know how long I can hold on&lt;/p&gt;

Dear Dad, 

There are many reasons that I shouldn't put this in writing, but I think the benefits far outweigh them. 

You reminded me when we spoke today of what it felt like to be in a quote-unquote rut. What I feel compelled to tell you  is that that term does not do the experience justice, not by a light year.
 
There were many times that I felt essentially certain that ,  because I was so miserable, that I was going to die naturally in the near future. I could not possibly continue to suffer this way and survive, therefore I did not have to bother with killing myself.
 
 Someone who is in a quote-unquote rut, like I was, needs more than anything to be told over and over by people that care that they are loved, that they have worth, that they are worth something to the world, and that they are not alone no matter how much they may feel so.
 
 I pass along this advice, or rather illustration, such that if you know anybody who knows someone who feels that way, or ever encounter it again in any person anywhere ,  that you will viscerally know that - that - is what they need more than anything, and being made to feel the opposite by anyone is reinforcing and only deepens the so called rut.
 
 I am sorry that on a day that was so wonderful with you that I find myself writing such a macabre and dark sounding email. But the truth is that this email is a beautiful and helpful and Illuminating thing, and I know that you can see that. I also am certain that you will understand what it takes to write an email like this, and how much love ,  trust , and respect it displays- in neon! - to the recipient.
 
 If you would please do me the favor of keeping in confidence that you heard these truths from me personally, I would be greatly appreciative. The choice of course is yours.
 
 I love you, and I love that I truly can feel love again  in this world.
 
 With the utmost sincerity,

I&amp;#39;m kind if a visionary and I spent my whole life thinking about the future and how cool i&amp;#39;d be but now I can&amp;#39;t even imagine living past 18. i&amp;#39;ve heard the &amp;quot;your still young&amp;quot; excuse too fucking often for it to have any effect on me. im also a stone in everyone&amp;#39;s life. it&amp;#39;s ALWAYS the same shit: i get to know them, we talk for awhile, they start to distance themselves from me and i realise  that i never meant whatever as much to them as they meant to me. i think it&amp;#39;s because i have attachement issues but most likely people just get bored of me. and after all that my pathetic ass still thinks i could restart a friendship lol. i hate being alone but i&amp;#39;m used to it and it&amp;#39;s the only way i can imagine. this post really went to a whole different direction than I originally planned and now i&amp;#39;m like more depressed as before just like every other time in my life..&lt;/p&gt;

I am 18 year old trans guy living in Lithuania- extremly homophobic and transphobic country, and the country highest rates of suicides in the Europe. Coming out is not an option, people will eat me alive, however, I do my best to look like a guy anyways. This, here, apparently is.not accepted. 
I have a friend who is also a trans guy, it is a miracle that I met this person, we became best friends, close like brothers. I will call him William.
Let me describe my daily life and encounters with people. I live in a grey, dark building like most of the buildings in lithuania. I will show you how it looks like, taken from Google. https://ibb.co/1QWsHjc
My mother and father are both alchoholics, I haven't seen them sober in a long while. While I feel bad for my mother sometimes, I hate it when she drinks. I could never make a piece with people who drink alchohol, I swore on my life to never drink a sip of that stuff just based on the fact that I grew up surounded by drunk people. I can't trust them. Drunk person is a different human being. I remember in my childhood memories I would always ask my drunk mother obvious questions like 'what's your name' or 'how old are you' just to make sure she is the same woman. 
My father doesn't care about us (me, my sister and my young brother). Maybe he does care about his youngest son, but barely. All his does is drink and watch Tv, all day long, All night long. He also works, I give him that, he supports the family by buying us food, paying the taxes and sometimes giving us 5€ for our personal use. He also is in deep deep debts, owning a bank quite a lot of money. But he never cares about how we are doing. I was never close to my father, quite the opposite, we argue a lot. 
I used to go to therapist for anxiety and Paranoia. I stopped going because I was soo anxious to go. I also have depression. Its scary to think where it can lead me Suicide is not the worst thing even, I am just scared of missing the opportinities and living here for ever, regreting everything. There are some better days, but I am are not happy or even close. It just feels a bit more managable, like you can wake up instead of doing nothing. Its not even lazyness. Its nothing like lazyness. You want to do it, and you are not even against it, you just physicly or mentally think you can not handle it at the moment, like if you go, you don't care if you just lay in the middle of the school, crouch the legs and sleep just to be away. And it used to be different. My anxiety would take over and i would need to do it, but now i feel like I can be axious all i want, I just can not do it. I want to read a books or watch a movie, but what is the point, I can not do it.
Today my neighbour stopped me when I went to the shop (I do not know any of my neighbours, not the names or faces, I have never spoken with them) and told me that people in the neighbourhood think that I am a lesbian. It hit me hard. People now are looking at us, me And William, listen to our conversations (We speak in english and hope to move out one day, but we have 0 money and work as an artists). They judge us. I do not know what to do. The neighbour woman was speaking right intk my face, her drunken breath was making me sick, she wouldn't let me go home, holding me by the arm. I had to mental strenght to say anything to her and she barely stood on her two legs of how drunk she was.
My parents do not think  that depression is a thing. They think I do it to bring attentiom to myself, and that is the last thing i want to do. It is getting worse each day. I can not manage my feelings on my own, I am too scared. Suicide seems like a prettiest way out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted this on mental health sub too.

My boyfriend raped me a few months ago. We were having an argument and somehow it needed upwith him on top of me pulling my pants down. At first I thought he was just playing but he kept going. 

He tried to to put his penis in me and I kept telling him to stop. 
And he just told me to take it like the slut I am. I was crying at the start but then I just stopped fighting and gave up. I just lay there as he had sex with me. He said he was going to cum in me ( I am not on the pill) and kept telling him not too. But he did anyway and I ended up taking Plan B/the morning after pill. 

He keeps denying it when I ever I bring it up. This one time he said I should be grateful that someone had sex with me coz I am so ugly and fat. 

I honestly don’t know why I let him treat me the way I do. I didn’t have the best childhood growing up. I was physically and emotionally abused by my parents as well as sexually assaulted by my cousin.

He has used every single insecurity I have had in my life  and made me feel so much worse. Yet I still love him. I know there is something wrong with me.

To want things. Stopped thinking negatively, been telling myself everything's fine, it's not that bad. But I'm not bouncing back anymore. Every day I'm closer to doing it; it's chipping away at me.

I don't feel I'm being irrational. I'm not depressed, I just don't want this life. I chose a hard path and now I don't want it anymore. But I chose it, I brought this on myself. So many days stretched out ahead of me, nothing to look forward to. Plenty of shitty memories to look back on. To keep me up at night and punctuate my thoughts throughout the day. Repress them you say? I'm good, but not that good. 

Then there are things I feel I might want, but know will never happen. I try to hold them ahead of me, like a donkey with a carrot, but I'm not even convinced those things would fix it anymore. I've been trying to distract myself, patch the emptiness, but it's not working. In fact, each failed effort is making it worse. Faking it 'til you make it isn't working, it's just making me more fake.

I think about it every day. Multiple times a day, usually. I have a plan, I just question my ability to carry it out, logistically. If I could just press a button and be done, that would be stellar. But I'm a baby who can't stand pain, so that complicates things. 

I don't ""need help"". There isn't another human alive who has the answers. I'm not being irrational. There's no rational reason to live if you don't want to. If you've genuinely tried already. It doesn't mean anything. You can be unhappy, and it can be justified. Doesn't mean you have a mental problem or are depressed. I don't, at least. Down a tonne of 5-HTPs like candy and it does nothing -- looks like my ~brain chemicals ~ are fine

Maybe it's circumstantial. But my circumstances aren't changing any time soon, and I don't think I can push through the next several years when the outcome isn't guaranteed. Even a sure thing wouldn't change my mind anymore, because I don't really want it. I've been trying for years and it's not working, I didn't just decide today. Waiting years is reasonable, no? 

Death comes to everyone; in the grand scheme of things what does shaving off 50yr really change? I understand why people are not suicidal. They know they're going to die eventually but they enjoy the journey. I do not. If that's their reason for living, it's understandable why I don't want to?

4 people will care that I'm gone. And I regret that that's the case, but it's not enough to keep me here anymore. I'm not sitting around waiting for things to get better. But it's been *years*. Surely that's a representative timeframe?

My family comes from a KKK hotbed on the east coast, I've slowly come to the conclusion my mother was enchanted by the taboo of black people because of her upbringing. 

She would only involve herself with black people, hung out in black neighborhoods, only dated black men. I believe she had a race fetish and I am the unfortunate product of that. Dad didn't stick around past maybe 8 years old.

I came out the unattractive type of mixed that society doesn't lust after: pale skin, black features, thin wavy hair, instead of ""caramel/mocha"" skin and Caucasian features and big thick hair. We lived in the city when I was first born, other kids were black,mixed, other types of POC. My racist family moved out of the city shortly after I was born because ""there's less crime in the suburbs and you'll have a yard to play in""

We moved to said KKK hotbed where they originated from, I think there were maybe 12 black people out of 24k people. 
My entire life has been hell ever since. I was neglected and kept morbidly obese, which helped produce a VERY premature puberty along with my black genetics being to blame for such event. From 6 years old my entire body has been covered in stretch marks and discoloration and ugly spotty pin needle like skin. My breasts were never firm or perky, they grew down instead of out. Other girls didn't even approach puberty until they were roughly 11/12/13. My entire life I lived as a physically deformed freak compared to all of my other youthful looking white classmates. 

Every time I would go to a doctor for some type of physical and they had to look at my body the doctors and nurses would lose their breathe and almost turn pale in shock. I've been diagnosed with folliculitis on my breasts because of the blatant gross spots that are present on them, other times it's ""because you're black"".

Fast forward to my teen and adult years, I lost all  100 lbs of the so called ""baby fat"". My entire body sags but for some reason my breasts were the only thing that took most of the damage. They're thin and wrinkly, completely deflated, and those stupid fucking dots all over my breasts are so much more apparent. I've been told countless times my breasts are hideous and deformed because of my black genetics. 

I've always felt guilt for dating white men, as if I were defiling them and their pure and healthy white genes. Most men are just completely repulsed by my topless figure, I'm always told ""I've never seen anything like that before"".

Recently I've started dealing with something called hidradenitis suppurativa or HS. It's an autoimmune disease that attacks my hair follicles, forcing them to blow up into very large boils, and it puts me into debilitating pain, unable to work, crying, unable to eat, and dizzy. The more research I do, the more I learn it's 3x more likely to happen to black women or mixed women.

I feel like I've been cursed, I barely have any will to live anymore. I'm living with CPTSD, anxiety, major depressive disorder, OCD, ADD and who know what else, majority of these being because of my upbringing. Oh and I've been balding at the temples since I was 19 like what seems to happen to a lot of black women. All of my lifelong pain has been because I'm not white. I feel alone and freakish and alienated. I live in poverty, unable to afford all the plastic surgery I want to look more youthful and white, I wake up overwhelmed with shame of being alive every single day. Not one single part of my life has been normal, pleasant, or average. The only thing that has ever helped me is drugs and alcohol. I'd love to know if anyone has has any type of similar experience or if I really am alone in this cruel mixed race adventure.

Graduated from uni with a useless degree in a downward spiralling economy with no internship experience (too depressed to go out most of the time for 4 years) so i can't find a job. Got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder early this year after my 2nd attempt. Been leaping from guy to guy, from shitty relationship to shittier relationships for as long as i've been dating.

Until i met my current boyfriend on the internet. He's amazing and makes me feel calm, keeps me grounded when my bpd flares up, really loves me and everything. I was so close to getting a job last week and everything seemed to be going fine and maybe i could see him in February after saving up - but they decided not to hire me because my city's 'political situation' is uncertain for the company.

Fuck.

My psychiatrist told me to take a break from job hunting because the last time i went for an interview, i had a mental breakdown and had to leave immediately. And now the stress of it all is coming back and i am so so scared of the future and how i will always be a piece of garbage who is better off dead. 

I was going to do it in September after i flew out to see my boyfriend. I was gonna go home, make some bs excuse and swallow all the psych meds i had, maybe down some vodka and try not to puke or something. 

But on thr very last day, my boyfriend broke down crying saying that he didn't wanna be away from me. It broke my heart and while i held him i wondered if i should really go through with it - and then he asked me, still sobbing, to not 'disappear' after i'd gone home.

I was shocked - how did he know? I never mentioned it to anyone, never even typed it out...

And i said, 'how did you know?' And he sobbed even more, saying 'you're going to do it aren't you - after how you said you wouldn't leave me, after how we talked about getting married and everything!'


I didn't know what to say. I promised not to do it.

But now, stress is triggering my bpd again and every night i think about jumping off the fucking building. I live on the 19th floor. It would be so easy. I could just grab a chair and jump off the ledge. A fuckin baby could do it.

And every time i think about this shit, his face flashes in front of my eyes. He's sobbing, his face is red from crying, his hair's a mess and he's begging me not to do it. And i must really love this man, because this is the first relationship i've ever felt secure enough to not cheat, not text other guys (haha, bpd problems) and i just can't do it to him.

So i think about other things. My social worker suggested in-hospital treatment before - but it's no phones allowed. I think i would go crazy if i couldn't talk to my boyfriend every day like i do now. So that's a no-go, i guess. I'm not on any meds.

I've worked in the education field since I got out of high school and can't seem to get a job that pays more that $10.50 an hour. I've been to over a dozen interviews since April. I knew there would be a pay difference, but not $6.50 difference. Also, the quality of the care that is provided to these children is awful and for how the job is already, I can't fathom dealing with neglect on top of it. 

Since we moved, I haven't been able to pay for my credit card bills so I'm having to file for bankruptcy whenever I can afford to. I have made too much already this year to qualify for a pro bono OR Medicaid even though I'm unemployed right now. I signed on with a temp agency for work back in July and haven't had consistent work since. Since July, I have also been searching for other jobs, including outside of my field.

I&amp;#39;ve been to over a dozen interviews since April. I knew there would be a pay difference, but not $6.50 difference. Also, the quality of the care that is provided to these children is awful and for how the job is already, I can&amp;#39;t fathom dealing with neglect on top of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we moved, I haven&amp;#39;t been able to pay for my credit card bills so I&amp;#39;m having to file for bankruptcy whenever I can afford to. I have made too much already this year to qualify for a pro bono OR Medicaid even though I&amp;#39;m unemployed right now. I signed on with a temp agency for work back in July and haven&amp;#39;t had consistent work since. Since July, I have also been searching for other jobs, including outside of my field.

I felt decently comfortable at this place and feel better right now. I’m still skeptical, I’m used to having really good things happen and then everything crash around me. I suppose I’ll see how things go. It’s not like the bridge within walking distance is going to *go* anywhere, it’ll be there when I need it...

I don’t even know where to start with this post, there’s so much in my head right now. I guess I’ll start with home. I live with my grandparents and my cousin, who my grandma adopted as a son 38/39 years ago. He has fetal alcohol syndrome. Because of that he has been allowed to get away with things any normal person would have been jailed for, such as hitting and being needlessly physical with a young child (ages 3-9 that I can remember). I can’t stand yelling because all it does is remind me of him screaming at me then beating me up. Nothing was ever done. I don’t know if he stopped at 9 because that’s when the family friend got caught being the pedophile that he is around me or what, but after age 9 o just remember my cousin becoming more verbally abusive than physical. It wasn’t any better. Between that and the family friend trying to fondle me, my depression started. 

I’ve been suicidal for a long time. Off and on throughout middle and high school, but over the past 3 years a lot has happened to make me think, “Man, life just isn’t worth it.” 

Funny thing is, I have a boyfriend that loves me. His family adores me. Can’t move in with any of them, sadly, or I would. Since I still have to live with my grandparents and cousin I still get to hear the verbal abuse every day and my grandma is such a pushover it’s no wonder my cousin almost unredeemable. She doesn’t even bat an eye when I remind her that he bullied a girl (not me) to nearly attempt suicide, tried to poison his supervisor by putting hand sanitizer in her drink (and he admitted he was trying to poison her), or that he tried to strangle one of our cats that had gotten sick... and then when I forced him out of the room the cat was in, he went and found a baseball bat *and intended to bash my head in*, but no. Nah, everything is fine. He’s not dangerous. He won’t be the cause of me killing myself.

You’d also think I’d be fine since I now have a job coach and a prospective job. I’m supposed to do a job trial tonight from 11pm to 1am. I should be excited, right? I’m not. I’ve had to take my grandparents and cousin to the doctor today, then I’m supposed to go with a friend later to get interview clothes. But I don’t really want to. I was supposed to see my therapist today, but I canceled that appointment. I don’t feel like I’m getting any real help from her, my psychiatrist, or my case manager anymore. It’s gotten to the point where there answer for everything is hospitalization, and I refuse to go through that hell again. Death is better than the mental wards around here. 

I’m tired of hearing, “You’ve got all this good stuff happening for you!” I know. And if I weren’t severely depressed, if I didn’t look at every bridge and wonder if it’s tall enough to kill me if I jump, if I felt like hanging in there would matter... but I don’t.

I don’t feel like living matters anymore. It feels silly now to have written what I did before when it really just boils down to I. Want. To. Die.

I don’t want the interviews, or the job trials, or $11/hour. Nor do I want my shitty $8/h job where they keep pushing me to do manager duties while not giving me a manager’s wage. I want to die.

I love my boyfriend. He’s great. Most of his family is great. If I weren’t so depressed, if I could be happy, I can tell we’d have a wonderful future. But we won’t, because I’m depressed. Because the major depressive disorder that’s stuck in my head is right: it’s better to die. 

I haven’t decided when I should do it yet. It’s less of a “if” now and more of “whenever I have the energy.” I’m so tired of basically having no days off. When I’m not at work I’m going to appointments or taking them to appointments or seeing family members in the hospital for one reason or another, and I’m just tired. I’m tired and no one will give me a break, and the only way I’m going to get a break is if I’m dead.

“That’s life,” my case manager said once. “You just do things because you have to.” Only she was referring to bowing to every whim my grandma has, because I spend 90% of my week either driving her somewhere or listening to how she doesn’t have any money, but somehow she has money for me to take her to all these places. If that’s “life” then life can fuck off and so can my apathetic case manager. 

I started self harming again. It’s becoming the only thing that keeps me from snapping. It’s tiding me over until I can jump. 

Sometimes fear shows up. What if I don’t die? What if I’m permanently cripple? I don’t know. I have no access to anything more lethal than jumping. I’ve got a TDO on record, so no way will they sell me a gun. I think jumping will work though. I wanted to try and stick it out but I don’t think I can anymore. Maybe after the job trial tonight. Won’t be a lot of people on the road at 1am. Grandma will be asleep and won’t even realize until the next morning that I didn’t come home. Cousin will only care because he won’t have anyone to bully anymore.

This post was originally meant for Aita, as the matter I wanted to discuss is suicide-related but more of a relationship problem. Unfortunately their rules don't allow to talk about suicide and redirect me here. I'll post it here as is, please forgive me for the formulation if it doesn't comply with the rules of this subReddit.

My cousin is two years younger than me, and we've always been close. I count as both friend and family to her, and that is the core of the problem, as she asked me as a friend to keep secret something that my aunt should know.

My cousin is a smart, cool, brave woman in her early thirties, and she has been diagnosed with a bunch of illnesses that make her life really hard. Basically, she is in constant pain in her eyes, and whenever she talks. We communicate either by text or throughout her boyfriend. Her illnesses are both chronic and rare, and the doctors are befuddled as to what exactly she is suffering from.

She has stopped working (she's an engineer) for three years, and is living between doctors appointments, in an appartement with closed shutters for photosensitivity, eating soup because of her jaw illness. France's healthcare is pretty good, but she still has some money problems with coping with the drugs necessary to alleviate and hopefully cure the symptoms of her diseases and the general cost of living in Paris, where are the specialists who follow her, and her circle of friends.

A few weeks ago, she dropped what I consider a bombshell on me. She told me that she is planning, in a few years (2 or 3), if her diseases don't improve, to undertake an assisted suicide medical procedure, probably in Belgium or in Switzerland, as it's apparently more legal there. She told me as a friend, part of a very restricted circle of people in the know and asked me to keep it secret.

Neither her mother (my aunt), nor mine, nor any other family member know about it. I am torn between keeping her faith in me (I have kept her secrets in the past, like the fact that she had a boyfriend), and telling my family what is obviously a life or death matter, even if the prospect is distant.

What makes it worse to me is that she won't ask for professional help : my first reflex was asking what her shrink thought about it, unfortunately she doesn't see her anymore since it really hurts for her to talk, and she already has to talk to many doctors and social workers and feels she doesn't have the spoons for the psy.

So, am I an asshole for not telling my family about this ? It will be her decision, at that time assisted by professional psychologist and psychiatrs, wether to peacefully end her life or not in the end, and I am agnostic on the matter for now, please don't debate assisted suicide in comments.

Sorry if my English is subpar, it is my second language. Also, this is my first ever post on Reddit, so I hope to find useful advice.

About four months ago I met two new people in my friend group. Let's call them girl A and girl B. Girl A had just become the girlfriend of a good friend of mine. When I met girl A, the same time I started getting a crush on girl B. These girls were best friends (as I've been told since a few months/weeks). Anyway, after two and a half weeks girl A got dumped and got single again. This was around the same time that I asked out girl B and she said yes. So one night I got into a text conversation with girl A and we just started talking about her breakup and my soon-to-be date. A friendship grew.

Eventually, I and girl B stopped dating and continued as friends. I would vent about my feelings about this to friend A and we became really good friends over the summer break. This was because I was on vacation and wasn't with friends so I wanted to text a lot with my friends back home and she because she didn't really have a lot to do. In the course of two weeks, we had sent over 14.000 texts to each other, talking about literally anything and everything.

But as I got back from vacation, I was surrounded by most of my friends again and I didn't feel the need to text every day and so much with girl A. She didn't like this as it turned out she had developed a crush on me too.

But at the same time, girl B wanted to date with me again and I said yes. This is where the drama started. I hadn't told girl A about this because I didn't want to tell a lot of people. But a few days after the conversation with girl B about starting to date again, I was gonna sleep over at girl A's house. There I eventually made the terrible and huge mistake to start kissing and we spent the night making out.

This was all my fault and I'd taken all responsibility for it and thus I told girl B about it and explained the situation to girl A. What followed would be drama that would take months.

Since both girls liked me, they became less good friends and eventually became two people who hang around in the same group of friends. Girl B had given me another chance for which I would ever be grateful but I took the decision to halt talking to girl A because I didn't trust myself. In this time I told the girl that I didn't want to talk to her. She spent nights writings letters of stuff that she wanted to say to me and tell me. Big things about her feelings and just things about her day.

But we started growing out of each other. She had always projected herself as a sad, maybe even a depressed person but I started getting annoyed by it because she really victimized herself while taking no action at all to better her life. Even though we all talked to her about this and gave advice.

We eventually got better friends again but I told her that I didn't want to talk about feelings and such as it would annoy me and make things bad. But she kept victimizing herself, didn't stop and yes I exploded. We got into fights and I said some horrible things. We tried afterwards to keep being friends but eventually, I came to the conclusion that it would be better if we didn't. I told her this many times but she just couldn't deal with it. She just kept hanging on the friendship that we had during the summer break. She would constantly swing from mood and act impulsively. She would delete and later on add me on SnapChat and stuff like that. At the one moment, she said she didn't want to see me and five minutes later she wanted to stay friends. I had to deal with this for weeks and eventually it really just got too much.

We tried everything to stop the drama but talking about it wouldn't work and I told her to just let it go and stop texting me. But she wouldn't stop. Over the weekend she has sent me over sixty texts (of which 50% being long paragraphs). Because talking about it had never worked in the past and only resulted in more problems, I decided to ignore the messages.  I opened the messages but wouldn't read most of them. In some of those texts so told me she hoped I would die and wished horrible things upon me and a few minutes later she told me that I was a great person. She sent links of sites that said ignoring someone is mentally torturing someone.

Eventually today she sent me some texts again (this was the third day of ignoring her). She said that she had almost killed herself the day before because of how things are between us. She claimed that she tried to kill herself before. She also claimed to be depressed but my friends and I know her, we know her problems and are convinced she isn't depressed. Her psychiatrist says she isn't depressed. But if she truly were depressed and tried to kill herself, she would be the third in our group who would've tried to kill themselves. One of those already succeeded.

Girl B has also been annoyed by the actions of girl A and has stopped being friends with her. We broke up again as we both agree we are better off as friends but we do have a strong friendship and both feel like girl A needs do change.

Now my problem is that I don't know what to do. I have tried talking to her before but nothing came out of it. I have tried ignoring her but now she claims to be suicidal. I feel like she's manipulative and victimizes herself a lot because she is addicted to getting attention. I don't want someone's coffin on my conscience but I don't want to keep going on with this drama. I suggested talking to her parents but my friends are convinced that won't help. All I know is that I don't need this on my conscience.

She has been emotionally draining to me and found ways to piss me off as no one has before. I don't believe she is mentally crazy but I am convinced that her thought process isn't right.

I'm not asking to be judged by previous actions taken by me or to be asked what's wrong with me. I just need help with this dramatically difficult situation.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m going to try to keep this as short as I can but I bet that this is going to be a large post as I think a lot of these &amp;#39;small&amp;#39; details are important for the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a very lucky life, my parents have decent jobs, we have a pretty good amount of money, my grades have been good for the most part. Overall I feel like my life is pretty alright. But for the past few months all that I’ve felt is emptiness. I feel like I have no reason to live. I had a very long lasting relationship with a girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, but she broke up with me in April and that has just added on to my emptiness, I can’t fucking get over her and it’s driving me crazy. And having pretty much no friends is icing on the cake

I just feel so empty and that I have no reason to live and I’m just sad all of the time, and I’ve been experiencing this for so damn long, I just want it to stop. I feel like killing myself is the only way because I’ve tried so many other things. I’ve tried talking to a therapist but it just made me very uncomfortable talking to someone about my problems face to face I hated it. I’ve tried a suicide hotline but they were just following a damn script. I feel like the only way to end my suffering is to just end my life.

But I can’t do it. I absolutely hate making people sad, and my mom is the sweetest person in the world and she loves me with all of her heart and I love her with all of mine. I don’t want to hurt her by ending my life, but it would just cause me to hurt instead. I feel selfish.

And this part is kinda stupid but it means a lot to me lol. Ever since I was a kid I have fucking absolutely loved Animal Crossing. If you don’t know what it is it’s a game aimed at kids where you live in a town with villagers that are animals and they really just feel like they care about you and that they are your friends. The newest addition of the game is coming out in March 20th and this is the only other thing that’s keeping me alive. I want to move into a new village with my animal friends while they talk about how lucky they are to be my friend :,)

My mom and animal crossing are the only two reasons I feel like I am alive right now. I’m definitely not going to kill myself until my mom is dead, but I’m just hoping that before my moms death something will make me want to live again.

I'm 20 years old. Nobody ever beat me when I was a child, nobody from my family ever treated me wrong to the point of no return, I did very well in school, etc. I'm not saying everything has always been amazing, because life's life and it has its ups and downs, obviously. But I've honestly had a pretty normal and ok life up to this point. I've had several medical issues but none of them extremely serious. Everything's great from a material stand-point, I have a job, I'm studying what I like (movie directing here in Argentina). I'm not a spoiled rich kid that wants to get attention, if you don't believe that's your problem I guess. I'm just being as honest as one can be to strangers on the Internet.

 Yet, I feel like I don't belong nowhere. I honestly feel homeless. I never ever want to go home, it's actually my last option of what to do in a day to day basis. Between work and classes, I don't spend much time at home anyways, but when I have a day off and can't find nothing to do, I can't stand being at home, which is supposed to be a place where I can feel comfortable. I hear a lot of people say ""Get out of your comfort zone to feel better"" and I just think, what is my comfort zone? 

For example, yesterday I went to the doctor and classes were cancelled so I was faced with the decision of either going home or finding something to do. I had no friends available (nor wanted to see them) and the girl I like was very busy so I didn't want to bother her. What did I do? Sit on the street, roll a joint, smoke some of it and just sat there alone until I felt like going home, which was obviously a lot earlier than usual. I had fun, because weed makes that when I'm alone, but it didn't feel right (not the smoking part, that is just ok i guess). This has been going on for almost a year, and it doesn't only happen when I smoke weed, so please don't give all the credit to it.

I'm not close to actually commiting suicide, and I feel """"""good"""""" to be able to say that. I know a lot of you folks are really really close or have tried, and I sincerely hope you all get better and can keep going. I know this sound a bit like humble-bragging, but I just felt like telling someone, and I hope some of you can understand. 

I feel like if no strings were attached, I'd rather not have to deal with these situations, basically meaning I'd love to not be here in this world right now. But I can't find enough justification to do it, nor do I want to hurt the people that, I believe, care about me. But in a way I think that if I feel like this is for a reason, and I'm tired of blaming myself for everything. Am I being selfish? I don't know, I just simply don't know what to think at this point.

Feel free to tell me if I did something wrong on this post, it's my first one here on this sub. I've just been a silent reader for a few months.

Hope you all have better, great lives and can keep going on despite all your struggles

But I can&amp;#39;t find enough justification to do it, nor do I want to hurt the people that, I believe, care about me. But in a way I think that if I feel like this is for a reason, and I&amp;#39;m tired of blaming myself for everything. Am I being selfish? I don&amp;#39;t know, I just simply don&amp;#39;t know what to think at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to tell me if I did something wrong on this post, it&amp;#39;s my first one here on this sub. I&amp;#39;ve just been a silent reader for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you all have better, great lives and can keep going on despite all your struggles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bye, thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;

she, while being rude and clearly annoyed the entire call, asked me why i even called, and i said i guess i was looking for at least one good reason not to kill myself tonight. when i explained further why each cookie cutter reason or solution she suggested was *provably* not true or helpful for me, she was audibly fed up with me and stopped even really talking to me other than to dance very closely around actually saying outright, ""well you might as well go ahead and kill yourself then if everything else has failed"". i can't remember her exact words but she essentially said that if everything she suggested already didn't work that there was nothing else i could do, so i said she was right, that my question was answered, and hung up 

which leaves me with 0 reasons 

please dont try and suggest any, i ***p r o m i s e*** you i've had plenty of time to ponder them in my 15 years of being suicidal (not an exaggeration. i'm in my 20s and its been a real shit life). i'm sick of people treating suicidal people like we're completely unable to think about things in any reasonable way. sometimes people are suicidal because their lives *actually do* suck, we're not just *delusional* and suffering from an ""inability to think clearly"". 

i'm not ""confused"" or ""blinded by depression"" and i might just knock the teeth down the throat of the next person to suggest that my wanting out of my shitty life that has only ever gotten progressively shittier *despite my absolute best efforts* is my own fucking failure. i can think *painfully* clearly about how literally every single person in my life, family or friends or significant others \[multiple, now exes, obviously\], has *in as many words* ***TOLD*** **me i'm a burden to them.** that any basic resources i consume like food, water, energy, and shelter, are wasted on me. that i make their lives worse and they wish i would never exist in their lives again. i can think *painfully* clearly about how ive contacted every single resource there fucking is for disabled people, abuse survivors, poor people, queer people, any combination of such or any other resource you can fucking imagine, and not only have none of them helped, but my life has continued to get worse and worse while every single person in my life blames me for every instance of abuse i've ever suffered, some of whom even go so far as to say that ""if I *won't CHANGE MY MIND about BEING DISABLED,* that I ""might as well go die in a hole"""". direct. quote. 

sometimes we HAVE tried everything and ""reaching out"" and ""just taking some time to think about things"" is not only what we've been trying our entire lives, but has made things multiply worse by doing so. im so sick of the standard response to ""i want to die because my life sucks"" being some variation of the comment ""then you just haven't tried hard enough to fix your life."" or even worse and more invalidating, ""well you're just being too negative, look on the bright side"". fucking trust me for eight goddamn seconds, trust that maybe, just *MAYBE,* I actually *HAVE TRIED* TO HAVE A LESS SHITTY LIFE, tried with ALL MY FUCKING POWER to fix anything that is anywhere near under my control. that just *maybe* I'm *not* just wallowing and refusing to help myself because I LIKE living this way. trust that I have only even made it this far BY focusing on the sparse positives and silver linings, and that I'm smart enough to find them if that's worked for a decade and a half already, even if only by the skin of my teeth. trust that if I say I'm running out of those good things, *maybe I actually fucking am.* maybe give me half an atom of credit that i might have EVER used my brain to try and help myself in some way or another, instead of insisting that everything that sucks about my life is somehow my fault for not being able to magically fix it or think of it as a positive, no matter how hard I GENUINELY HAVE tried to. dismissive, condescending infantilizing fucking cockholes.

i'm just out 

im out of reasons, im out of energy, im just 

a hollow husk 

im an amazing, talented, intelligent and deserving person, who loves bigger and harder than anyone I've ever known, that *anyone* should be so lucky to have in their life, but nobody can see that. nobody cares. all anyone sees is a weak, freeloading, burdensome piece of garbage, annoying them and wasting space that could be used by more deserving people and i'll never convince anyone otherwise

why waste my limited energy even trying anymore if doing so just makes me look like even more of a pathetic, hateable tryhard","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i dont even know why i tried. this is the first time out of my last four or five calls to them that i haven&amp;#39;t straight up been hung up on, but that&amp;#39;s how fucking desperate i was for a fucking reason to stay alive tonight. fucking pieces of shit, everyone at those horrible hotlines. i still stand by my stance that the only people they help are people whose lives are actually fine or at least only sucking averagely in totally fixable ways, but are just having a momentary breakdown that IS because of a mental illness making them not think straight. some of us aren&amp;#39;t so fucking lucky that our lives sucking and being unfixable IS all in our heads, and that we can be talked into seeing that again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she, while being rude and clearly annoyed the entire call, asked me why i even called, and i said i guess i was looking for at least one good reason not to kill myself tonight. when i explained further why each cookie cutter reason or solution she suggested was &lt;em&gt;provably&lt;/em&gt; not true or helpful for me, she was audibly fed up with me and stopped even really talking to me other than to dance very closely around actually saying outright, &amp;quot;well you might as well go ahead and kill yourself then if everything else has failed&amp;quot;. i can&amp;#39;t remember her exact words but she essentially said that if everything she suggested already didn&amp;#39;t work that there was nothing else i could do, so i said she was right, that my question was answered, and hung up &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which leaves me with 0 reasons &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;please dont try and suggest any, i &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;p r o m i s e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you i&amp;#39;ve had plenty of time to ponder them in my 15 years of being suicidal (not an exaggeration. i&amp;#39;m in my 20s and its been a real shit life). i&amp;#39;m sick of people treating suicidal people like we&amp;#39;re completely unable to think about things in any reasonable way. sometimes people are suicidal because their lives &lt;em&gt;actually do&lt;/em&gt; suck, we&amp;#39;re not just &lt;em&gt;delusional&lt;/em&gt; and suffering from an &amp;quot;inability to think clearly&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m not &amp;quot;confused&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;blinded by depression&amp;quot; and i might just knock the teeth down the throat of the next person to suggest that my wanting out of my shitty life that has only ever gotten progressively shittier &lt;em&gt;despite my absolute best efforts&lt;/em&gt; is my own fucking failure. i can think &lt;em&gt;painfully&lt;/em&gt; clearly about how literally every single person in my life, family or friends or significant others [multiple, now exes, obviously], has &lt;em&gt;in as many words&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TOLD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;me i&amp;#39;m a burden to them.&lt;/strong&gt; that any basic resources i consume like food, water, energy, and shelter, are wasted on me. that i make their lives worse and they wish i would never exist in their lives again. i can think &lt;em&gt;painfully&lt;/em&gt; clearly about how ive contacted every single resource there fucking is for disabled people, abuse survivors, poor people, queer people, any combination of such or any other resource you can fucking imagine, and not only have none of them helped, but my life has continued to get worse and worse while every single person in my life blames me for every instance of abuse i&amp;#39;ve ever suffered, some of whom even go so far as to say that &amp;quot;if I &lt;em&gt;won&amp;#39;t CHANGE MY MIND about BEING DISABLED,&lt;/em&gt; that I &amp;quot;might as well go die in a hole&amp;quot;&amp;quot;. direct. quote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sometimes we HAVE tried everything and &amp;quot;reaching out&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;just taking some time to think about things&amp;quot; is not only what we&amp;#39;ve been trying our entire lives, but has made things multiply worse by doing so. im so sick of the standard response to &amp;quot;i want to die because my life sucks&amp;quot; being some variation of the comment &amp;quot;then you just haven&amp;#39;t tried hard enough to fix your life.&amp;quot; or even worse and more invalidating, &amp;quot;well you&amp;#39;re just being too negative, look on the bright side&amp;quot;. fucking trust me for eight goddamn seconds, trust that maybe, just &lt;em&gt;MAYBE,&lt;/em&gt; I actually &lt;em&gt;HAVE TRIED&lt;/em&gt; TO HAVE A LESS SHITTY LIFE, tried with ALL MY FUCKING POWER to fix anything that is anywhere near under my control. that just &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just wallowing and refusing to help myself because I LIKE living this way. trust that I have only even made it this far BY focusing on the sparse positives and silver linings, and that I&amp;#39;m smart enough to find them if that&amp;#39;s worked for a decade and a half already, even if only by the skin of my teeth. trust that if I say I&amp;#39;m running out of those good things, &lt;em&gt;maybe I actually fucking am.&lt;/em&gt; maybe give me half an atom of credit that i might have EVER used my brain to try and help myself in some way or another, instead of insisting that everything that sucks about my life is somehow my fault for not being able to magically fix it or think of it as a positive, no matter how hard I GENUINELY HAVE tried to. dismissive, condescending infantilizing fucking cockholes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m just out &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im out of reasons, im out of energy, im just &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a hollow husk &lt;/p&gt;

As you may have guessed by the choice of subreddit, I am suicidal. Not currently actively seeking ways to die. But I have been recently, as recently as Friday evening.
I’m very lucky, I have a loving husband, two wonderful children (one is nearly an adult and the other is a bit younger, primary school aged). I even have friends. Two close friends who are lovely.
And family who try their best. My parents love us even though they don’t get things right all the time, and I have a loving sister and brother.

But my physical health is very bad. I have a condition that means eating causes pain and sickness. I have constant joint pain and constant nausea. I can barely eat anymore, what I can eat is very bland: no fibre, no fat and no meat (I don’t mind being vegan, but I can’t even eat vegetables or fruits). I have mild organ issues/observation checks with my heart, liver, kidneys etc. I struggle every moment of every day with unbearable symptoms.

I’m autistic, and I have PTSD and anxiety and depression (obviously).

I so don’t want to hurt anyone. But I don’t want to live in this pain and suffering anymore. Every time a doctor promises to try and help me with something, it doesn’t work and my health continues to get worse anyway. Or they don’t do it and I get forgotten again.

I’m in group psychotherapy, it’s been very helpful, but it’s limited. Nothing can fix my body. It just keeps getting worse.

The thing is, I want to be honest with everyone about how suicidal I am, especially group/the psychotherapists. But I am terrified their answer would be to lock me up in a mental health ward/hospital unit.

Taking me away from my children and husband would take away my only anchors. I would die. I couldn’t cope away from them. And my home is the only place in the world I can relax at all.

I was recently stuck in hospital for a couple of months because my digestive system tried to kill me again. It made me realise that I can’t cope away from my family and home. I would deteriorate to the point of no return. They are the only things that are important in this world to me.

I just don’t know how to tell them that taking me away is a death sentence. But leaving me here is risky too. I am too sick to seek help when it happens. And more worryingly my husband is having to work away for a weekend soon, and then a little longer. I will be alone at times. I’m so glad to get some space to be quiet, but also so anxious that being alone will make me get super stressed out or really really sick.

Any useful advice would be so gratefully received.

I’ve lived with suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. When I was 11 I used to try and suffocate myself. And steam burn my hands while making others tea. This isn’t new. I should never have been allowed to have children. That way I couldn’t hurt them.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,

I wanna fucking die. I can't do this.
I was having a rough ass day already because of my dysphoria and my doubts, plus I'm im the middle of a depressive episode.
I come home and I'm talking to my sister and she gets pissed because i tried to give her advice(not an asshole kind of advice, just school advice) and threw a tantrum by maling fun of my femininity, calling me a tranny faggot and yada yada yada. I went upstairs and even though i had been clean for months, i got in the shower and i just got the urge to cut. My mom just burst into the bathroom and saw me, and instead of trying to help she gaslit the shit out of me, saying ""how could you do this to me, do this again and I'll put you in an orphanage"" (how does that even work?) and acting like my pain is bad because it's an inconvenience for her. I seriously can't anymore. I wanna die. I'll never be a woman, I'll never be a n9rmal person, I'll never live in a normal family or a normal city, I'll never be not looked at as a freak. There's no point to life other than to spend money on therapists who won't solve anything because I'm broken beyond fixing. I just wish i could be a normal person. I juat wish i were a cis girl or even a cis boy instead of being this disappointment that i am. I'll never be loved and ill never love myself.

I'm deadass googling suicide methods to see which one is the fastest but i can't bring myaelf to do it. There's too many things holding me back. I don't wanna hurt anybody by putting an end to my own life. If i died spontaneously that'd be great, my family wouldn't have to understand why i did it or anything of that sort.

I know that they generally have to, but I've heard of people that self harmed and whose parents were not informed. (again, I live in Germany, so that's important as well) 

Some more info:
-I've tried to commit suicide before but currently I'm somewhat stable (meaning I wouldn't care if I die, but I won't do it myself) and I've got a contract with my therapist. She would lose her license to practice and possibly end up in jail if I die from suicide, which is reason enough for me to not do it.

-The reason why I don't want my parents to be alerted is because they would lose their shit. They wouldn't hurt me physically, but mentally. It happend before and they screamed at me, threatening to throw me out of the house and saying stuff about me ruining their lives etc. I'm currently trying to get out of there and live with a friend for some time (also supported by my therapist) and I have really bad relationship with all of my family members, so I really, really want to keep them out of it because they would just make it so much worse (also they think I'm better at the moment and I really don't want to ruin the illusion)

I finally believe my realizations and recollections are definitive.

I have autism (ASD) which for me mainly focusses around overthinking and obsessing. In obsessive periods I convince myself that I am something that I don't want to be, and drop everything I'm doing at that moment to force myself to think about things that prove whether I am a good or a bad person. I can't stop until I find ""that missing piece"" in my memory that makes the difference and can put my mind at ease. I have therapy for this. The past two months, this takes hours each day since I've been realizing I made a mistake in the past with regards to sex. I've come to realize that I acted horribly wrong.

My ex has borderline personality disorder. We were both 19 at the time, this happened 2 years ago. We were in a relationship for 6 months. My ex had sexual traumatic experiences due to past relationships, causing her to dissociate sometimes. This rarely happened during sex but the one time it happened before she would become motionless, experience flashbacks and would not be able to say stop. Our relationship was very bad. She was manipulative, blamed me for everything and we had fights all the time. She was afraid I would leave her/cheat on her if I didn't get enough sex from her and sometimes was angry at me because ""I would definitely cheat on her in the future"". Despite all this we also had our good moments and I (at the moment thought, at least, that I) loved her.

Let me explain the night of my mistake, where I try to explain my thought process at the time:

One night I hint that I'm into sex. She immediately asks me if I sometimes think about sex with other people. I'm a bad liar and I don't want to lie to anyone in the first place, so I'm honest and admit that I sometimes ""think"" about sex with others (as a sudden thought or during masturbation), but not with any intentions to act on it, I only want to have sex with my girlfriend. This turns into a fight where I try to reassure her of this.

When the fight calmed down, she asked me if I wanted sex. She still looked very bummed out and sad about the fight, so I figure she was not sincere and told her that I only want sex if she also wants to have sex and that I don't want her to initiate sex when she does not want to. I think she initiated because before the fight I told her I was in the mood, and suspected somewhere that the fight might have played a part in her decision. She tells me she wants too. I ask her a few more times if she was sure, because it didn't look like she was. Although unenthusiastically/reluctantly, she kept saying that she was sure. I wanted too, so I initiate foreplay but she told me that she did not want that, and told me to start right away with the deed itself. I remember that I had to slightly push her legs aside myself but I did not think much of that, since she initiated and told me she was sure. I ask her one more time if she is sure and she said something along the lines of ""just start already"".

I was still not convinced that she really wanted this, but my asshole brain thought it was not legally wrong to have sex with someone who initiates herself and tells you that she is sure. Also, it's her own choice and responsibility if she gives consent. I'm not proud of this mindset, but I also had a thought of: ""If you don't want this, you should have been honest or you have to tell me you don't want this when we start in a minute"". So we start. The sex was really bad: she was passive, unenthusiastic and barely moving at all. Because of this I thought about her maybe dissociating, but somehow I got some cues that made me think that she was not. I figured (during the sex) that instead she was just angry or sad about the fight and that she set that aside and wanted me to have sex with her to please me (since she initiated after the fight and said yes every time I asked if she was sure). The reason I thought that she was angry/sad because of the fight instead of dissociating was that she was passive and unenthusiastic from the very start, where she told me verbally that she was sure that she wanted sex. So she made the decision to have sex while she already knew herself that she didn't feel good. I told her that if there's something wrong she has to say so.

It gets worse: I have a memory of myself thinking/feeling during the sex about what I'm doing is wrong, maybe I even thought about rape, but proceeding anyway, driven by something I don't know. Emotion? Selfishness/libido? Blind obedience to her words? I really don't know what the exact thought was, but I know it gave me a malicious vibe. It felt like: ""What I'm doing right now is wrong/rape but I'll continue anyway"" or ""So this is how rape feels like. Might as well proceed because it's too late anyway"". Maybe I just shrugged it off as another intrusive thought. Maybe I could not take it seriously because I was just here, in my girlfriend's bedroom, having sex, something we've been doing a hundred times before. Maybe I was stubborn and decided to shut my brain down, with the thought about just following the unenthusiastic verbal consent my girlfriend gave me. I just didn't care anymore for some reason.

Now from here it's when it's becoming a mess in my brain when thinking back about it. I have ""memories"" about different scenarios that happened and thoughts that I could have had at the time, and I don't know which ones are real and what my exact thoughts were: I have a scenario in my head where I DID suspect she was dissociating but went on anyway, and a scenario where I disregarded the possibility of her dissociating and just thought she was just letting me have sex with her. The latter is something I've always convinced myself, but the past few days the first option has been popping up in my mind.

What I DO know is that I did indeed proceed. As far as I know that malicious thought described before went away pretty quick. I already figured there was something wrong, but I think I followed my reassuring thoughts I described before. I remember trying to undress her (she was just wearing her night gown) but stopping since she did not help. Again, did I think ""she does not want this so I'll stop"", or did I suspect her dissociating? I've always thought it was the first thought. Also, she did not return my kiss so I stop kissing her with the thought ""she is probably still mad at me"" and do not kiss her again. When I asked her something later (still during the sex) she verbally responded. Me even asking something in the first place would indicate that I already had in mind that she did not dissociate, right? Plus, she responded so at that point she was definitely not dissociating. I finish and when I gesture to finish her as well she tells me no, so we go to sleep.

The next day she told me that she did not feel comfortable about what I did last night. She then told me about her past trauma again. At the time I felt angry since I felt that she lied to me when she consented. Later that day she forgave me and I didn't think much of it after that. We broke up the day after that, since all the fights, blaming, manipulation that happened in the relationship got way to much for me, and now also the incident of 2 days before happened.

After the break-up she couldn't stop texting, calling and stalking me saying she wanted me back almost 24/7. The next moment she sent me e-mails cursing at me and calling me names, saying that she probably only had a relationship because she felt lonely and that kind of stuff. This was not a fun period. She even asks me to have sex with her just one more time and I declined and blocked her. (This and how to proceed after the break-up had been carefully decided along with my therapist, along with making sure she would not harm herself).

Now, 2 years later, looking back at it after all the #metoo debate and discussion about enthusiastic consent, I feel very guilty about that sexual experience. About two months ago it hit me. She might have been wrong by not being honest, but I was definitely wrong as well. I should have taken her passive behaviour during the sex as a sign to stop. I should have taken her irrational fear of me otherwise leaving her in consideration and make the moral choice based on that. I regret this all so much. I've never wanted to hurt her. How could I have went on with the thought ""she gave verbal consent, so it's not wrong to have sex"" instead of taking her body language in account? I saw things were wrong but I thought she set that aside to make the choice to initiate sex. How could I be so ****ing selfish? Because that's how I feel about it now, that I was an asshole. When in doubt or when verbal consent and body language contradict, just stop just in case, it's the moral thing to do. I take full responsibility for my actions that night. Since I realized this all two months ago, this keeps me up at night. It's the only thing I can think about now. I definitely learned from this, but I still can't forgive myself.

What bothers me the most is that one malicious ""rapey"" thought. I've never been inappropriate with girls, always made sure I had consent, never had ""rape fantasies"" and always rejected sex/lost my libido when I suspected my girlfriend was initiating while actually not wanting to. My girlfriend even told me multiple times I was acting too soft during sex and actually wanted me to be more forceful sometimes, but I did not like that idea. Why did I have that malicious thought and not care? Was I just tired of her BPD behaviour? Was I angry because I saw that she was not being honest? I guess I will never know. What I DO know is that I would never do this again.

How can I go on with my life knowing I had a sudden malicious thought during an already questionable act? I knew it was wrong and I didn't care. Do I even deserve forgiveness from society? I just can't live with the knowledge of having done this. The fact remains that I have taken advantage of someone sexually.

The only thing I can think of right now is killing myself. I can't concentrate on anything else or pretend like nothing happened. The thing is: I can't kill myself. My parents and sister are in a very bad situation because of their own mental health. This would ruin the lives. There are a few options:

- I kill myself, hurting my family
- I confess this to them, hurting my family
- I go to the police but won't get a case because legally this wouldn't be rape (we have a ""no means no"" policy here, not ""yes means yes"" yet)
- I apologize to my ex-gf, hurting her by coming back into her life again mentioning something sensitive
- I live on and suffer with this in secrecy, hurting my family because I can't function anymore

I can't win. And I deserve the suffering. I am in therapy but the idea that I've done something horrible like this can never go away. I just wish I would get killed or get an accident so I wouldn't have to make the decision myself.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve posted this story before, but in the meantime I&amp;#39;ve come to realize more things.

It felt like: &amp;quot;What I&amp;#39;m doing right now is wrong/rape but I&amp;#39;ll continue anyway&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;So this is how rape feels like. Might as well proceed because it&amp;#39;s too late anyway&amp;quot;. Maybe I just shrugged it off as another intrusive thought. Maybe I could not take it seriously because I was just here, in my girlfriend&amp;#39;s bedroom, having sex, something we&amp;#39;ve been doing a hundred times before. Maybe I was stubborn and decided to shut my brain down, with the thought about just following the unenthusiastic verbal consent my girlfriend gave me. I just didn&amp;#39;t care anymore for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now from here it&amp;#39;s when it&amp;#39;s becoming a mess in my brain when thinking back about it. I have &amp;quot;memories&amp;quot; about different scenarios that happened and thoughts that I could have had at the time, and I don&amp;#39;t know which ones are real and what my exact thoughts were: I have a scenario in my head where I DID suspect she was dissociating but went on anyway, and a scenario where I disregarded the possibility of her dissociating and just thought she was just letting me have sex with her. The latter is something I&amp;#39;ve always convinced myself, but the past few days the first option has been popping up in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I DO know is that I did indeed proceed. As far as I know that malicious thought described before went away pretty quick. I already figured there was something wrong, but I think I followed my reassuring thoughts I described before. I remember trying to undress her (she was just wearing her night gown) but stopping since she did not help. Again, did I think &amp;quot;she does not want this so I&amp;#39;ll stop&amp;quot;, or did I suspect her dissociating? I&amp;#39;ve always thought it was the first thought. Also, she did not return my kiss so I stop kissing her with the thought &amp;quot;she is probably still mad at me&amp;quot; and do not kiss her again. When I asked her something later (still during the sex) she verbally responded. Me even asking something in the first place would indicate that I already had in mind that she did not dissociate, right? Plus, she responded so at that point she was definitely not dissociating. I finish and when I gesture to finish her as well she tells me no, so we go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day she told me that she did not feel comfortable about what I did last night. She then told me about her past trauma again. At the time I felt angry since I felt that she lied to me when she consented. Later that day she forgave me and I didn&amp;#39;t think much of it after that. We broke up the day after that, since all the fights, blaming, manipulation that happened in the relationship got way to much for me, and now also the incident of 2 days before happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the break-up she couldn&amp;#39;t stop texting, calling and stalking me saying she wanted me back almost 24/7. The next moment she sent me e-mails cursing at me and calling me names, saying that she probably only had a relationship because she felt lonely and that kind of stuff. This was not a fun period. She even asks me to have sex with her just one more time and I declined and blocked her. (This and how to proceed after the break-up had been carefully decided along with my therapist, along with making sure she would not harm herself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, 2 years later, looking back at it after all the #metoo debate and discussion about enthusiastic consent, I feel very guilty about that sexual experience. About two months ago it hit me. She might have been wrong by not being honest, but I was definitely wrong as well. I should have taken her passive behaviour during the sex as a sign to stop. I should have taken her irrational fear of me otherwise leaving her in consideration and make the moral choice based on that. I regret this all so much. I&amp;#39;ve never wanted to hurt her. How could I have went on with the thought &amp;quot;she gave verbal consent, so it&amp;#39;s not wrong to have sex&amp;quot; instead of taking her body language in account? I saw things were wrong but I thought she set that aside to make the choice to initiate sex. How could I be so ****ing selfish? Because that&amp;#39;s how I feel about it now, that I was an asshole. When in doubt or when verbal consent and body language contradict, just stop just in case, it&amp;#39;s the moral thing to do. I take full responsibility for my actions that night. Since I realized this all two months ago, this keeps me up at night. It&amp;#39;s the only thing I can think about now. I definitely learned from this, but I still can&amp;#39;t forgive myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What bothers me the most is that one malicious &amp;quot;rapey&amp;quot; thought. I&amp;#39;ve never been inappropriate with girls, always made sure I had consent, never had &amp;quot;rape fantasies&amp;quot; and always rejected sex/lost my libido when I suspected my girlfriend was initiating while actually not wanting to. My girlfriend even told me multiple times I was acting too soft during sex and actually wanted me to be more forceful sometimes, but I did not like that idea. Why did I have that malicious thought and not care? Was I just tired of her BPD behaviour? Was I angry because I saw that she was not being honest? I guess I will never know. What I DO know is that I would never do this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I go on with my life knowing I had a sudden malicious thought during an already questionable act? I knew it was wrong and I didn&amp;#39;t care. Do I even deserve forgiveness from society? I just can&amp;#39;t live with the knowledge of having done this. The fact remains that I have taken advantage of someone sexually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I can think of right now is killing myself. I can&amp;#39;t concentrate on anything else or pretend like nothing happened. The thing is: I can&amp;#39;t kill myself. My parents and sister are in a very bad situation because of their own mental health. This would ruin the lives. There are a few options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I kill myself, hurting my family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I confess this to them, hurting my family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I go to the police but won&amp;#39;t get a case because legally this wouldn&amp;#39;t be rape (we have a &amp;quot;no means no&amp;quot; policy here, not &amp;quot;yes means yes&amp;quot; yet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I apologize to my ex-gf, hurting her by coming back into her life again mentioning something sensitive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I live on and suffer with this in secrecy, hurting my family because I can&amp;#39;t function anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t win. And I deserve the suffering. I am in therapy but the idea that I&amp;#39;ve done something horrible like this can never go away. I just wish I would get killed or get an accident so I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to make the decision myself.&lt;/p&gt;

There was a bit of a fallout between my best friend and I a couple months ago. We worked through it, but it left some open wounds on me that won't heal because of a traumatic past. My depression has progressively swallowed me into a pit, and every time I find a rock to step on and pull myself back out, I'm knocked in again. Only each time, it's deeper and it's a struggle to find my next rock.

My relationship with my mom has officially gone to shit. She's a main contributor to these feelings, but I can't get away due to legal obligations. I feel so alone anymore. I attempted suicide multiple times but I have yet to find something fool-proof. Maybe a noose? Not sure where I'd find a rope without it being obvious. Where I'd do it. If I want to scar the person who finds me for life.

No, I need something more discreet than that. It's 5:30 AM right now and I'm contemplating.

I act like I'm not just some robot who's on autopilot and generates emotions from a list that seems to get them the farthest without questions.

Yes, I am afraid of hurting them. And no, don't tell me that whole bullshit, ""think of them"". I don't care if I'm selfish right now. Don't throw that in my face. It makes me feel more guilty. They don't deserve a piece of shit like me in their lives in the first place.

Lately i have been struggling with anxiety and depression, which has lead to suicidal thoughts. To me, it seems like i'm only a burden and that i don't deserve to live.

I have an extensive support network consisting of teachers, friends and family members who have helped me in every way they can, and i'm so grateful for what they have done. But my personal life and responsibilities is still descending into chaos because of my depression and i'm so ashamed because of it.

I'm seventeen years old, male, and go to highschool. As most of you know, it can be a very stressful environment and frankly i feel overworked. I don't have many friends in school and the relationships i have feel superficial. 

I realize how privileged I am, I realize how much harder other people have had it. It may unexplainable, but i feel awful every single day and i dream of killing myself. 

I have been bullied in the past, nothing severe, but enough to make me sad and anxious. I was bullied for my long ugly hair and for my formal way of speaking. I still think about my bully every single day, and how he treated me.

Then i blocked her. i think she deserved it but thats just my opinion so whatever no one will believe me.

Well my online friend has lost a lot of ppl to suicide, including recently.. she freaked and threatened calling the police on me and stuff but said she didnt even know how they would find me and she got so mad at me. Then she said she had recently been broken up with and this was all too much and she was going to kill herself too. I didnt know what to do. i kinda just.. left it. Until the next day when i said i was sorry and i wasnt gonna do it. but i didnt hear from her. I texted the next day. finally she answered and it turns out she checked herself into the hospital and she said she hopes i go on living but she cant do this anymore and so she has to block me. 

The thing is, i didnt actually try killing myself.  i didnt even plan to. With my ex, i wanted to. i really did. And i really went out and drove to the railroad tracks. But i didnt stop or anything. idk why. i wish i could do it but i just couldnt and i knew it. Someone from reddit stayed on the phone with me until like 5am until i was in bed trying to save me.

My ex got around my block and texted me anyway about a month later, saying shes been trying to text me every day and to just let her know im okay. tonight i told her im alive. i didnt hear back.

When i told my online friend i was gonna die, i didnt even plan to do anything. idk why i told her. I didnt want help, or someone to care. once she cared and freaked out i felt so awkward and regretted telling her at all. I guess maybe i hoped tyring to create closure would make me feel more ready to leave this world finally. but it didnt work.

He had an affair with my current stepmom years ago. It was 1998 and I was 8 (little sister was 3) when he left and moved into an apartment, 9 when he moved 9,000 miles away from our hometown near Seattle all the way to Germany to live with my German stepmom (no, it’s not cool), and 10 when he married his affair. Due to my confusion and anger that he was replaced with a live-in nanny (read: someone who was not my dad) I set fire to some of the nanny’s personal belongings and had to enter children’s psychiatric hospital for a few months or weeks, can’t remember how long exactly. 

I’ve had relationship problems since I started dating in high school. My last three exes were toxic and manipulative and I’m finally actually single and happier that way. However I’m now facing my dad issues, finally. He and my stepmom had my half brother who is 15 years younger than me so idk how to relate to him. And he’s gotten all the attention I never got so I’m jealous. I do have aspergers which doesn’t help how I think about all of this. 

Over the years we’ve definitely had phone calls and been to Germany more times than I can count, and he’s visited us here. Recently instead of yelling at and blaming him for being such a shitty dad by moving 9,000 miles away for another woman, I actually opened up and explained that my black and white thinking is contributing to my point of view. This talk was at the beginning of a 5 day visit last September. The rest of his trip to see us was great, no problem. Normally I’d ghost him halfway through because it hurt too much to think about him leaving us again. This time I saw him every day for a few hours or more. The last day before he drove to the airport was ok but sad, then depression hit that night. Then the next night came and I was a fucking mess. 

I had been driving around all day and finally parked my car at my apartment. Thought about driving more but decided I better not because I didn’t feel so great emotionally. Suddenly I had a meltdown and pounded my fists on the steering wheel while screaming and sobbing. I felt hopeless and completely empty. My mom died in 2016 from a 13 year battle with thyroid cancer, and even that didn’t hurt like this did. I felt as if my dad ripped my heart out. I felt hollow, like there was nothing emotional for me to hold on to. Instead of driving anymore I went inside. After using the bathroom and drying my hands, I imagined hanging myself from the hand towel. Then I thought of using my x-acti knife used for origami to cut myself. Then I thought of getting drunk. Then I thought of overdosing on my anxiety/depression meds. At some point in these thoughts I also thought about calling the hospital on myself. Instead of doing any of these things I ate dinner and followed my usual bed time routine but took two extra meds to sleep. It took a week to start coming out of that dark hole of depression. 

I’ve told my therapists and those who know me best and are closest to me. My sister and I cried on the phone and in person. I’m getting a new psychiatrist soon so I can get a meds checkup (my old psychiatrist hasn’t been covered by my insurance for a few years and is now retired). I have a plan I made with my weekly therapist. 

My dad doesn’t know yet but I’m going to tell him how triggered I get when I feel abandoned by him. I have a long way to go to heal this lifelong wound (I’m 29) and I think telling him about these thoughts would help make room for healing. I also think he should know how much he affects me still. 

I still definitely get tempted to do stupid things like crash my car but I’m still here because of my sister. I couldn’t imagine leaving her with the pain of losing our mom and losing a sibling. She knows she’s the reason I’m still here and has said several times how grateful and lucky she is to have me as a sister and that I’m still in her life. She recently went through med school applications and I never doubted her for a second, and she said she doesn’t know how she would have gotten through it without me.

I compare myself to my sister because of how well she and our dad get along and because she doesn’t have a disability holding her back from anything. However I also compare myself to my stepmom because I mean, he left us for her. I asked if he moved to Germany to get away from mom or for our stepmom and he said “no, I moved there for her.” Stab me in the back again, why don’t you? Got enough scars, whats one more?

So yeah I’m telling him about my suicidal thoughts and getting help. My exes didn’t make me feel this shitty though, and I still cut them out of my life. My own dad makes me feel this way and I’m getting mixed opinions on what to do with him (hello, therapy). 

One more thing: in the past few weeks I also visualized hanging myself in my dads house to prove a point and so I’d stop feeling like shit. 

TL;DR my dads recent visit from 9,000 miles away in Germany to seeing us in the Seattle area went well but ended in me wanting to commit suicide because of triggered feelings of abandonment and hopelessness. Seeking help for it. 

Sleep well people.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m telling my dad I felt suicidal after his last visit when he left&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had an affair with my current stepmom years ago. It was 1998 and I was 8 (little sister was 3) when he left and moved into an apartment, 9 when he moved 9,000 miles away from our hometown near Seattle all the way to Germany to live with my German stepmom (no, it’s not cool), and 10 when he married his affair. Due to my confusion and anger that he was replaced with a live-in nanny (read: someone who was not my dad) I set fire to some of the nanny’s personal belongings and had to enter children’s psychiatric hospital for a few months or weeks, can’t remember how long exactly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had relationship problems since I started dating in high school. My last three exes were toxic and manipulative and I’m finally actually single and happier that way. However I’m now facing my dad issues, finally. He and my stepmom had my half brother who is 15 years younger than me so idk how to relate to him. And he’s gotten all the attention I never got so I’m jealous. I do have aspergers which doesn’t help how I think about all of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years we’ve definitely had phone calls and been to Germany more times than I can count, and he’s visited us here. Recently instead of yelling at and blaming him for being such a shitty dad by moving 9,000 miles away for another woman, I actually opened up and explained that my black and white thinking is contributing to my point of view. This talk was at the beginning of a 5 day visit last September. The rest of his trip to see us was great, no problem. Normally I’d ghost him halfway through because it hurt too much to think about him leaving us again. This time I saw him every day for a few hours or more. The last day before he drove to the airport was ok but sad, then depression hit that night. Then the next night came and I was a fucking mess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been driving around all day and finally parked my car at my apartment. Thought about driving more but decided I better not because I didn’t feel so great emotionally. Suddenly I had a meltdown and pounded my fists on the steering wheel while screaming and sobbing. I felt hopeless and completely empty. My mom died in 2016 from a 13 year battle with thyroid cancer, and even that didn’t hurt like this did. I felt as if my dad ripped my heart out. I felt hollow, like there was nothing emotional for me to hold on to. Instead of driving anymore I went inside. After using the bathroom and drying my hands, I imagined hanging myself from the hand towel. Then I thought of using my x-acti knife used for origami to cut myself. Then I thought of getting drunk. Then I thought of overdosing on my anxiety/depression meds. At some point in these thoughts I also thought about calling the hospital on myself. Instead of doing any of these things I ate dinner and followed my usual bed time routine but took two extra meds to sleep. It took a week to start coming out of that dark hole of depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve told my therapists and those who know me best and are closest to me. My sister and I cried on the phone and in person. I’m getting a new psychiatrist soon so I can get a meds checkup (my old psychiatrist hasn’t been covered by my insurance for a few years and is now retired). I have a plan I made with my weekly therapist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad doesn’t know yet but I’m going to tell him how triggered I get when I feel abandoned by him. I have a long way to go to heal this lifelong wound (I’m 29) and I think telling him about these thoughts would help make room for healing. I also think he should know how much he affects me still. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still definitely get tempted to do stupid things like crash my car but I’m still here because of my sister.

I got in my car around 8pm and started driving with no place in mind. I drove for almost an hour across the Montana state line and found a lookout over a cliff, it was so dark but with my car lights on and the water beneath it, it felt beautiful. I sat there on my hood for what felt like hours, I screamed, I cried, and I spoke into the atmosphere of questions and things I didn’t know I had felt up until than. I realized something horrible and dark in all that beauty. When I asked what I should do, why do I feel like this, what comes next, I got nothing. Absolutely nothing. I’ve never been religious but today was really the day I realized there was no god or gods, there are just people and earth. We are all on this rock in space and are completely and utterly alone. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is me, and the only thing keeping me alive is me. There’s never been anything else. I’m home now, alone, still feeling vulnerable and empty, but now it feels I don’t know, maybe calmer? I know I definitely still need to get help, and maybe even check myself in to a hospital, but I think I have an entirely new perspective on death and suicide. I’ve tried so many times in the past, my whole teen years were spent swallowing pills and cutting myself, it was all so chaotic and desperate. It’s different now but I’m still scared. I wonder if I’ll ever stop feeling this way. I could have done it. It could have been today, and it could be tomorrow for all I know. I just know one day I’ll go through with it, to end these horrible feelings, but now I accept it. I accept it fully.&lt;/p&gt;

My girlfriend has had a really rough life, and because of it she’s developed some bad depression and shes already got some issues with social anxiety and other mental issues.

Since I met her it’s been fine, she’s been happy when spending time with me and everything.


Recently it’s gotten bad though, she started cutting herself and drinking her feelings away. She told me that she wants to kill herself so she doesnt feel the way she does anymore.

I’ve spent lots of time consoling her and trying to have her get help or take small steps to help her not feel that way but with all the advice I give her and options that she can pursue she’s done none of them. 

It’s been a week since we had a talk from 10pm to 5am because she texted me she needed to talk to me. She was almost blackout drunk and told me that she’s realized shes an alcoholic and wants to change, she told me about how bad she felt and how she wanted to stop feeling that way so she chose to drink. She then told me she wanted to be alone and I knew better to leave and asked her if I could just stay and we didnt have to talk and then she confessed she was going to kill herself after I had left. So I talked to her about how that shouldnt be an option and how she can get out of the depression shes in and how theres so many people that are willing to help support her on this path. She agreed to everything and said she’d start trying to do better and not drink or cut herself.

It’s been two days and I just caught her drunk and with new cuts. I previously told her that if she ever felt this way to call me and I would be able to talk to her to help her feel better. It kinda feels like a punch in the face that she didnt do that. And it kinda screams to me that she doesnt want to try at all to get better. All of this happening and shes been acting like shes been fine to her mom who talks to her semi regularly.

Shes been in and out of psychiatrists with no help because I feel like she doesnt want help. Now because of her past she refused to see someone or take medicine to try and help.

I decided that today this has become out of my control and I gave my gf a ultimatum that she needs to tell her mom about whats going on to try to get help and if she didnt, I would tell her mom. AITA for not letting her choose when to tell her mom, if at all? I just care about her so much and it hurts to see her do this to herself and not try to get better. All she does now is push me away and not tell me anything so I felt like I absolutely needed to do this.

Tl:dr my girlfriend has been in a bad depression and tried to kill herself and talks about how that would be such an easy way to not feel the way she does anymore, so I told her to tell her mom about whats been going on or I would.



On the off chance this gets popular, please dont let it happen. I really dont want her to see this on the front page of reddit or anything because my gf occasionally will use reddit on her phone.

Forgive my formatting I am on mobile. So might as well jump into it. 

I will begin with my brother and my relationship. My brother is 4 years older than me and he always looked out for me in more ways than I will ever know and ways I am finding out from his friends he loved me more than I ever knew and probably more than I know now. My parents have always argued for as long as I can remember since before I was in preschool and my brother would do his best to shield it from me and he would shield me from my parents toxic parenting habits by taking their positive traits and enforcing those on me acting as third parents in my life essentially.  We also were friends growing up constantly playing with neighborhood kids and just spending time together and just teaching me things and letting me experience life on my own at the same time. He would always be there for me no matter what and always understand my thought processes given how weird and different they are but he would understand my true intent and he was honestly the only person who could do that. As we grew older into our teens we got a little more distant him gaining high school friends and being more social while me struggling through middle school but he still cared for me the same we then grew up more his twenties and my late teens. Our level of maturity was finally equalizing and I was realizing why he did things the way he did when he was my age and slowly comprehending his thought processes bringing us even closer. When I was a younger teen he brought me to hang out with his friends who took a liking to me and bringing us back to current day his friends happened to be my friends and we would all hang out and just do things together and me and my brother were friends in the group who happened to be brothers and I never would invite myself to things if they wanted me there they would let me know and they did a lot that’s how I knew they were friends with me because they would hang out with me even while my brother was busy doing other things and I was available. Of course there is the brother bond that we had, for us that was being each others other half mentally he would be a very logical thinker meanwhile I would be very logical but emotionally charged as well and I had a lot less common sense than he did and we just had a dynamic that was easy for people who met us together for a half hour would be able to see the level of closeness we had. 

I would keep rambling on about how close we were but this post is gonna be long don’t need to make it any longer so now let’s go into background of my brothers past and what my parents would not let him live down.

When my brother was a young teen he finally started to think for himself and be able to argue things and he was good at it. My parents did not like that especially my father who when my brother was a young teen throttled him into a wall. A throughout the years my brothers relationship with my parents after that degraded more and more emotionally and physically. When my brother had finally graduated high school he started dating his first love who eventually broke his heart after that he had been smoking weed and he started doing acid and other harder drugs I still don’t even know about. My parents eventually found this when he upgraded his phone and went through his old phone and saw the messages(rookie mistake to keep the messages). And my parents just started verbally abusing my brother even more because he was depressed and failing school blowing through his college fund and using his job money to barely pay his car insurance and the rest for drugs and food. Eventually though my brother turned his life around and started doing much better for himself. He got a full time job being decently paid for someone his age without a bachelors. He was going to school on the side paying for everything and never asking for money. He was a straight A student everyone at his job loved him and new him as a real guy who meant what he was saying and did good and put a 120% into everything he did. He has a dog that they got him as a Christmas present two years ago and he wanted to train the dog to be a well trained dog he would pay for sessions try himself and do other things to make him a well behaved dog, but my mother wouldn’t follow the training at all completely derailing all the effort my brother put in and hurting him deeply because he was still depressed and struggling through life trying to find happiness and his only reason to live was that dog. 

Now getting into the day before he decided to do it. 

I was in my room working on an assignment eating my favorite candy which is also his he asked for one and I gave it to him then he swiped the bag from me so we started running around the house both holding onto the bag him trying to pull it away and me trying to get it back. The dog could not decipher the difference between play and threat and bit but this wasn’t like the other times he had done this he had broken skin and gone a bit deep and made my brother bleed. So my brother started reprimanding the dog as that is 100% not ok to do because if he did that to some stranger he would be put down in our jurisdiction at least. My mom hearing the commotion came out of her room and asked what was happening he explained and she started yelling at my brother for “abusing” the dog. Which started a heated argument and at this point I had my candy and had to finish this assignment bc it was due at midnight it was 9 so I did not know how long it would take so I went back to working on it. I finished the assignment about 45 minutes later. They were still arguing and at the beginning of the argument my dad had been on his side now the argument had turned to mainly my dad and my brother arguing and my father started verbally attacking my brother with some bullshit claims so I joined the argument defending my brother which my dad then started targeting me but at a young age my dad taught me the bad habit of how to immediately cut a person down at their core and verbally destroy them and me and my brother do not share many details of our personal life to them but we know many things about them so we can completely stop our parents in our track because my dad was trying to do this to us. So me and my brother started tag teaming my dad destroying him VERBALLY (Pervs) and my dad couldn’t argue with us anymore so he got physical pushing my brother out of the room( my brother is older than me but is slightly shorter and a lot skinner I am a few inches taller and a lot more heavy set) he then tried to the same to me and my brother immediately said if you put your hands on him it’ll be the last thing you do so my dad threw what I can only describe as the girliest punch ever at my brother and after that we realized he put hands on both of us( or at least tried to me) so I went to call 911 and my mother the maniac she is said that she would tell the police we hit him and that she would put us in jail so we decided it would not be worth it to make the call and kept arguing. The law system is fucked around here so we would be the ones fucked and he would get off Scott free. So then my dad lock their door and at this point my brother is sick of not being able to train his dog and wants to give it away and then move out. So he argues with them to give them his dog so he can put it in a better home away from them and him so he can be a happy dog. He sits at their door arguing for about an hour as I occasionally chime in. Eventually he gives up and comes into my room saying he is done and out of motivation and he has lost his only reason to live and was genuinely done with life. I pleaded and cried at his beside for 2 hours while he just sat there emotionless saying he would do it in two days, he would take the next day off of work find a place to adopt his dog then give me his last paycheck and ticket to a musical festival he was going to then off himself I eventually couldn’t find anything else to plead with and had given up and was trying to think of friends to talk to before just shoving him in a hospital.

Now comes the day in my life I will never forget and never be able to stop feeling the pain from.( Btw I love you and thank you for reading through my ramblings of a broken teen and sorry for all the grammar errors English is not my strong suit it was his, mine is math his wasn’t, like I said two halves of a whole).

My brother wakes me up having gotten his dog out to the room and being dressed for work and telling me “Hey dads coming home in a half hour make sure he doesn’t do anything stupid and watch blue and text me with updates I’m going to work later” So I wake up tired and slightly confused but processed and started looking around went to the garage my brother had already left for work, and I saw my dad with locks he was planning on changing all the locks in the house to kick us out. I went to my mom who was in her bed and she said to me your dad wants you and your brother out and I said why( me and my brother were now not leaving out of spite). And said because you guys attacked him last night and I just made her relive the moment of what she was referring to making her realize me and my brother literally stood there with out arms crossed doing nothing my dad was the one attacking us and it clicked for her. My parents both went to work and I later in the day went to class and attend college where my mom works I stopped in her office in hopes she wasn’t there to grab a water out of her mini fridge and she was there with a co worker and asked if I wanted to have lunch later, not wanting to air family drama at her place of work I said maybe depends on what I’m doing after class. I texted my brother he said do it and take the small wins we can get because if we can get mom on our side we can fuck over dad (at this point we didn’t really care about what my mom had said we were livid at our father). I get lunch with my mother and I am able to sway her to he on our side more and then go home to keep watch of the house because we were still uncertain if my dad were going to try anything. Eventually my mom comes home later and tells me that she told my dad not to kick us out and something else I cannot remember. I tell my brother and he says alright good and informs me at the end of the month we’re gonna pack all our shit up in a hurry and dip the fuck out and move in with his best friend I say ok and that I’m going to spend time with my (now ex) girlfriend so I go spend time with her and come home and my brother is there and we begin to discuss things and then our dogs( I have one to but his is the main one in this story) start barking because it’s around then time we usually walk them. So he says let’s talk about it while we walk the dogs and I say why not go the dog park he says he wants to walk so I agree. We begin the walk and are talking and he seems to be in a better mind state and we are talking about the future so I am a lot less concerned about him killing himself, 

We begin to cross the street to a park we would go to, to let our dogs run around and play and as we’re almost across the street my brother let’s go of his dogs leash and stops and I look and see a car coming he stands in the lane it is in with his arms spread( t posing basically) and I say his name trying to get him to keep moving not realizing what he was doing the car then swerved to miss him and then jumped in front of it and went flying. He hit the asphalt and at the moment I knew my brother was dead. He did not leave a note, he didn’t say anything to me, and he didn’t make a sound. I only heard him get hit by the car and a few seconds later land on the asphalt. Seeing what I did in that moment my brothers soul flew out his body I’m sure of it. 

Now comes my question I’m still in shock over this and I am trying to come to terms with this and deal with it but it’s not a thing many people or anyone I have met or the research of done on google have been through so honestly I’m just struggling I know there isn’t a right way to grieve but I just want help. I do have suicidal thoughts but they are not serious ones they’re passing ones that fade quickly I just don’t know has anyone experienced this horrible thing. I know it’s fucked but if you could just share with me it would help immensely losing him was literally getting a half of myself torn off. Thank you for reading I know this basically of novel filled with bad grammar and ramblings but I felt like all the details I have included are the important I stopped myself from extending this a lot more. Again thank you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello reddit this is my first post on reddit and right now I’m slowly comprehending my brothers suicide and was maybe seeing if anyway has experienced something as horrible as I have. Forgive my formatting I am on mobile. So might as well jump into it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will begin with my brother and my relationship. My brother is 4 years older than me and he always looked out for me in more ways than I will ever know and ways I am finding out from his friends he loved me more than I ever knew and probably more than I know now. My parents have always argued for as long as I can remember since before I was in preschool and my brother would do his best to shield it from me and he would shield me from my parents toxic parenting habits by taking their positive traits and enforcing those on me acting as third parents in my life essentially.  We also were friends growing up constantly playing with neighborhood kids and just spending time together and just teaching me things and letting me experience life on my own at the same time. He would always be there for me no matter what and always understand my thought processes given how weird and different they are but he would understand my true intent and he was honestly the only person who could do that. As we grew older into our teens we got a little more distant him gaining high school friends and being more social while me struggling through middle school but he still cared for me the same we then grew up more his twenties and my late teens. Our level of maturity was finally equalizing and I was realizing why he did things the way he did when he was my age and slowly comprehending his thought processes bringing us even closer. When I was a younger teen he brought me to hang out with his friends who took a liking to me and bringing us back to current day his friends happened to be my friends and we would all hang out and just do things together and me and my brother were friends in the group who happened to be brothers and I never would invite myself to things if they wanted me there they would let me know and they did a lot that’s how I knew they were friends with me because they would hang out with me even while my brother was busy doing other things and I was available. Of course there is the brother bond that we had, for us that was being each others other half mentally he would be a very logical thinker meanwhile I would be very logical but emotionally charged as well and I had a lot less common sense than he did and we just had a dynamic that was easy for people who met us together for a half hour would be able to see the level of closeness we had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would keep rambling on about how close we were but this post is gonna be long don’t need to make it any longer so now let’s go into background of my brothers past and what my parents would not let him live down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my brother was a young teen he finally started to think for himself and be able to argue things and he was good at it. My parents did not like that especially my father who when my brother was a young teen throttled him into a wall. A throughout the years my brothers relationship with my parents after that degraded more and more emotionally and physically. When my brother had finally graduated high school he started dating his first love who eventually broke his heart after that he had been smoking weed and he started doing acid and other harder drugs I still don’t even know about. My parents eventually found this when he upgraded his phone and went through his old phone and saw the messages(rookie mistake to keep the messages). And my parents just started verbally abusing my brother even more because he was depressed and failing school blowing through his college fund and using his job money to barely pay his car insurance and the rest for drugs and food. Eventually though my brother turned his life around and started doing much better for himself. He got a full time job being decently paid for someone his age without a bachelors. He was going to school on the side paying for everything and never asking for money. He was a straight A student everyone at his job loved him and new him as a real guy who meant what he was saying and did good and put a 120% into everything he did. He has a dog that they got him as a Christmas present two years ago and he wanted to train the dog to be a well trained dog he would pay for sessions try himself and do other things to make him a well behaved dog, but my mother wouldn’t follow the training at all completely derailing all the effort my brother put in and hurting him deeply because he was still depressed and struggling through life trying to find happiness and his only reason to live was that dog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now getting into the day before he decided to do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in my room working on an assignment eating my favorite candy which is also his he asked for one and I gave it to him then he swiped the bag from me so we started running around the house both holding onto the bag him trying to pull it away and me trying to get it back. The dog could not decipher the difference between play and threat and bit but this wasn’t like the other times he had done this he had broken skin and gone a bit deep and made my brother bleed. So my brother started reprimanding the dog as that is 100% not ok to do because if he did that to some stranger he would be put down in our jurisdiction at least. My mom hearing the commotion came out of her room and asked what was happening he explained and she started yelling at my brother for “abusing” the dog. Which started a heated argument and at this point I had my candy and had to finish this assignment bc it was due at midnight it was 9 so I did not know how long it would take so I went back to working on it. I finished the assignment about 45 minutes later. They were still arguing and at the beginning of the argument my dad had been on his side now the argument had turned to mainly my dad and my brother arguing and my father started verbally attacking my brother with some bullshit claims so I joined the argument defending my brother which my dad then started targeting me but at a young age my dad taught me the bad habit of how to immediately cut a person down at their core and verbally destroy them and me and my brother do not share many details of our personal life to them but we know many things about them so we can completely stop our parents in our track because my dad was trying to do this to us. So me and my brother started tag teaming my dad destroying him VERBALLY (Pervs) and my dad couldn’t argue with us anymore so he got physical pushing my brother out of the room( my brother is older than me but is slightly shorter and a lot skinner I am a few inches taller and a lot more heavy set) he then tried to the same to me and my brother immediately said if you put your hands on him it’ll be the last thing you do so my dad threw what I can only describe as the girliest punch ever at my brother and after that we realized he put hands on both of us( or at least tried to me) so I went to call 911 and my mother the maniac she is said that she would tell the police we hit him and that she would put us in jail so we decided it would not be worth it to make the call and kept arguing. The law system is fucked around here so we would be the ones fucked and he would get off Scott free. So then my dad lock their door and at this point my brother is sick of not being able to train his dog and wants to give it away and then move out.

I'm in the midst of potentially receiving diagnosis for ADD and depression but like my dad I am probably very hard to diagnose because I'm pretty smart and not a problem maker I'm sorry if that makes me sound like a braggart and I hope something of use is at least gleaned from the results because I can't ""fix"" myself anymore and the feeling of worthlessness, lethargy, and deep unknown sadness is getting more frequent and stronger as the weeks go on.

I've told myself ""your parents will get over it"" and ""just do it, not like you were worth much anyways"", it's weird, I pace around and talk to myself like a madman, like some sort of psychic split has occurred and I'm waging war with the worst of myself and I lose ground every day.

Part of me believes that I shouldn't complain about these problems that ""there are so many people that need more help than you do, stop complaining"", I find it difficult to voice my problems hence I'm here where no one will know me. I had a good childhood with loving parents who argued very little and an amazing, ambitious, and wonderful younger sister all of whom I love to no end. so why should I be feeling this way? what kind of messed up self pity am I voicing here? and why should anyone care If I die, they'll get over it and be stronger in the end, I would have done my job making the world a better place by leaving it. I didn't even graduate high school with any practical hobbies or skills so what could I have added to the world anyways by living?

I'm sorry for the rant-like post I am going through the motions, heck I'm pretty sure few will see this or care but perhaps it is one of the few ways I can stay sane till I can get some help, in some sort of subconscious last ditch effort before going under by whatever last remnants of my will moved me to type this. I apologize for my hellish grammar in advance, never really got better at that.

TL:DR (if that even applies in this subreddit) I suffer in silence, I'm failing to actualize myself, Thought of offing myself, Potentially have ADD, shouldn't have a reason to complain, I'm losing ground in the war against myself, and I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN FEAR AND HATRED OF MYSELF AND LIFE ANYMORE!!!

I don’t want to be found. It’s been a long road coming and lately I’ve gotten a lot off my chest.

I finally told my family what happened to me as a kid. I came clean about a lot of the things I went through and knew. 
I was terrified of dying because I was so scared of anyone finding out after I was gone and not being around for the reaction.
I’m not scared anymore. 
I feel so free. 
I feel so ready.
I just wanted to say thanks for all the support I’ve gotten on here with previous accounts. Thanks for always listening. 
My story is finally coming to a close.
It feels so peaceful.

I’ve got everything set in motion, and I’ve started the process. My notes are out.

I don't know how many posts i've made on different subreddits about my mom. I know she's gone through a lot in her life but I don't see why she feels the need to take it out on us! She's not abusive but I sometimes wish she was. The emotional abuse is way worse. It used to be that we didn't talk for a couple of years because we kept getting into arguments but we've made up recently. I still despise her for what she's done to me but i've forgiven her. I've learned that from now on, if we get into arguments, its best to just apologize and take all the hurtful things she says and just move on. It seems so simple but I always end up angry and crying all alone even after I put up a brave face in front of her. I never cry but lately I feel like i've just broke and all the strength I used to have is just leaving me. All the hope. 

Today we got into another argument. My mom messes up our house A LOT. In her eyes she sees it as saving money and whatever but in my my eyes (and my siblings) its just clothes stuffed in every closet and scattered around the house. Pans and dishes stacked in the sink. Tons of food stuffed in thr fridge and freezer. The floor is sticky all the time. The bathrooms are oily from her many ""at home"" skin remedies and we have cockroaches and all sorts of bugs. Even though all of this is HER mess, whenever she comes home (with more unnecessary stuff) she blames us for the mess. Then she gets really angry and hits my younger sister's and screams at all of us to clean ""our"" mess. When we finally have the courage to tell her its her mess, she comes back with, ""I've been cleaning up your mess all my life and now its time for you to take part in the house"". 

Last week, my sister and I cleaned up our whole house and made it spotless. As soon as my mom comes home, we tell her not to make a mess anymore and if she does, to clean it up. She laughs and says that she will. But everyday I come home, there's more and more mess that I have to clean AGAIN. Today I asked her to clean go the mess in the kitchen since she made it. She goes off and says ""What mess did I make? I don't need a kid to tell me how to handle my house! Instead of insulting your mom, why don't you do something useful! Do you think you cleaned the house because you wiped a few cabinets and threw away a few things!""  BTW, the ""things"" we thre away were dishes and spoons that my mom put powder bleach on and left in the dishwasher for 4 MONTHS. I just thought it wasn't good to eat from that. And my sister threw away meat and oil that was sitting in the freezer for YEARS. 

Anyways, I tried to explain that the only reason I was being strict is because she always complains when the house is messy and we finally cleaned it so wouldn't it be nice to have it this way. Also, instead of stacking up messes and then worrting when the manager calls for an inspection, wouldn't it be nice to not have to pull an all nighter to clean. Plus, we spent 2 days cleaning the house by ourselves and I bought new dishes and silverware so wouldn't it be nice just to take care of the things your kids give you. But NO. Instead, I was yelled at for being a mean daughter who didn't care about her mother's feelings. How dare I insult her in her own home. 

As usual, I apologized. My mom keeps hurling insults. I apologize. Again and again and again until my hands are shaking from rage and my throat is hurting from the ball of tears i'm holding back. Again and again until it finally slows down a little bit. I apologize one last time and I head out. I'm sitting in my car right now. Crying. Angry. And I wish that I could just take this car and crash it. Crash it so bad that there's a lot of damage done to me but not enough to kill me or injur me permanently. Just enough to hopefully realize that maybe one day she'll loose me and maybe be nice to me. Is it too much to ask. To just not be yelled at for anything and everything. To be thanked and appreciated. 

The only thing stopping me from doing it is the fact that I KNOW she won't care. Isn't that funny. She'll care about acting worried in front of the neighbors. She'll care about looking so motherly when she rushes into the emergency room and demands to see me. She'll care about all the ""negative"" attention she's getting because her daughter wanted to ""kill herself"". She'll only care about herself and how she's the victim in this situation. Funny right. 

I know some of you guys might think that I'm over reacting. After all, how can a mother think that way. ""I know she cares about you"", you'll say. Trust me, i've been hoping that was true since as long ad I can remember. Maybe I'm just not seeing it through her eyes, I thought. But that's just the truth. When I'm at hone she's calling me all sort of names but as soon as we step one foot out the door, all of a sudden I'm her little angel. 

I can't bottle up all this anger anymore. I wish I can but I can feel it about to burst any second. I don't want to do something stupid.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post...I tend to feel a little better aftet I get it all out..&lt;/p&gt;

I have nothing to go back to, I now have nothing here. I want to walk down to the nearest lake and swim out right now. At least I wouldn’t have to wake up tomorrow with no fucking clue where to go from here. I don’t know what to do I just want it all to end.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m afraid of falling and regretting my decision on the way down but I don’t have any guns and I don’t want to buy any either, so I think jumping might be the best. I don’t want any chances of regretting it past the point of no return. 

Here it is, 


When I was a small child I had thought that the universe solely existed as a torture dungeon specifically designed to cause universal suffering. I thought that I existed solely for pain. This plagued me up until about 3 years ago, or maybe even 2. Perhaps even 1. It’s hard to say because my mind has gradually changed over time since I’ve made significant lifestyle changes, something I’ve had to do probably 3 times with much more to come. 

There was always this feint feeling of hope inside of me, the hope and the desire to change and seek out the life I want to live to become the best version of myself. I had a small hope that reality was actually something inherently good. I’ve actually worked on a theory and formula for proving the positive existence of reality but I’ve hit a pretty big snag this time around. I’ve had smaller psychological breaks before but this one might be the one that does me in. 

Perhaps depression is a self destruct mechanism for genetically dead ends. Perhaps if someone is born without their emotional needs met from a young age, and perhaps if they were never taught the tools on how to form relationships with other human beings, they enter in a self destruct mode (depression) and eventually kill themselves to allow up resources and social-emotional bandwidth to other better off people, or perhaps people inherently stronger than them, like a form of natural selection built right into our DNA. 

Perhaps depression and suicide isn’t abnormal, perhaps the very fact people like me were born is abnormal and depression is the breakdown of our psyche until eventual course correction (suicide). 

To put it another way, the very fact that someone is depressed is natural and their death is assured via psychological natural selection. Perhaps this process is supposed to happen to people like me. I’m the error. 

I have struggled with depression since I can remember. Probably elementary school or even preschool. I was very alone through my entire life. In preschool id hit kids because they wouldn’t hang out with me, and they wouldn’t hang out with me because I hit them. I can feel the echoes of this well into adulthood. Maybe this is why I’m still lonely, maybe this is why I am unloved. Perhaps I was never to exist in the first place and suicide is just course correction for my bloodline; perhaps I am to stop here. I hope I’ve explained this well enough but it might be a bit esoteric. Basically, if you’re suicidal, you’re supposed to die. There isn’t a struggle with depression because you’re supposed to succumb to depression and die. Trying to live is what’s abnormal. 

Every time I see a large group of friends, usually on social media living the lives that I want to live, or a happy couple enamored in romance, I’m hit with intense, unending jealousy. I always wanted to be loved... I always wanted to be apart of a bigger whole so I could never be alone again. Since I was in middle school I always dreamt of having a wife and kids, nothing makes me happier than thinking about a married life.... something so simple as grocery shopping with my wife or playing with my kids on a beach seems paradisal to me. It’s the highest pleasure that I can think of. But it isn’t meant for me. That kind of happiness was never to be mine. 


I had fought this my entire life of 27 years, and maybe it’s a sign from the universe telling me to bow out. This is my self destruct mechanism. It certainly seems like it, why else was I born this way? I never consented to existence anyways. It’s just a prison of isolation.

The ups of life are just a ploy in an effort to cause maximum despair. I’m only allowed to have positive life experiences so that the next negative experience can crush me even harder than the last. It’s a process of entropy to completely crush my soul. 

There’s no shortage of young men who feel just as I do. If you’re wondering why all these school shootings happen, look to this African proverb: 

“It takes a village to raise a child. And if the village rejects the child, the child will burn down the village to feel its warmth”. 

It’s no secret, it’s plain as day. Young men do these things because we feel isolated and unloved, and uncared for. The isolation gives way depression and jealousy. Jealously gives way to to anger, and anger to hatred,  not of other people (technically), but at the structure of reality. These mass shootings are like a twisted way of showing God how awful they feel inside, it’s an expression of dread more than anything. 

I’m not like that though, I don’t hate people. I love humans more than anything, that’s why I hate being at home all the time. I want to be surrounded by lots of people all the time. I want to be one of them. I want to be a human too. A human that can enjoy life, can enjoy compassion and love, that can enjoy acceptance into reality. Instead, I feel as if I was cast from heaven straight into hell. The love of the universe was never something I could have, it existed to torment me. 

My depression was a sign from God, a sign that I was never to exist in the first place. 

I’ve written more about this in the past and maybe I didn’t get everything out. But I feel so cold and alone, loveless, weak, and in pain. I’m tired of the sorrow and the dread. I am tired of fighting for my life. I’m tired of working meaningless jobs with shit benefits. I quit my job and am currently in community college to transfer to a university. I can’t help but feel like I’ve made a huge mistake by chasing my dreams. I can’t get a full time job, I’ve sent out apps for part time jobs with no reply, so I’m broke. I have no money. I’m couch surfing and have a weeks worth of oatmeal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And I have no healthcare because it’s too expensive and isn’t offered to part timers. I’m tired of living like this. 

That’s why I want to end it. I’m the genetic error, I’m the thing that wasn’t supposed to exist. That’s no ones burden but my own. 

So I will bow out. I feel like I should say thanks to everyone who’s helped me come this far, but I don’t even know if any of it was real or not. Maybe this is all one grand illusion. Maybe my life is just one long nightmare. 

I’m sorry if my death causes you pain. But please understand that there isn’t any other way. It’s time for me to say goodbye. 

Thank you. 

And that’s it. I’m not totally sold on my suicide just yet, but I feel like it’s close. I don’t think I’ve included everything in here, but I think it gets the point across.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve written a suicide note but I’ve sat on it for a few weeks.

It is like I am his little experiment to see how badly you can torture someone before they break. Well I'm broken now. Everything I do backfires in the most awful of ways so I don't even see what the point is anymore. I'm only going on because I don't want to hurt my family. Not my friends though, because I have none. Because they are selfish and only need me... well when they need me. Otherwise they are reaping the benefits of having incredible things happen to them.

Not iPhone and cheap car poor. But no food for days, no roof over my head poor. 

I was tossed out as a teenager, breaking into cars to try and stay warm. Going into the woods to start small fires when I couldn't feel my fingers.  During this time I escaped any way I could. Drugs, and alcohol. At 15 life was already too much, for me. I wish I would've quit life then.

In my late teens my biological mom found me. She lived 500 miles away, but drove to come pick me up. It was like winning the lottery. I had a home, new clothes, and someone who loves me.

It lasted about two months. Then I was kicked out. But this time I had cousins and people who were happy I was around. I was able to stay over. I got a job, life seemed okay. 

Fast forward a few years, and the only jobs I found were dead end. Fast food and phone rooms. I go through my twenties not able to keep up with bills. I ruined my credit, and have never owned anything in my life. 

A couple weeks ago there was a Ted talk on the TV. People talking about rape an trauma. It brought it all back. I can't shake it. I keep thinking of the asshole who sexually assaulted a homeless teenager.

So I try and do something about it. I call an SASP(Sexual assault service provider) they give me some info, point me in the right direction. And I finally call the local police to report the crime. 

He takes a statement, making me to through everything that happened to me more than once. Then says he doesn't know when it will be investigated but someone will eventually call me.

I look up the statute of limitations where it happened and I missed my window by 9 years. Nothing is going to happen. 

So I'm still poor, I still don't know why I exist. And my abuser doesn't have to answer for his Crimes. I want to quit 

I mean the majority of my life has been horrible. Why TF do I have to keep living it.

Just another 30 or 60 years of misery, for what?! So someone else might not get sad. I'm fucking done. I'm fucking done.

Life's not fair, so why cant I just quit early","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ive lived so much of my life poor. Not iPhone and cheap car poor. But no food for days, no roof over my head poor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was tossed out as a teenager, breaking into cars to try and stay warm. Going into the woods to start small fires when I couldn&amp;#39;t feel my fingers.  During this time I escaped any way I could. Drugs, and alcohol. At 15 life was already too much, for me. I wish I would&amp;#39;ve quit life then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my late teens my biological mom found me. She lived 500 miles away, but drove to come pick me up. It was like winning the lottery. I had a home, new clothes, and someone who loves me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It lasted about two months. Then I was kicked out. But this time I had cousins and people who were happy I was around. I was able to stay over. I got a job, life seemed okay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few years, and the only jobs I found were dead end. Fast food and phone rooms. I go through my twenties not able to keep up with bills. I ruined my credit, and have never owned anything in my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago there was a Ted talk on the TV. People talking about rape an trauma. It brought it all back. I can&amp;#39;t shake it. I keep thinking of the asshole who sexually assaulted a homeless teenager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I try and do something about it. I call an SASP(Sexual assault service provider) they give me some info, point me in the right direction. And I finally call the local police to report the crime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He takes a statement, making me to through everything that happened to me more than once. Then says he doesn&amp;#39;t know when it will be investigated but someone will eventually call me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look up the statute of limitations where it happened and I missed my window by 9 years. Nothing is going to happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m still poor, I still don&amp;#39;t know why I exist. And my abuser doesn&amp;#39;t have to answer for his Crimes. I want to quit &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life&amp;#39;s not fair, so why cant I just quit early&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i always had thoughts like &amp;quot;i&amp;#39;ll never find a family/i&amp;#39;m a burden to everyone/i&amp;#39;ll never be successful&amp;quot; and so on - and recently it occurred to me that all of those are coming from nature trying to do it&amp;#39;s thing and force me into societal life/activity like being beneficial/having a partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that i had some more thoughts about nature. It&amp;#39;s very brutal, right? It forces things to follow it&amp;#39;s rules without reason and kill to survive, makes things feel pain and sadness - so why the fuck am i giving into it? I have 6% fat in my body which is all in my fat penis which nature can SUCK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck you, nature, i&amp;#39;m not going to be your slave and give into your shit that wants me to follow 10000 year old instincts, you fucking bloody tyrant. I hope i never ever return to feeling hopeless again just to fuck over nature.&lt;/p&gt;

I've tried a few times but didn't because I didn't know how my mom would take it. She's my rock.

We both come from a pretty strict culture when it comes to the opposite gender, dating, and premarital sex.

My now wife had premarital sex many times before we met. She told me that she had 2 boyfriends before and not long before we met and subsequently got married she met a boy on a dating app and was doing things with him as well. With her first boyfriend, she did not have sex with him but the two would give each other head for about a year and a half. There was a few month break between them when she met her second boyfriend. She started hanging out with him in Ramadan - a month of fasting, and even kissed him - which would break her fast. Within a month, of them starting to talk (this started in Ramadan a few years ago) she had sex with him. The two would go to third about a week or two after the end of fasting month that year. This lasted for a few months and they had sex 1-2 times per month until he broke it off with her 4 months after she lost her virginity to him. Fast forward 3 years and she starts talking to someone on Minder. She and him start sexting and she would also send him pictures of her bare stomach and underwear. She has been wearing hijab since she was a young girl but has obviously taken it off for these men, making this a big deal.

I noticed something was off when we first started talking. She would always reference her past and how it was heavy/dark. I could tell she felt guilty of it but she kept bringing it up. She admitted her sexual past to me 2 weeks before we got married. She also told me that she's freely told many friends, without reason.

I married her because I did not know how to explain this to my parents or her parents. Her parents are very well known in the community and are completely unaware. They believe she is the model daughter.

I did not think this would bother me, I have been in the talks with someone else who also had a past and admitted it to me. I don't think it would have been an issue except for the fact that she would talk to me about all the boys she has spoken to while in bed with me, talking about their bodies. She has compared my genitals to the genitals of the other men she's been with. She's told me that it took some time until sex with me was better than sex with her boyfriend. I've suggested date ideas and she told me she is not willing because she went on a first date before doing similar activities and she did not like it.

I married her partly out of guilt and also because she told me she had repented and that she was not that person anymore. I don't know what to do. She has hurt me deeply and I want to forgive and forget but I don't know how. Islam says we need to overlook the faults of others but this seems like something more.

I know I should have ended things when we first started talking. All of the red flags were there but I was enamored by the person she was presenting herself to be. She is working hard now to make amends and think before she speaks and take my feelings into account but I feel like the damage has been done. Our premarital counselor said that this is a hiccup that we can work through and it can ultimately make us stronger but I can't see that picture at the moment.

Every time I look at her, all I can think is ""this woman has been with multiple other men."" She often claims that she is only mine but she is not - she is a few other mens' as well.

Her admitting all of this to me has made it very difficult to be in a relationship with her. I was abstinent and I waited until I was with her to have marital relations. It is really judgmental but I have these ""Why did I have to get someone's seconds?"" thoughts. I really hope this doesn't get a lot of hate. This is a very culturally sensitive topic that doesn't really fit the American standards in which we grew up in but she, even now, talks about how doing those things is wrong and she judges people who act in the same way she did. She even tried policing how I interact with women which I don't understand. When she goes to work every day and tells me about her male coworkers, I don't say a thing.

All in all, I don't know if I even love her, I don't know why I married her, I don't have the money for divorce, and that one decision I made out of guilt is turning out to be the worst decision I've ever made in my life. So bad that I don't want to live it anymore.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This whole situation makes me want to end my life.

Maybe I could overdose in a forest or bathroom, but then some innocent unsuspecting person is going to get scarred for life. Maybe I can call 911 but there is no way of knowing if they will get their too soon. I’m not scared of death itself I’m more just scared of how much it’s going to hurt, and I don’t want to live or die I just don’t want to exist if that makes any sense.

""You're all alone""

&amp;#x200B;

My suggestions: 

When you feel that voice (the parasite has a mighty one) - know that it's not from your heart or brain. It is an evil that wants you to suffer. 

Tell that voice to go eat a dick, and do what your heart REALLY wants. When you fail, or look foolish, or get rejected - THE VOICE WILL COME BACK STRONGER... tell it to eat a fatter dick and watch when you finally succeed. 

Over time, that parasitic/evil/devilish voice will realize you won't listen - and will fade away.

The people who post on this subreddit have spectacular hearts, care for those around them despite a world of abuse, and just want a peaceful end to it all...

Not fighting yourself (which was born into this world as a pure/innocent being), but fighting a parasite embedded in us by society, or perhaps some ethereal and evil force that preys upon us.

These thoughts and my new outlook came after trying to shoot myself in the head twice on October 27th, but the police say the bullet ""failed to seat in the chamber"" twice, and here I am today.

Bit of backstory.  


I started getting depression around December last year, and I am pretty positive I know the reasons.  


A lot of things happend in December and January, My grandfather got Brain cancer, right after that my Mother started fighting with my dad, and it was bad. Lots of yelling, degrading, embarrassing him in front of members of the family, for example, she started screaming, loud enough so around 4 houses can hear, about how his penis doesn't work properly and listed all the problems. Now, I'm pretty sure no one, man or woman wants there personal problems to be screamed out so everyone can hear, so that made me extremely mad... Every single day I would wake up to screaming, 6-10 am, I honestly was about to go into emergency housing cause it was making my mental health go wild. and then my girlfriend broke up with me, my fault, i fucked up big time but it still made me pretty depressed, and then we also got evicted from our house... This point in my life was the worst I have ever felt, I grew up to be a man and suck it up, I tried to do that for so long, and of course, I had a phone at the time, so I looked up on social. Everywhere I looked it said I needed to talk to someone. So, I did, so every time I was having a mental breakdown I would call one of my best friends, she is also depressed so that kind of gave me some comfort knowing she knows how I feel, didn't really work but i tried anyway.  


Time passes, I never got over my ex, my mental health stopped fluctuating and I kinda just stayed depressed, I couldn't distract myself anymore. At the point in time, I jumped off a building, roof of a 3 story. I was stupid and thought that it would kill me, a lot of people say they regretted right after they jumped, not me. I survived, I hit one of the overhangs that I was meant to jump over and rolled onto the ground, couple bruises and cuts, not even a broken bone. did have to limp home though.  


In March (this year) my ex was doing so much better with her anxiety (that I caused), we began to talk and got back together, we were great and I actually wasn't depressed, I didn't really notice till 3-4 months after we started dating again  
but I was happy, I kinda forgot what it felt to constantly smile, doesn't matter if I was alone, I just smile.   


My Grandfather Passed away on fathers day, and a few months later my girlfriend broke up with me again.

It honestly was so much more painful splitting this time, cause I really felt like me and my ex were getting along.

Like last time the first few days were fine, but then I got back into how I use to feel, and I know now that I'm not scared to jump, and next time I get the urge to jump I will, and this time It won't be a 3 story roof. I don't know if it will be today or in a week but I will for sure. I have been self-harming, I have never done this... And I don't do those small cuts or cuts at all, I'm 6'1 and weigh 100kg (220 lbs) and a lot of that is muscle, I don't go to school and only leave my room twice a day, once in the morning to go to the toilet and once at night, get food. I punch with full power every part of my body, I never bruise unless i do it multiball times. so it's perfect so no one finds out, I mainly punch my temple, jaw and chest. I got to the point where I couldn't eat food for a couple of days cause my jaw would be in so much pain, but I did it anyway, and still do... I can fight the urges to do it, but its when I least expect then is when I do it, for example, I would die in a video game, punch my head in and so on.  


I honestly don't know what's wrong with me, I think I have a mix of sad, mad and being insane   
But anything will help, I live in Australia and have medicare so everything here is free, but the public Psychologists are trash and i would have to pay for a private one with a good Psychologists, feel free to ask questions and I will answer them, go to the moon and back I can handle any question, and I doubt someone can say something over the internet that would make me more depressed or want to kill myself.. SO, don't hold back. i want to be happy again and i only have a certain amount of time before i get the urge to, and who knows maybe i can fight the urge off...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have typed this out more than 5 times and deleted it, I always end up writing 20 or so pages, bit too long I think, but this is as small as I can make it without making it dot points. also venting just a little bit :)&lt;br/&gt;

I got my shit together and I told her
 
 
 
 
I was suicidal and I had to tell HER, so I did



I told her how I felt through the last weeks and how she’d been absent. She was sorry, as she doesn’t want to lose me.

She told me how important I was for her, that touched my heart, something that didn’t ever happen before. She was worried and I felt bad, because I felt like she was wasting herself over me. 
I begged her to be happy, as she always is. She always is happy, she’s the most optimistic person I know. She understands me really well. 

She might be the only person I know of to really understand me. I’m crying right now, as I’m writing.   She’s special, she really does understand me, she goes deep into my subconscious. She knows more than I do about myself.

I feel better

I was delusional and incredibly depressed. I was involuntarily hospitalized, put on a 6 month commitment, and given my most updated diagnosis to date: bipolar I disorder. 

I did not hit rock bottom until November. After that, it was an extremely slow rebuilding process. Most of the relationships in my life had been destroyed. My own psychiatrist told me not to go back to school, not to try to finish college. I said \_fuck that\_ and I finished college. I worked in my field (psychology) for two years. In the interim, I moved across the country on my own. I am now in graduate school for mental health counseling and I do not take any medications. I have never been so happy with my life or had a clearer picture of who I am or what my purpose is. I am literally grateful every fucking day and it's so stupid, I still can't believe I'm here.

I am not saying that you should all believe it will get better. Because when I was in such a dark place, I thought \*only the lucky ones\* get better and I was too fundamentally flawed to be grouped with them. I thought I wasn't fit for life on earth. I was mad at anyone who would told me just to hold on because it would get better. 

Like I said -- you don't have to believe me. I probably wouldn't have believed me. But I was the last fucking person I would have expected to get better, so I feel compelled to share my story in case It gives anyone an inkling of hope. Whatever you can do to stay alive, please do it, because I promise things will get better -- even when you least expect them to. 

&lt;3","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 years ago today, I nearly killed myself. I was delusional and incredibly depressed. I was involuntarily hospitalized, put on a 6 month commitment, and given my most updated diagnosis to date: bipolar I disorder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not hit rock bottom until November. After that, it was an extremely slow rebuilding process. Most of the relationships in my life had been destroyed. My own psychiatrist told me not to go back to school, not to try to finish college. I said _fuck that_ and I finished college. I worked in my field (psychology) for two years. In the interim, I moved across the country on my own. I am now in graduate school for mental health counseling and I do not take any medications. I have never been so happy with my life or had a clearer picture of who I am or what my purpose is. I am literally grateful every fucking day and it&amp;#39;s so stupid, I still can&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;m here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not saying that you should all believe it will get better. Because when I was in such a dark place, I thought *only the lucky ones* get better and I was too fundamentally flawed to be grouped with them. I thought I wasn&amp;#39;t fit for life on earth. I was mad at anyone who would told me just to hold on because it would get better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said -- you don&amp;#39;t have to believe me. I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have believed me. But I was the last fucking person I would have expected to get better, so I feel compelled to share my story in case It gives anyone an inkling of hope. Whatever you can do to stay alive, please do it, because I promise things will get better -- even when you least expect them to. &lt;/p&gt;

I've been on everything, for years. Nothing seems to help. I have tried the medications. I have been hospitalized about 8 times now. I have thried a psychologist and cognitive behavioral therapy. I have lost 100 lbs, went out of my way to socialize, tried to improve my life. I had hobbies and dreams. I even managed to get into a handful of relationships all which ended badly as they just took advantage of me and my money and all 4 of them went back to their ex after a while. I ultimately gave up on work and relationships. I don't enjoy my hobbies. I have no dreams or desires. I lost all my money trying to buy happiness in games and alcohol. I keep thinking about ending it all. I have no reason to keep going except not hurt my family, but even they are sad and hurt because of my life. 


I am having thoughts about suicide. I have the plans. I have the means. This time I have ways that can't fail. I know I can go through with them if I ultimately decide on it. The other option is to go to the hospital again. But would that solve anything? It has failed me half a dozen times before. I have no friends to talk to, since they all got tired of my ""moods"" and ""fake"" attempts to kill myself. They slowly ghosted me until I stopped hearing from them. They don't answer any of my texts. Talking to my family just makes them feel like shit and I don't want that. They also give some horrible advice like ""pretend you are happy and one day you are"" or ""don't feel depressed"" which are annoying. I don't know what to do. I feel defeated. My last attempt was like a week ago or so with my insulin and all it did was make me feel like shit for a while then ok then back to shit then ok, until it leveled out. My body kept producing glucose somehow every time it dipped. 


I plan on driving to the beach, getting drunk, and jumping into the water. I don't know how to swim. I'd do this at night and isolated. Also planned on buying a cheap gun with what I've been saving and shooting myself in the woods. Or simply piss off the wrong people or cops. But that one is not 100% sure. Should I go to the hospital again? Talk to parents? Go with the plans? I don't even know what I want to do","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am 33m, diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, Severe Generalized Anxiety, Severe Insomnia, Major Depression with recurrent suicidal tendencies, Diabetes Neuropathy, and general intense pain through my whole body due to several attempts to end my life which involved car crashes and jumping off a building. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been on everything, for years. Nothing seems to help. I have tried the medications. I have been hospitalized about 8 times now. I have thried a psychologist and cognitive behavioral therapy. I have lost 100 lbs, went out of my way to socialize, tried to improve my life. I had hobbies and dreams. I even managed to get into a handful of relationships all which ended badly as they just took advantage of me and my money and all 4 of them went back to their ex after a while. I ultimately gave up on work and relationships. I don&amp;#39;t enjoy my hobbies. I have no dreams or desires. I lost all my money trying to buy happiness in games and alcohol. I keep thinking about ending it all. I have no reason to keep going except not hurt my family, but even they are sad and hurt because of my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am having thoughts about suicide. I have the plans. I have the means. This time I have ways that can&amp;#39;t fail. I know I can go through with them if I ultimately decide on it. The other option is to go to the hospital again. But would that solve anything? It has failed me half a dozen times before. I have no friends to talk to, since they all got tired of my &amp;quot;moods&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fake&amp;quot; attempts to kill myself. They slowly ghosted me until I stopped hearing from them. They don&amp;#39;t answer any of my texts. Talking to my family just makes them feel like shit and I don&amp;#39;t want that. They also give some horrible advice like &amp;quot;pretend you are happy and one day you are&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t feel depressed&amp;quot; which are annoying. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I feel defeated. My last attempt was like a week ago or so with my insulin and all it did was make me feel like shit for a while then ok then back to shit then ok, until it leveled out. My body kept producing glucose somehow every time it dipped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on driving to the beach, getting drunk, and jumping into the water. I don&amp;#39;t know how to swim. I&amp;#39;d do this at night and isolated. Also planned on buying a cheap gun with what I&amp;#39;ve been saving and shooting myself in the woods. Or simply piss off the wrong people or cops. But that one is not 100% sure. Should I go to the hospital again? Talk to parents? Go with the plans? I don&amp;#39;t even know what I want to do&lt;/p&gt;

2 years ago I had left my parents place w my dog, ended up in an abusive relationship which I am still in.

Was never a mooch, drug addict, anything to warrant their behavior the last 3 years.

2 weeks ago I had a heart attack. Need to follow up w cardiologist in order for my insurance to pay, but I don't want to. What's the point in fighting for a life I'm so miserable in?

I made it through college by avoiding as much social contact as I could; I literally went weeks without talking to anyone, including my roommates. I had five different housemates in three years of college, and I don't think I exchanged more than a few words with any of them; most times I couldn't even bear being in the same room with them. I went to the grocery store at five in the morning to avoid crowds, and I seldom shopped anywhere that didn't have self-checkout machines.  I was and still am afraid to respond to e-mails and texts, even ones from my parents.

I feel like my life is over, basically. I graduated college with a B.A. despite never talking to a single professor, including my senior thesis adviser, but I'm scared to death of having even a menial job. Interviews terrify me, and just looking for work on the Internet is enough to get my anxiety going. I started seeing a new therapist a few weeks ago, but I'm not sure it's helping. I do the things she asks me to do, or at least some of them, but the anxiety hasn't really dissipated. Each new task, each interaction - and these are simple, laughably innocuous things, like buying a drink from a convenience store, or ordering coffee at Starbucks - fills me with the same sense of dread, a feeling that makes my heart race and my stomach churn. And, though I'm being totally truthful here, I tend to minimize the extent of my anxiety in conversations with therapists and my parents. I'm deeply embarrassed by the fact that I struggle so heavily with things most people wouldn't think twice about, things that elementary school-aged kids could probably do with ease. I can't help but picture myself at 25, at 30, at 40, wasting away in my parents' house, living off a goodwill probably fostered by their suspicion (not unwarranted) that if they kick me out, I'll immediately kill myself, or at least starve to death when I can't summon up the courage to walk into a soup kitchen.

Reading this back, I'm not sure why I wrote it, except to vent. I'm painfully aware that there are no easy solutions to social anxiety this bad, and I don't expect people on Reddit, especially people with their own problems that no doubt match or surpass mine in terms of severity, to provide what two years of therapy and a slew of medications couldn't. Maybe someone else with social anxiety can take solace in the fact that they aren't the only person suffering in this particular way. I've noticed that most online suicide prevention resources emphasize depression at the exclusion of other, similarly debilitating mental illnesses, and I hate to think that other suicidal social phobics might feel invalid as a result. I don't have any plans to kill myself yet, but whenever I think about my future, when I think about what my life might be like two or three years down the line, I sometimes feel like suicide is my only option. It's just so hard for me to imagine existing long-term in a world where a baseline level of sociability is more or less necessary for a half-decent, self-sufficient life.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had some degree of social phobia for pretty much my entire life, but it&amp;#39;s gotten steadily worse over the past few years, to the point where almost any interaction with another person - or even the prospect of it - inspires a deep, soul-wrenching dread, and near-panic attack levels of anxiety.

I have nothing to lose now but my life itself.

Found out the ex I haven’t gotten over got married over the weekend. I’m sure to most this is a “whatever” situation; to me, it was devastating.

I’ve been depressed and had suicidal thoughts for many years. In fact, my depression and anxiety got in the way of our relationship, just one of many reasons she rightfully dumped me.

I’m not mad at her, I’m glad she’s happy and found someone to spend her life with. I wish it was me but I know I wasn’t good enough and that really hurts me.

So last night I got out an old belt to make a makeshift noose. Needless to say, as I’m typing this now, it didn’t work. It’s not as easy as movies make it seem. I’m a big guy and even with a large belt it didn’t have much length after being knotted around the doorknob and placed over my head. I assumed a crouching position, as it was the only one that seemed to work, and I could feel myself quickly losing blood to my head.

I stopped for two reasons. 1. I don’t live alone and I was scared that the unorthodox position would make a lot of noise. I didn’t want attention drawn to my attempt. 2. Despite this, I was scared. Until you’ve had the noose over your neck you don’t know the fear of death. And this is coming from someone who wants his suffering to end.

I am sure I’ll attempt this again with a different ligature and maybe in an isolated location. This is not the result of a hasty, impulsive decision. I’ve carefully considered my future and what’s in store for me. There is nothing I look forward to. Everything that interests me is in the past. I have no prospects for a future and no passion or drive or ambition to find something. I’ve run out of options; this latest news of the one that got away getting away was the cherry on top.

Hey, so this is going to be a long post, so consider yourself warned. I’m also not from an English-speaking country, but I’m trying to remedy it by using Word and Grammarly, so you hopefully won’t die. TL; DR at the bottom. Throwaway account for anonymity.

I’m a 21M Danish student, living in a student’s apartment, which will become relevant later. I’ve officially gotten the diagnosis of Asperger’s from a psychiatrist, but my private doctor also recognizes me as having mild depression and severe anxiety.

So, I’m not going to go too far into detail about a few things about my life, as it’s quite the shit show, but if asked, I’ll elaborate as I’m not shy about sharing, but don’t want to make this unreadably long.

I’ll first talk about my family situation, as it becomes important later. I was born into a family of 3, my parents and a brother. However, when I was about 5, my parents broke up, and it wasn’t a pretty break up. The result from that was that I and my brother would live at our mom’s house, due to my father not having signed some papers as he thought they’d be together forever, and so only visiting our fathers on weekends every 2 weeks. Which wasn’t exactly a good thing.

For you see, my mother was an alcoholic, which until I entered my teens, I wasn’t aware of due to my Asperger’s. I knew something was wrong though. My mother would drink wine every day, and from what my father tells me she did it while taking some medicine that essentially amplified how drunk she got. When drunk, my mother wouldn’t physically abuse us, but she would emotionally bully me and my brother. She acted quite bipolar, one moment she would be all nice, the next moment you could see it like a switch behind her eyes turning on and she wouldn’t yell, but she would start interrogating me and my brother about what happened when we were at our father's. Which we eventually got tired of and told her off, but when we’d do so, she starts crying and tell us: “I’m the world's worst mother/I’m just so terrible/You have no idea how your father treated me.” Etc. etc. playing on our empathy making us feel terrible about ourselves for years. I recognize this as something that could come from abuse, but I honestly don’t see my dad doing it, he’s a very pleasant mild-mannered guy that never touched us, nor did I see him drunk. Even his choice in girlfriends and eventual wife was those that would be considered the dominant person in the relationship. He also always tried to make visiting him a safe haven as he knew how our mother could get.

Alas, back to the topic. This went on for years, well into our teens. My father eventually moved away, to the other side of the country, making us commute every second weekend for hours on bus and ferry, which didn’t help our relationship much. It eventually deteriorated into us seeing him less and less – until we didn’t visit him at all towards my middle teens, around the time of my diagnosis.

Our mother would switch out boyfriends every 3 years or so, some would be good influences, others not so much. One, in particular, was a great father figure, honestly better than my dad at the time as he moved away. But eventually, he had to go too, for abusing her apparently which was the same time as my diagnosis started to show itself more readily apparent. I started noticing that I wasn’t quite getting the same information as everyone else, and at the same time, I also moved schools after a quite bad ending at my old one due to it. At this point, I also had a conversation with my mother about her alcohol abuse and told her I couldn’t take it anymore. My brother had already left home at 16 years old dude to not being able to take it and was barely at home before that anyway. So, I was always all alone about it, either with or without a stepfather. Personally, I chose to find my safe spot inside my room, in front of my PC, but I still heard every ‘argument’.

Eventually, although not immediately, which you can’t really expect, she got better. Today I haven’t seen her like that in years, despite my brother pointing it out every time she sips some wine. I guess I’m dull like that, but oh well.

This is all a kind of setup to explain, that I can’t really ask my family for advice or much help. I’ve over the last few years asked my mother and father about events that I remember as very ‘bad times’ in my childhood and both have given me two very different scenarios. My fathers is reasonable has better grounds for being real than my mother. But if my mother tells me my father is a psychopath, which I very sincerely doubt too objectively. Who am I to trust? I don’t feel secure enough that their advice will ever help my situation and has been largely on my own. Even get my diagnosis was me going to the doctor on my own. As they both said I was just making it up.

Anyway, this is more of a prologue to the eventual current problem I’m asking for advice for.

About 5 years ago, I got the diagnosis of Asperger’s, which is relatively late at the age of 16, I was also suffering from depression and anxiety at that point in my life, albeit not to the extent I am now. I barely met my classes in 9th grade, and only because of understanding teachers I probably didn’t have to take it again and got slightly below-average grades. At this time, my only friends’ number on one hand, and those weren’t from my school and I never talked to them about serious matters, despite very much needed to talk to someone at that time.

After 9th grade, I tried to get into a Gymnasium, of which I was denied due to absence and my guidance counselor suggesting it probably wouldn’t work out. Which is fair, it probably wouldn’t have. I got once of those ‘project’ like schools, which had its own bus that we took to get there, out in nowhere every day and then we’d have 10th-grade classes. Eventually, I had so much absence there as well that I couldn’t continue, and my problems were only getting worse with anxiety and depression. In all honesty, I wasn’t trying to get better. I felt really low at that point.

Here, is where I started to ‘regain hope’ for my mother as a parent. Something I sometimes doubt my brother has. She started working hard on getting me into something best described as a ‘daycare’ for autistic people that we're unable to function in schools etc. and needed a safe place to develop to a functioning degree. I also started working to get better, personally. I started reading psychology, body language, etc. to really understand not so much what ‘Asperger’s’ is, but what my individual difficulties are and learn to make up for them. I can honestly say it’s the best thing that could happen, I was a real piece of shit in all honest before that and not the smartest tool in the shed either. I, however, learned a lot and have been complimented on my emotional intelligence increasingly ever since. My psychologist now even goes as far as to say I’m ‘too smart for my own good’. Aka needlessly complicated things.

Back to topic. The ‘daycare’ was nice but eventually wasn’t enough for me as I outgrew it by actually working individually on self-improvement and taking my 10th grade on the side. My social worker, let’s call her SW, also made that consensus and recommended and IT-oriented thing for people with an autism-related diagnosis. Which was nice, but not really where my passion lied. I still had problems at this point heavily with anxiety, but somehow made it to moving out into a student’s apartment. I’m about 18, bordering on 19 at this point. Moving out was amazing, he changed everything- I developed faster than I had ever thought possible, I came out of depression mostly too.

But as the IT-thing didn’t work out, SW saw this as an opportunity for a new psychology-autism specific mentor thing, not quite sure what to call it in English. But it helped me a lot, previously I’d had a personal vendetta against psychologists. I took a bit of a ‘Good Will Hunting’ narcissism approach to it and didn’t want them to pick my brain apart. But eventually agreed to it, which was amazing for me as it provided a helpful foundation for the newly gained growth spurt of moving out. My anxiety started to decrease, I met up more often to the meetings and eventually finished some school programs from online schooling.

Now to more recent events, I felt I was on top of the world, figuratively and comparatively speaking ofc. I was still a far cry from ‘normal’. But I was getting there, so I eventually started doing interning. Which in Denmark is also used for development for ‘people like me’ to work on their anxiety and start meeting up more. Ofc it was all unpaid, but still great for my quality of life. I also got accepted into the Gymnasium I applied to outta 9th grade, but for a class specifically for people with autism-related problems.

Then everything started going down the drain. I was in my last 3 weeks of interning, when I suddenly one day at work, had the shits, like the real bad anxiety kind and from bad food. But I was deadly afraid of using toilets outside my house. So, I eventually went to my superior told him I didn’t feel well and excused myself to go home. However, the bus had just left 5 minutes earlier, but it wasn’t a long walk home. Or so I thought, my stomach started getting increasingly worse and I was sweating bullets while my anxiety went 120% thinking everyone ‘knew’ I was about to shit myself. About 2/3th the way home, I had to walk into a forest and do the deed there. I’m not going to go into much more detail, after that I went home without incident. But I think something inside my psyche broke on that day. Every day after, I’d have increasing difficulty getting to work, taking days off due to my anxiety basically going back to day 1 again. None of the exercises worked that I had previously done and when I’d get there, I’d usually go home early due to the fear of public bathrooms, etc. I just felt like I had to go to the toilet all the time, albeit not extremely so. But it was incredibly taxing on me.

Eventually, however, I had to start school. The introduction day went fine, I went to the toilet twice and everything went relatively well. The next day, however. Usually, as the special class, we don’t have any classes with ‘the normals’ and would only have 1 type of class with them. For me, that was Art class. And as luck would have it, which the teachers also later apologized and promised would never happen again. We had it the very first class 1st day. Fuck me, right? Well, 5 minutes into the class, I tell the teacher I got to go the toilet real quick, “We kind of just started the lecture, but okay”. And so, I went, did the deed and came back. Introductions have started, they’re really slow though. Nice people all around. 10 minutes later. Omfgawdsa I must go right now to the toilet. But I just went, would be rude to leave again. So, I took my bag and left, couldn’t deal with it. Went to my mentor’s office and found she only got to school 2 hours from there. So, I couldn’t explain myself to anyone really, I packed my stuff and went home. I ofc. I did the only responsible thing and messaged both my mentor and teacher about the ‘why’ and such. But my bad stomach, as I would call it, fed on my despair and grew incredibly from this experience. I didn’t meet in the next 2 days.

On Monday, the next week, I had sought out a doctor’s appointment, one with my psychology mentor, which was still ongoing, and a meeting with my school mentor (They’re separate). And I also had fresh courage of a weekend well-rested- Well… I wish I could tell you all that I was brave in the face of adversity. But I’ve never felt so much anxiety and fear as I had 2 minutes into sitting on that bus. I felt my lower half was about to explode from built-up tacos or something, and my fear was playing the knowledge that I was 20+ minutes away from a toilet and would deed my pants before that. So, I gave in, I stepped off the bus the next stop and went home. Wrote more messages to the teachers etc.

As great as free health care is, it’s, however, a shit show waiting line, had the appointment a month later. And they guard their emergency times with the might of Thanos himself, so someone so insecure as I didn’t stand a chance. Because being unable to attend school isn’t an emergency, at least not until a week later where I got an emergency time for the doctor due to not having met at school.

After meeting my doctor and taking some tests, it was concluded, as everyone told me, it was psychosomatic. Oh well, we in the for the long haul then. I got new medication to deal with some of the anxiety and some fiber pills to deal with the stomach. Wish it worked though, even after upping the dose it didn’t do enough. I, as the ever-pragmatic person I was, dealt with it and thought several tens of ways to deal with it and started implementing it in several ways. Eventually, I started meeting up in some classes.

It’s important to know now, that apparently, I was never meant to take this education over 2 years, I was meant to take it over 3, effectually halving the number of classes the first two years. But there had been an administrative mistake and I was put on the 2 years. So, they put me over on the right one, and I didn’t have nearly as many classes and chose the days I could muster my courage up for the more important days. I was progressing too, at a decent speed. But then they started pressuring me about the fact that I hadn’t tried my Art class since the first day, and I wasn’t ready, but sure I’ll try because I’m a pushover. And it went bad again and didn’t meet up for a week. That was 2 weeks ago.

Right now, I feel like I just can’t get there fast enough you know? And would eventually be kicked out. I’m in dire need of advice, there’s nobody I can really talk to about it besides my Psychology mentor, who I’m at the point where the offer is running out and the government isn’t very happy for prolonging that kind of thing as soon as you’re considering within a proper education.

I’ve had several thoughts; Maybe ask to go to a psychiatrist for evaluation of proper medicine, as the ones I get now are prescribed by a general doctor. Maybe just accepting I won’t be able to this year and drop out? But then I wouldn’t be able to live in my apartment as it’s only for students. And you can only live half a year before they throw you out without ongoing education. I’d first be able to join an education after next summer.

I’m so very very lost right now, I just don’t know what to do. As the title says, I feel I’m going to crash and burn at this point. I also feel like this happens every time I make enough progress, I crash and burn. I've lately also started idealization, which to me, until now, has seemed like a selfish action despite how low I got. But now, I feel like I just won't ever make it out of this hole, no matter how fast I crawl.

TL; DR – After starting education in a special-autism class, I developed anxious stomach issues and have become barely able to attend classes and unsure what to do. Got no one else to really ask.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, so this is going to be a long post, so consider yourself warned.

So, they put me over on the right one, and I didn’t have nearly as many classes and chose the days I could muster my courage up for the more important days. I was progressing too, at a decent speed. But then they started pressuring me about the fact that I hadn’t tried my Art class since the first day, and I wasn’t ready, but sure I’ll try because I’m a pushover. And it went bad again and didn’t meet up for a week. That was 2 weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I feel like I just can’t get there fast enough you know? And would eventually be kicked out. I’m in dire need of advice, there’s nobody I can really talk to about it besides my Psychology mentor, who I’m at the point where the offer is running out and the government isn’t very happy for prolonging that kind of thing as soon as you’re considering within a proper education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had several thoughts; Maybe ask to go to a psychiatrist for evaluation of proper medicine, as the ones I get now are prescribed by a general doctor. Maybe just accepting I won’t be able to this year and drop out? But then I wouldn’t be able to live in my apartment as it’s only for students. And you can only live half a year before they throw you out without ongoing education. I’d first be able to join an education after next summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so very very lost right now, I just don’t know what to do. As the title says, I feel I’m going to crash and burn at this point. I also feel like this happens every time I make enough progress, I crash and burn. I&amp;#39;ve lately also started idealization, which to me, until now, has seemed like a selfish action despite how low I got. But now, I feel like I just won&amp;#39;t ever make it out of this hole, no matter how fast I crawl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL; DR – After starting education in a special-autism class, I developed anxious stomach issues and have become barely able to attend classes and unsure what to do. Got no one else to really ask.&lt;/p&gt;

I was in early high school when I got the ear infections, about 6 years ago. The infection lasted awhile cause I had to change to different meds since the first batch didn't work but it was gone and that was that. Or you'd think so right? Nope. Over the next 6 years I would slowly lose control of my eustachian tube which is basically what controls ear pressure and whether your inner ear is open or shut. The condition is called Patulous Eustachian Tube (PET) and it's a rare ear condition that not many people have. It took me about a year to self diagnose myself because doctors didn't know what was wrong, and it was later confirmed as PET once I could get in contact with an ENT who understood the condition.

It slowly took everything and I mean EVERYTHING. What began as not being able to do extreme exercise or drink coffee slowly slipped to not being able to talk without preparing my ear for it because I'd hear my voice from inside my body because my ear is in an open state (similar to when you yawn and they open and you hear your breath temporarily) to not being able to exert myself at all because if my heart rate goes up my ear opens and it's like a hurricane is going on inside my head.

These symptoms happen constantly now, even without being provoked and while I have temporary remedies to stop my ears from opening they're really painful and just cause different more bearable symptoms. Currently my only treatment is an estrogen spray that I spray up my nose and basically swell the tube shut which feels fucked but hey it's better than hearing my breathing and voice.

There's not really any treatment for the condition as it's quite rare and the surgery suggested by my ENT has only been performed twice in Australia with underwhelming and temporary results and I'm too scared to have it done because if it makes this any worse I don't think I could handle living. So basically the only advice I leave with every time is to gain weight but for the life of me I can't. I've seen naturopaths and all but I just don't put on weight

It started with my right ear and the left was fine until about 1 month ago. Fucks me what's changed.

This is a text wall already so I'll get to where I'm at now.

Dropped out of uni and quit work 5 months or so ago because I got to the stage where controlling my ears state was a full time fucking job of doing nothing but eat and don't exert or talk too much cause it'll fuck my ear and I'll hear myself breathe and talk from inside my body, sometimes even get to hear the blood gushing around my ear if I'm lucky.

Broke up with girlfriend about 2 months ago which was mutual but sucks because I tried so hard to make it work even with my condition and still with my condition put in more work that she ever did. And at the end of it couldn't put me over her. She was sick at the time and getting sick makes my condition really bad and I'd already been sick for literally 2 months and was just getting better. I didnt want to get sick so I said no to hanging with her and she had the fucking audacity to call my situation a ""holiday"" and she'd have seen me if I was sick. Oh and she didn't like that I smoked weed and at the time it was the only thing that fixed my ear (didnt have estrogen spray) but she didnt like that so that was my fault? I guess she was just like everyone else who thinks it's just a little ear problem when in reality it's a main bodily sense gone completely rouge and prevents me from using them at all for their purpose.

So that was a 2 year relationship gone during my hardest time where my world is falling apart.

My days and nights are now made up of playing runescape and smoking weed to distract me from the reality of living in my own body. Where I constantly hear my ears crack, they don't clear pressure, I hear myself, my breathing and even my god damn blood flowing around my ears. 

I delve deeper into depression every day, lost an item on the stupid fucking game which was worth around 1.4k AUD at the time which was all i had and you are all probably like fuck this guys a loser but imagine not being able to go outside or have sugar(coffee or any stimulant) or talk because it will fuck up your ear, so I smoke and invest my time and almost worth into this game trying to make it through my life without noticing life because it's fucking painful being here. I'm always fucking mad because all day every day I have this shit condition annoying me and stopping me from doing anything I want without negative repercussions and the game I used to distract myself just reminds me of what I had and how far I am from that again just like being a normal human.

And I don't even want to smoke, I'm slowly losing my mind but without it my ears get so bad, I have no chance of sleeping and I begin to have an actual memory of how shit my entire day has been, and the longer I'm sober the more shit days there are to remember.

I recently got prescribed valium because I have very bad anxiety but didn't get that sorted before my ear fucked up and I can't go through finding what medication works for me in my current situation cause they all make it worse before it gets better.

So I sit here, borderline addicted to valium because it's the only thing that takes away the anxiety and calms my ear. And I get paid $200 a fortnite which is instantly gone on my ridiculous amount of pills, ear spray, fuel and other expenses so I barely can afford food or to do anything. Put my application for disability payments in when I stopped working and the meeting has only just been setup for next month so I've got a few more weeks to struggle through just to see if they will allow me payments with my rare condition.

I'm so fucking stressed all the time that I just clock out emotionally and try let everything pass by until my ears do something that just inspires dread within me. Dread of existing with what it just did. Dread that it can get worse. And trust me it just keeps getting worse. Can't sleep with hurricanes. Was that sound from the real world or from me. Fuck.

I'm sorry for so much text is a bit of a ramble and I might have doubled up a bit so I'm sorry again, this is still just a generalization of the things I have going on and I don't think anyone would care to read a whole book of why my life's currently fucked so ill end it but if you made it this far thank you. At least after this 6 year sanity test I'll had hopefully left a memory about me with someone if I decide to take an exit. Which at this rate I contemplate every day, challenging myself to make it through another one with this shit. But I'm getting tired man.

Tldr: I'm claustrophobic in my own body due to a rare condition and life fucking sucks","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really know how to start this or why I&amp;#39;m doing this but I just want someone to know what&amp;#39;s in my head even if it is just strangers so I&amp;#39;ll just type out what&amp;#39;s happened since it started cause I&amp;#39;m trapped here on the floor with no escape but death and I really don&amp;#39;t want to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in early high school when I got the ear infections, about 6 years ago. The infection lasted awhile cause I had to change to different meds since the first batch didn&amp;#39;t work but it was gone and that was that. Or you&amp;#39;d think so right? Nope. Over the next 6 years I would slowly lose control of my eustachian tube which is basically what controls ear pressure and whether your inner ear is open or shut. The condition is called Patulous Eustachian Tube (PET) and it&amp;#39;s a rare ear condition that not many people have. It took me about a year to self diagnose myself because doctors didn&amp;#39;t know what was wrong, and it was later confirmed as PET once I could get in contact with an ENT who understood the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It slowly took everything and I mean EVERYTHING. What began as not being able to do extreme exercise or drink coffee slowly slipped to not being able to talk without preparing my ear for it because I&amp;#39;d hear my voice from inside my body because my ear is in an open state (similar to when you yawn and they open and you hear your breath temporarily) to not being able to exert myself at all because if my heart rate goes up my ear opens and it&amp;#39;s like a hurricane is going on inside my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These symptoms happen constantly now, even without being provoked and while I have temporary remedies to stop my ears from opening they&amp;#39;re really painful and just cause different more bearable symptoms. Currently my only treatment is an estrogen spray that I spray up my nose and basically swell the tube shut which feels fucked but hey it&amp;#39;s better than hearing my breathing and voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s not really any treatment for the condition as it&amp;#39;s quite rare and the surgery suggested by my ENT has only been performed twice in Australia with underwhelming and temporary results and I&amp;#39;m too scared to have it done because if it makes this any worse I don&amp;#39;t think I could handle living. So basically the only advice I leave with every time is to gain weight but for the life of me I can&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ve seen naturopaths and all but I just don&amp;#39;t put on weight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with my right ear and the left was fine until about 1 month ago. Fucks me what&amp;#39;s changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a text wall already so I&amp;#39;ll get to where I&amp;#39;m at now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropped out of uni and quit work 5 months or so ago because I got to the stage where controlling my ears state was a full time fucking job of doing nothing but eat and don&amp;#39;t exert or talk too much cause it&amp;#39;ll fuck my ear and I&amp;#39;ll hear myself breathe and talk from inside my body, sometimes even get to hear the blood gushing around my ear if I&amp;#39;m lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broke up with girlfriend about 2 months ago which was mutual but sucks because I tried so hard to make it work even with my condition and still with my condition put in more work that she ever did. And at the end of it couldn&amp;#39;t put me over her. She was sick at the time and getting sick makes my condition really bad and I&amp;#39;d already been sick for literally 2 months and was just getting better. I didnt want to get sick so I said no to hanging with her and she had the fucking audacity to call my situation a &amp;quot;holiday&amp;quot; and she&amp;#39;d have seen me if I was sick. Oh and she didn&amp;#39;t like that I smoked weed and at the time it was the only thing that fixed my ear (didnt have estrogen spray) but she didnt like that so that was my fault?

This is my first post - so please bear with me.

I've been living with Aspergers for a quarter of my life now - introvert, active listener, overthinker, very strategic, fixated on details, never had a fixed group of friends, because I always stood out &amp; always refused to integrate into any group dynamics because I had self-respect, always struggled academically because I couldn't agree with the conventional methods of teaching.

Still I managed to complete a Master level education, Met my best friend (who's currently working and living very far away from me now), and publish an academic paper &amp; got admitted to a second prestigious, interdisciplinary Master program very few enter last year. This is my second year in which I need to orient my skills towards a PhD.

In the past two weeks, I've been dumped by the girl I was dating - later humiliated by her and her new boyfriend - also they are shocked by the fact that I quicky forgave her &amp; want to be friends again, isolated by the people I thought were my friends( I met them when I was happy &amp; things were going well - now they can't bear to be with the sad me ), many of my applications for an internship got rejected, got rejected in an important interview, forced to change my semester plan and validate courses which will be completely new to me - have to keep shuttling my main course &amp; the courses I have to take &amp; take care of a lot of legal stuff.

My life is too precious to me &amp; I know if I wish to make a real difference in this world and be recognized for it - I will have to keep going.

But the daily stress and attacks on my self-worth are making it a challenge - the constant rejections, the lack of awareness, being left out of conversations &amp; meet-ups, the feeling of exclusion and being out of loop with everyone's life is draining the feeling of belonging I had @ the same university before - despite me being incharge of a club and being very familiar with the staff and a lot of students.

To cope, I've been reading "" A survival guide for people living with Asperger's syndrome -  [http://www.autism-help.org/aspergers-guide-intro.htm](http://www.autism-help.org/aspergers-guide-intro.htm) "" for now &amp; trying my best to concentrate on my courses &amp; developing skills - but how do I bring back the same motivation &amp; drive I had before?

Time is running out - so please help me understand how do I get back on my feet.

P.S Despite having Aspergers - I was never given any special treatment, often had to pretend that things were ok - when they weren't &amp; lie compulsively, How do I become authentic - without being pessimistic &amp; a dead-weight?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi redditors,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S Despite having Aspergers - I was never given any special treatment, often had to pretend that things were ok - when they weren&amp;#39;t &amp;amp; lie compulsively, How do I become authentic - without being pessimistic &amp;amp; a dead-weight?&lt;/p&gt;

Laying there all the time I do nothing but look back at my rather short life. Involving sexual, physical, and more importantly mental abuse. Addiction to prescription meds as well as being on and off so damn many that doctors described me as in a constant manic state. Being in and out of facilities more times than I can count. And even being there while watching my father die at an rather early age of thirty-four to a condition that would have taken his life at an earlier frame of time if not for his lung transplant. Having said condition as well (mimics Cystic Fibrosis) I never find comfort in simple tasks such as breathing.

It's been seventeen years on this Earth and slowly but surely the years get worse.

When I get home I immediately walk into the wreck of a house and get ready for bed. I often spend around eighteen hours in and out of sleep. Laying there all the time I do nothing but look back at my rather short life. Involving sexual, physical, and more importantly mental abuse. Addiction to prescription meds as well as being on and off so damn many that doctors described me as in a constant manic state. Being in and out of facilities more times than I can count. And even being there while watching my father die at an rather early age of thirty-four to a condition that would have taken his life at an earlier frame of time if not for his lung transplant. Having said condition as well (mimics Cystic Fibrosis) I never find comfort in simple tasks such as breathing.

I am not someone who can handle stress well and the workload is overwhelming me. I self-harmed again a couple weeks ago, something I haven’t done in three years.

I fantasize about killing myself almost every day, I have been fantasizing about doing so for the last 8 hours straight, unable to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been unhappy for so long, I regret so many of the choices I made as a teenager/young adult. I had a shitty upbringing which can't necessarily be blamed but I feel like it contributed to my negativity and how I handled my situations growing up. My mother would constantly take out her rage and bitterness against my father for their divorce on me, the phrase ""you're just like your father"" is burned into my memory forever. She'd rant about what an embarrassment I was to her friends and co-workers anytime I screwed up and would hound me relentlessly.

I used to think my father cared a lot more because he was more laid back and didn't scream at me when things were bad, but being full grown I realize neither parent put 100% effort into it. I have almost zero relationship with most of my immediate family, everyone is an hour drive or more away and even when I get there the vibe is always like ""when is one of us going to leave?"". I feel like such a burden on my father and my mother is desperately trying to compensate for the years of emotional and verbal abuse now that i'm an adult but it really just feels like so little.

&amp;#x200B;

In high school I made friends with the people who like to party, did a lot of underage drinking and pot smoking. I was a rebellious angsty youth and I pushed basically everyone away from me who wasn't in my party circle. Come graduation i have 2 friends in my graduating class who both cut ties with me and became meth junkies. Now I have 1 friend left who was a couple years older than me but the relationship is like, 75/25. Im always driving to see him (40 min trip), always going out of my way to work around his schedule and I feel so undervalued.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have no friends from high school, a poor relationship at best with my parents and a non-existent one with my siblings (which is why they weren't even mentioned).

&amp;#x200B;

I do have a girlfriend that I have been with for a long time (8 years\~), she is older than me by about 15 years and that has created its own set of issues. She has two sons who are adult age.. yes she got pregnant very early in life.. not a fact I love but something that can't be changed. These two sons can't stand me. The oldest believes I am a huge loser and am holding his mother back because I have a chronic illness (Ulcerative colitis, sister disease to Chrohn's disease if you're familiar with that) and don't make a significant amount of money due to my poor health and inability to hold tougher jobs. Her other son just doesn't like my personality and over a year ago he told me more than once ""fuck you"" and that ""I should just kill myself"". These incidents are months old and they have never apologized. This stings for two reasons, the most obvious is that its like great, more people who just fucking can't stand me. But the worst of the situation is that I love this woman and wish so much that we could have a child together. But her ex-husband forced her to get her tubes tied and so if I stay in  relationship with the only person on the planet who has ever fully respected me, I can never be a father to my own child and the kids she already has hate my guts and encourage me to kill myself, acknowledge fully what they have done, and refuse to apologize or make amends. I've tried so hard to get an apology for these verbal abuses because they eat away at me, but they refuse. In the back of my mind, I know that people refuse to apologize when they feel they have done nothing wrong. So maybe they are right, maybe I am a loser. Maybe i am holding my girlfriend back and maybe suicide is the right call for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight I was invited to attend someones 40th birthday bash at a restaurant, a guy i've known a couple years. I thought great, maybe this will be a fun social event. Finally! I've been waiting for a chance to branch out. I attend with my girlfriend, i have a couple of 5 minute conversations with a few people i'd met previously through the birthday man, but before long we're sitting at the bar talking to each other and nobody is showing any interest in talking to us. We even sat down near the birthday man himself to be near the center of the action but somehow peoples backs were always facing us. Then we tried to initiate conversation and were shut down. It was clear we weren't wanted, or at least not appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

It was in this moment that I realized how alone I am. 

\- I'm 27 and i have 1 'real' friend where I put in 3/4ths of the effort to maintain said friendship. 

\- the relationship im in is one of the most stressful situations of my entire life because the desire/want to be a father is so strong but its not possible considering the technical side and the kids she does have fucking hate me and want me out of her/their lives.

\- i was an unlikable shit growing up and have only myself to blame for being isolated

\- my family relationship is quite poor, i have no strong bonds or trust with anyone. I could never open up about this to any of my family.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, in this horribly long winded terribly formatted post, I have developed a xanax addiction lately to cope with the stress and depression I feel but the smaller doses I was taking are slowly starting to not work the same and I feel like I'm headed down a path of serious abuse and then suicide. 

&amp;#x200B;

I publicly apologized on facebook to all my previous classmates and acquaintances tonight after not using the site for years, for being such a burden on everyone growing up. I hate myself and my life. I made so many terrible decisions. I just want to end my life. I don't know if I will ever be happy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;not using a throw away because i just don&amp;#39;t care  &lt;/p&gt;

I hated that I felt discouraged about school and my future. I hate that I was sexually assaulted. I hated that I had a tumor in my breast thinking I could've had breast cancer. I hated that I was domestically abused. I hated that my boyfriend and I were on a rough patch almost every single day. I hated my weight. I hated how I looked. Most of all, I hated that I felt like I was not enough. 

But after consuming all those pills, I realized that I couldn't just end my life right then and there. I had a lot to live for, a lot ahead of me. I couldn't just take my pain and suffering away knowing I would cause everyone else the same feeling. I couldn't just drop everything and give up because my mind was being my worst enemy. I am enough. 

I've never done anything like that before. Never attempted to take my own life or harm myself in any way. I've just felt so miserable for so long that I just needed to stop the pain once and for all. But I've decided that there are better options than just turning to the end. I am making an oath to myself, that I will keep pushing no matter what. I will be strong. I will do whatever it takes to be healthier again. I will push myself in school, in life, at the gym, wherever and whatever.

I just want to be able to feel happy again and not so damn miserable all the time. I will try and get with a therapist and try and work things out and turn things around for my life. I know damn well my ancestors and my passed loved ones would not be proud of me doing something so rash to myself. I just know from here on out, I will keep pushing. I will move forward with my life.

Nothing was keeping me alive.
When I have those suicidal tendencies, important things fade away gradually.
Goals/dreams, passions, studies, work, family/friends.
Slowly, through the years, goals and dreams went away, studies... work...

And three days ago, not even my close ones were a reason to keep me alive.
Why stay alive, when anyways... after a couple of months of crying, I would be lost and forgotten again? 
I’m just another human being...

Why keep on living, when all I go through is suffering? Why not take a look at the void? Contemplate it? Taste it?

That’s what I was thinking, looking at the ceiling from my bathroom floor. 
I felt numb. 
I have been feeling numb for days. But this time, it was different.
I didn’t care anymore.
Nothing mattered to me anymore. 
My parents were gone on a vacation, I wasn’t seeing my friends since a certain time, now. My best friend would text me everyday, but... 
...I just wanted to matter to someone.
I was ready to kill myself. 

But I didn’t. I cried, instead. For what felt like hours. I was in so much pain, I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop.
I haven’t cried this much in a long time.
The pain was unbearable...
I prayed for the first time in forever to any God out there that would just stop this pain. And then, I took a bath, and fell asleep.
Almost as if I came out like a new person, I woke up and felt... okay. And... slowly, my brain has been restructuring itself and gave me new feelings, a new breath of life.

I'm just struggling with stupid stuff. I have diagnosed anxiety disorder and depression, woopee, I'm so quirky, right? Anyway, I'm finding it real fucking hard to continue on. I can't even cry anymore at the thought of killing myself. I'd overdose right now if I wasn't so scared of surviving and possibly damaging my body forever. I'm more scared of that than death. I'm a senior in highschool. To put it short, I have a mentally abusive father. My father abandoned me a month ago through a letter and will not respond to me anymore. He has cut off all ties and despite treating me like shit and giving me so much childhood trauma, I still love him and would do a lot just to have him back and know that he loves me again. My grandma also died, and it wasn't her time. It's changed my life a lot and I can barely handle it. I'm handling it by simply living and going through the motions of life every day, since it takes an effort to actually kill yourself—which is where I'm at right now, too fucking depressed to even kill myself. It's dumb. It's stuff that will pass. But I have to go to school every day. I feel numb every day. And the biggest thing? I can't even focus on myself without having to worry about my best friend. My best friend knows I've been struggling really bad lately, but instead of respecting that, they decide to drop their problems on me as well. I have to live knowing they're cutting themself and I can do absolutely nothing about it–yet I want to so badly. I have to live with their issues before I can even get to mine. When will life let me just focus on myself for once? I feel so selfish wanting that, but I need it so badly. To further this dump of shit that nobody gives a fuck about, I've lived with deep insecurity and I've been basically a loner my whole life. I took care of myself in the years that I needed adult support the most. Most people are friends with me because I benefit them in some way; I always offer help and I never fucking leave.

Thanks in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an idiot, I guess. I&amp;#39;m just struggling with stupid stuff. I have diagnosed anxiety disorder and depression, woopee, I&amp;#39;m so quirky, right? Anyway, I&amp;#39;m finding it real fucking hard to continue on. I can&amp;#39;t even cry anymore at the thought of killing myself. I&amp;#39;d overdose right now if I wasn&amp;#39;t so scared of surviving and possibly damaging my body forever. I&amp;#39;m more scared of that than death. I&amp;#39;m a senior in highschool. To put it short, I have a mentally abusive father. My father abandoned me a month ago through a letter and will not respond to me anymore. He has cut off all ties and despite treating me like shit and giving me so much childhood trauma, I still love him and would do a lot just to have him back and know that he loves me again. My grandma also died, and it wasn&amp;#39;t her time. It&amp;#39;s changed my life a lot and I can barely handle it. I&amp;#39;m handling it by simply living and going through the motions of life every day, since it takes an effort to actually kill yourself—which is where I&amp;#39;m at right now, too fucking depressed to even kill myself. It&amp;#39;s dumb. It&amp;#39;s stuff that will pass. But I have to go to school every day. I feel numb every day. And the biggest thing? I can&amp;#39;t even focus on myself without having to worry about my best friend. My best friend knows I&amp;#39;ve been struggling really bad lately, but instead of respecting that, they decide to drop their problems on me as well. I have to live knowing they&amp;#39;re cutting themself and I can do absolutely nothing about it–yet I want to so badly. I have to live with their issues before I can even get to mine. When will life let me just focus on myself for once? I feel so selfish wanting that, but I need it so badly. To further this dump of shit that nobody gives a fuck about, I&amp;#39;ve lived with deep insecurity and I&amp;#39;ve been basically a loner my whole life. I took care of myself in the years that I needed adult support the most. Most people are friends with me because I benefit them in some way; I always offer help and I never fucking leave.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m six months, I’m in an entirely different place — so much so, I FORGOT I was contemplating ending my life just a few short months ago.  Since I made that post, I’m not only doing much better and I’m much happier, I’m THRIVING.  I have managed to save almost 10k that I’ll be using toward personal investments to better my life.  I’m no longer with this man and in many ways, I’m doing much better than him.  Not that I wish negative things on him despite how he’s treated me, but it’s worth mentioning.  

I say this to say HOLD THE FUCK ON.  Please don’t end your life when things are at their darkest.  That’s the universe FORCING YOU TO FIGHT because what’s on the other side of the upward battle is a newer, stronger model of your former self.  A newer, better you with FORTITUDE.  A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH.  A STRONGER MENTALITY.  You can create POSITIVE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN YOUR LIFE when you fight for them, especially when things look bleak.  

You have to FIGHT to live your best life.  Hold on and FIGHT for what you want to change in your life!  I KNOW IT SOUNDS HARD, BUT THATS THE POINT.  I KNOW IT SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE.  BUT ITS NOT.   Fight for your life, fight for your passions, fight to see another day to fulfill your greatest desires because you fucking deserve it and don’t let anyone or anything ever convince you otherwise!  

I know everyone’s fight is different!  Mine may seem insignificant in comparison to yours and that’s fair!  I’ve been suicidal before, been in the hospital, been on meds, had the note written you name it.  This time was different; I felt like I had NOTHING LEFT in this world.  But this time I superseded my self limiting beliefs and I swear to you I’m in an amazing place right now mentally, emotionally, and physically.  So much can change in 6 months...please fight to see your new story!

I don’t know you but I love you and I wish you an abundance of everlasting joy, a wealth of positivity and the fortitude to see towards tomorrow and create your happiest reality!  I mean it I love you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bpbvfo/considering_an_overdose/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf""&gt;SIX MONTHS AGO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been depressed for over two years and honestly, it’s just been a downhill spiral. These days it’s just so much worse. I don’t feel able to go to school, I just want to leave everyone in my life because they make me feel so broken. I don’t feel enjoyment in things anymore and sure I have my good days or my good moments but they’re so fleeting in comparison to what feels like this eternal sadness and numbness. 

My mock GCSEs are soon (incredible important exams for 16 year olds in the UK) and I can’t do this. I’m going to disappoint everyone, particularly myself because I just can’t work. I can barely pay attention in class and not at all al home , not even including my physical condition which makes work hard. I’ve always been an A grade student (hence the u/ lol) but now I’m just slipping and others are beginning to notice. 

I don’t want to die; it hurts. But honestly I’m not sure I have much reason to life anymore. I’ve got a few reasons so far: 
1) to get more piercings
2) to study photography at A-Level (post-16 education )
3) to own more plants. 

But those reasons are so flimsy and I can dismiss them so easily. 
1) it won’t fix how much I hate my appearance and will just make more people judge me / ostracise me from my peers further 
2) that’s if I can pass my GCSEs and even then, I’ll probably fail that A-Level and hate myself
3) I kill all my plants ; I’m awful at looking after them no matter how hard I try. 

See? Which side is more convincing. 

Sure I suppose there’s my friends and family but really? I have two friends who I can barely talk too because I know that my ,, mental things,, are just a giant burden on them and will ruin the relationships. My family, I don’t care about them much. My parents know I’m like this and you know what? They’ve forced me to two doctors appointments about self harm and they’ve never even acknowledged that it’s a thing. They speak in awkward euphemisms and don’t want me to speak about my mental health too loud because it’s shameful. 

I’ve got my plan. I don’t have a date in mind or a means quite yet but you know; I’m close. I’m so close and I don’t want to be. So I guess that’s why I’m socially stabbing myself and spilling my guts to strangers. I don’t want to die but I can’t cope anymore.

But my body is 23 and everyone expects me to behave like young guy chasing shallow dreams. WTF is this life???&lt;/p&gt;

First time posting here. First time telling random strangers (except besides calling the Suicide Hotline).

Lately I have been feeling extremely alone. I have been feeling like my life is just spiraling. Roll back a year ago.. I had a dream job. Maybe not the best in terms of work but great hours, excellent pay, excellent benefits, amazing coworkers. I got laid off due to budget cuts. I struggled for months getting by on what I had saved up. I got a new job (finally) though now several months ago which required me to move.. I hate the hours, the people, the work, the micromanaging. I hated it.

Throughout the course of this time, I have had medical issues. I have lost my hearing in my left ear. I experience episodes of nausea, vertigo, at least every couple days if not every day. I went to the doctor and after tests, I find I have an autoimmune disease. Just suddenly. No cause. No reason. My body is literally hurting itself already. Killing my hearing. Damaging my nerves. Causing me to go through hell each day. Medication won't help. Nothing helps. I can't stop it. Worst part is.. It's going to get worse. I'm going to lose the other ear. My nerves will get worse.

Then... My significant other of 8 years... 3 months ago.. Cheated on me. In our house. In our bed. I broke down crying. I cut myself that night (an old habit from several years back). I hit the bottle. I wanted to end it all. I called the suicide hotline and was talked out of it. I have tried to live my life. Not a day has gone by since those 3 months I haven't not cried. I feel like everything is being torn from me. My health. My love. My motivation to move forward.

I can't even drink alcohol anymore to numb the pain. I can't do drugs. I can't do anything. Anything I've tried, it has worsened my condition and I get more deaf permanently. The doctor already warned me of a list of things that would worsen it but i just felt so alone. I needed comfort. All my friends are out of touch or out of town since I moved. I know no one here.

I tried within the last month to start dating again. To find an ounce of happiness and comfort in my life. It's only made things worse. To see how little people are interested in me. They like my appearance and profile but once we chat, interest is gone and it's just.. I can't help but think what's wrong with me. Is that why I'm alone? Is that why I was cheated on? Because I'm not good enough? Why I was laid off. Why my body and mind is destroying itself?

I have tried talking to people I know. It gets no where. No one understands. They think I'm being dramatic. That time will heal all wounds. I just... Don't try to talk to them anymore. I don't have anyone to talk to anymore. I've tried..

This last 2 weeks. I felt so shitty. I just... Grabbed bleach and drank it. The taste was horrid and I threw up and puked so much. But I didn't drink much because it felt so terrible. I just laid on the ground alone next to my own puke. I've thought about driving off the road on the mountainside. Every day now I'm thinking of killing myself. I don't want this pain anymore. My chest, my brain, my everything aches.

The ONLY thing stopping me right now... Is my cats. I am not scared of death. I am not scared of the pain or the method. I'm scared of dying and having no one to take care of them. No one to love them. Knowing that they'll die without me. I don't know what to do with this pain anymore. I hate my feelings, my emotions, my own body hates itself too. I just..i feel like my life has spiraled out of control and it's like someone is out to get me. There's no friends around me. No one to understand. No one who gives a damn. I'm tired of putting on a smile every day at work. Putting on a smile while I go get food at the store. I've lost 15 pounds in the last 2 months because I barely eat. It's a chore. I am so tired of this life right now and I don't see it every getting better.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway for obvious reasons..&lt;/p&gt;

Loneliness is a miserable state of being; it damages, corrupts, and desensitized 
one’s mind. It is a piercing sensation that sometimes becomes unbearable and fills one with irrational anger, and hatred towards oneself, others, and life itself. When one does not have someone to talk to, someone that can provide emotional support both in good and bad times, someone that can treat and value you like a normal human being, someone that can treat you with respect and see beyond a superficial physicality, someone that can make you feel normal, or someone that can make you feel loved and appreciated, it wrecks and shatters one’s heart. Loneliness has ruined my life. I have been socially rejected by every single group that I have attempted to join, I have been ridiculed for my physical appearance, and the only time that someone approached me involved a utilitarian relationship. There are several reasons for which those events might have occurred, but that is something that I will address later on. The main purpose of this manifesto consists of expounding the causes and reasons for which I became the person that I am now. I did not want to become this person, but life and, partly, my own decisions shaped me into this irremediable predicament. Loneliness is not the only topic that I will discuss in this manifesto. I will also touch on a plethora of things that I have always wanted to express, but, as I stated before, fear and an irrational inability to control my mind prevented me from doing it before. This manifesto is written for the only person that has always been there for me. This manifesto is for my only friend, myself.

The most suitable place to start, I consider, is in my early life. I was born in the year ---- in a South American country. My early life could be defined as one of the best periods of my life, I did not have to worry about much. I was surrounded by a loving family, but I was not really aware of the circumstances that would permeate the rest of my life. Even though my family was caring and provided me with unconditional love, I still missed one thing, a father. I have never seen my father, but I know and hope that one day I will meet him. My father was killed two months before my mother gave birth. My country of origin, at the time, was plagued with high-criminality rates, and he was one of the victims. My mother suffered a lot, and, based on numerous of her accounts, she was extremely depressed. I can only imagine being about to give birth and having to attend the funeral of your husband and soon-to-be father, it must be devastating. This might be one of the reasons for which my mind is so weak. I do not know if depression and other mental disorders can be genetically transmitted, but that can be a possibility.

Loneliness is a miserable state of being; it damages, corrupts, and desensitized 
one’s mind. It is a piercing sensation that sometimes becomes unbearable and fills one with irrational anger, and hatred towards oneself, others, and life itself. When one does not have someone to talk to, someone that can provide emotional support both in good and bad times, someone that can treat and value you like a normal human being, someone that can treat you with respect and see beyond a superficial physicality, someone that can make you feel normal, or someone that can make you feel loved and appreciated, it wrecks and shatters one’s heart. Loneliness has ruined my life. I have been socially rejected by every single group that I have attempted to join, I have been ridiculed for my physical appearance, and the only time that someone approached me involved a utilitarian relationship. There are several reasons for which those events might have occurred, but that is something that I will address later on. The main purpose of this manifesto consists of expounding the causes and reasons for which I became the person that I am now. I did not want to become this person, but life and, partly, my own decisions shaped me into this irremediable predicament. Loneliness is not the only topic that I will discuss in this manifesto. I will also touch on a plethora of things that I have always wanted to express, but, as I stated before, fear and an irrational inability to control my mind prevented me from doing it before. This manifesto is written for the only person that has always been there for me. This manifesto is for my only friend, myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most suitable place to start, I consider, is in my early life. I was born in the year ---- in a South American country. My early life could be defined as one of the best periods of my life, I did not have to worry about much. I was surrounded by a loving family, but I was not really aware of the circumstances that would permeate the rest of my life. Even though my family was caring and provided me with unconditional love, I still missed one thing, a father. I have never seen my father, but I know and hope that one day I will meet him. My father was killed two months before my mother gave birth. My country of origin, at the time, was plagued with high-criminality rates, and he was one of the victims. My mother suffered a lot, and, based on numerous of her accounts, she was extremely depressed. I can only imagine being about to give birth and having to attend the funeral of your husband and soon-to-be father, it must be devastating. This might be one of the reasons for which my mind is so weak. I do not know if depression and other mental disorders can be genetically transmitted, but that can be a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***I will continue the writing of my manifesto in this post and I will update it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

Both emotionally and physically.

From when I was a kid up to adolescence, my mom abused me a lot. She'd give me beatings at least once a week, but usually 3 or more times a week. I was the middle child and it seemed like I got the worst of it. My siblings didn't seem to get beatings much, if at all. She didn't leave much physical permanent damage, but the emotional scars cut very deep. I'm still effected by it today. She tried making amends, but I never let her, and then she died when I was 18.

My dad got custody of me and my brother when I got to adolescence. I was almost a teenager, and my dad was a drunk. He'd come home from work every day at 7:00 o'clock and go in to his room and be by himself. He neglected us most days. One day, when he was angry, he didn't go in to his room. He had a bad day at work apparently, I don't really remember all the details. I must've made him angry because he picked me up by the neck and slammed me against a wall, choking me. My mind blocked that out for years, but my brother told me about it and my dad confessed to it in therapy after he started cleaning up his act. That was the only time he abused me. That's where my injury came from.

Every day I'm in physical pain, ever since I was a young teen. I wake up most nights because I hurt so much. The pain starts at my neck and goes all the way down my shoulder to the middle of my arm. I don't even have much physical feeling there on the surface of where my shoulder blade is (nerve damage?), but underneath hurts non-stop. No medicine I've been prescribed helps, not even Vicodin. I'm always in pain. I even had depersonalization for years, but I visited a chriopractor who adjusted my neck. I don't really care if people believe it, but the chiro snapped my neck and my vision instantly went from 2D with no depth perception to 3D. It made me cry, but I'm still in pain. I've got an MRI I need to schedule, but I know even if I have surgery I'll never be 100%. That scar will always be there.

I'm a young adult right now who dropped out of high school because I was all messed up on a myriad of medication and I was bullied daily. I don't even see a future for myself. I'm always in physical and emotional pain, I've got a shitty sales job where I work my ass off, and I don't even get paid part time wages for full time work because it's commission based. I make $200 a week if I'm lucky.

I'm surprised I've made it this far. I've been suicidal since I was 14 and now I'm 21. That's a third of my life. I still don't want to exist anymore, but every time I get close to killing myself I think about what my friends and family would go through if I did it. My dad cares about me a lot now, but I don't think he completely understands. I think he's mainly why I'm still here. I want to try to make something of myself so I can make my dad happy, but he's so old now and I fail too much in life. I don't think he'll live long enough to see me get married or become successful, God willing those two things happen. I seriously doubt it.

 Had a couple heartbreaks that took me years to get over. Been in multiple bad accidents.

I came home from a weekend out of town and I had a few beer cans in the back of my truck so my stepfather fired me and kicked me out in the same day. Found a girl who was helpless with an infant who needed to be saved lol (cant even save myself). 7 years together and I realized I married my mother pretty much (just an ignorant fool who has no life experience and would rather act like they know it all)

 We've been homeless 3 times, ive been homeless 4 times. I started doing repairs and remodels the last time we were homeless, made about $500k, bought a 2 story house, new cars, toys. Woke up one day and couldnt go to work, started off missing about 2 days a week and ended up not going to work at all and ran through my savings (this was almost 2 yrs ago). I still am not better, i went from making $3-500/day to working for a friend for $120/day just to get by.

Most of my life is a blur except for bits and pieces of bad stuff. Im pretty much broke now. It really fucked me up when I realized how stupid and selfish my wife really was. We have a 2yo son together now.

 I feel like I got myself into a situation that ill never be happy in and i feel like if I leave the kids will pay the price and today the thought of suicide crossed my mind again. Ive got a constant anxious/panic feeling in my chest that builds up after days or weeks of no feelings or happiness that makes me want to do something drastic just to feel something. Ive had to cut off all contact with my toxic cult family members and really have nowhere to turn.

Sex talk. So, if you're uncomfortable turn away now. 

As if things couldn't have gotten worse... I already had depression, and it's still here so I don't know what the fuck the antis were supposed to be doing. If anything, because of an indirect consequences of them, I'm way closer to suicide than when I started them.

After I got off of them, suddenly it's like everything sexually about me crashed into a brick wall and was pronounced dead at the scene. At first I figured it was my normal burn out of just having too much too quickly and my body and brain was getting numb and bored to the same stuff happening over and over again. So, I took a break. It happens all the time, and I can come back within like a week or two and be better than ever. 

But, this time, I never got better. I took an entire month off of any sexual activity. Maybe two. And, nothing. It's been close to five months since I've felt anything at all, and five months just so happens to be how long ago I stopped taking SSRIs and antidepressants in general. Even when I was on my antis, any attempt at getting off was almost always shut down, but there were a few moments in there where things were mediocre. This past year and a half, has been an absolute downfall for my sexuality. I feel so shitty. I can't get aroused, can't get wet, can't get turned on, can't orgasm. Basically no fucking libido whatsoever. 

And what's crazy is that up before this, I had no issue with any sort of libido. It was up a fuckin' wall, in fact. Has been for the last four years thanks to those 'raging angsty teenager hormones' (Yes, I am a teenager, and no, that does not make me too young to talk about this. My sex life is as important and as valid as yours. I'm not a little kid). Even during the intense parts of my depression (which is known to mess with you sexually), I never had issues. 

I was fine today, until I came to the realisation that this is beyond the realms of normal, even for SSRIs. I've only ever read about how _while_ taking SSRIs it can affect your sex life. And a little bit after taking them too, like a few days or weeks.

Not five months. That's too long. Google led me to PSSD, which I know, I know, ""doNt gOoGlE yOuR symPtoMs"", but, it matches what I've been going through perfectly. Too perfectly, unfortunately. But, at least I've found a name for it.

PSSD seems to be really fucking fluid with how long it can last for people, but from what I can tell, it seems to last on the longer side for most people, and a lot are probably gonna have it forever without some intense medication or changes in their lives. There's no known cure. It feels like depression, but for my vagina rather than my brain. It's absolutely awful. 

And, I've seem to have gotten the lucky side of it. Other people can apparently experience straight up pain, tingling, and numbness (like literal numbness, not just the figurative word). 

I'm frustrated beyond words. Not to mention, I was put on these when I was a kid, who didn't understand there were side effects to it, or any medication for that matter. But especially not sexual ones that I'd feel and regret down the road. I had basically no say in this, and the few that I did have, I was too ignorant to make a half decent judgement.

There's no way I'm going on for the rest of my life like this. No fucking way. I can hardly stomach just two and a half more years of this, when I'll finally be an adult and be able to be taken seriously and can speak to a professional about it. I've lived 15 and 1/2 years, just 15, and a big portion of it already feels ruined. Sure, yeah. I'll have a job. Friends. Maybe a partner. Maybe somehow a kid or two. But, there's still a whole big chunk of it taken out by probably never being able to have sex (or even get to try it for that matter) or ever being able to masturbate again. Not to mention throw all of the other stuff I'm already depressed about. 

Before I get ""those"" kinds of comments from people, I know I'm still a teen and sex shouldn't necessarily be the first thing on my mind, but my biggest issue is more of if this is a permanent thing.

I’ve always kept up the facade of someone who’s always happy, and my gf has a history of self harm and depression so I’ve tried to always be there for her, act happy and not sad and so far throughout our relationship she hasn’t done anything, but this whole situation made me realize something.

I'm transgender. Do i want to be? Fuck no i don't, but if i try to stop then i cry like a bitch.

I'm gay. Do i want to be? No, cause 1) no one around is gay. 2) anyone who is wouldn't date a trans person.

I'm fat. Do i want to be? Even though i hardly eat, i still gain weight.

I barely have any friends. At the moment i only have probably two. I love them, but i know they'll leave too. And after they leave, i'll have nothing but my dog, and she's reaching her age. 

I fucking hate life. I know i'd be better off dead and if i killed myself now, no one could care less.

No one fucking loves me and it's reasonable that they don't. I'm a piece of shit. My emotions are everywhere, i'm never happy, i fucking burned myself to feel something. 

I honestly just wanna slam my head into a wall until i go fucking brain dead because that would be better than living in this hell anymore. I wanna fucking blow my brains out and hopefully someone will notice before i rot and be an even more disgusting burden than i already am.

I deserve to fucking die. I want to kill myself. 

""Why won't someone love me?"" I ask myself daily, but its immediately always answered by myself. Its's because i'm like this; a fucking unstable, suicidal cunt-faggot who just wants to get fucked before he offs himself so he at least won't die a virgin, but it's not like it matters cause i'll get attached, fall in love, then get rejected and i'll go back to being the fucking shut in that i am and i'll  cry myself to sleep like i've done every night since i became a cynical piece of human trash. 

I just want to be loved. All i want is a meaningful hug. That'd be nice, but it's never meaningful, not even from my parents. I know i'm unwanted and that everyone would benefit from my death. I wish i knew what it felt like to be loved.

God, i sound like an incel. I might as well fucking kill myself just for that.

I hate this. I want to die. Fuck it all. No one will ever love me.

&gt; Hello family, friends, and colleagues.

&gt; I would like to let you know I’ve decided to to ensure that I don’t hurt anyone ever again.

&gt; I am just so sorry for this. It’s not my first choice, and I assure you it didn’t come easily.
I know you all love me, and I love you all too. But this pain and depression is too much. I’m turning into a seriously bad person. I cause damage every day. I cannot stop hurting people. 

&gt; For the past 3 years I’ve been on welfare; wasting approximately $36000 of other hard working people’s money. It’s time to stop the waste. It’s time to cut off the damaged limb. 

&gt; Yes I’ve made genuine efforts to study, and to work, yet my inability to remain mentally stable has robbed me of my study opportunities, and I still cannot find employment. I’ve tried and tried and tried. There is still no work available. I had 7 job interviews in the past 5 months. There is always a better candidate. I understand there is no place for me.

&gt; Throughout all of this, I have managed to manipulate my way into your social circle, I have accidentally hurt all of you just by existing. 


&gt; I tried to ask the psychiatrist but as I understand it, BPD means there is no recovery, no capacity to stop hurting people. I want to live, but I know deep down that unless I have the courage to make this step I’ll just end up hurting more people on the way.

We had issues with a few apartments, ended up moving in with a client who had a room for rent and needed overnight care. After he demanded more and more, we had to move in with my mom. That's where we've been for the past 2 years.

Originally she was working a standard job, as was I, and we were doing great. We were helping my mom fix up her place and getting money saved. Slowly her work started to dry up, though, and they weren't trying to keep her up on hours. On top of that, they were hiring brand new people with no experience at higher rates than her, and she had a decade of experience.

She decided to start her own business after the company decided to drop a few of the clients she was working with as they were getting out of a certain area. She picked up a few, and the income was okay to start. She started looking at the future and expanding, but unfortunately that didn't happen. 2 years later, she's looking at downsizing even more, and likely will be getting out of the business entirely.

So for 2 years I paid all of our bills, other than a few. I didn't care, it was about letting her have her dream. I did it for her. I even went out of my way to try to help her with everything that I could. 

The bombshell came when she started saying she wanted to leave, and it might be without me. She had always wanted to leave the state, but this was somewhat sudden. She eventually told me the only thing holding her back from leaving has been that she's worried about me killing myself.

This has sent me into a downward spiral. I'm breaking down constantly. I entertain the thought of suicide constantly. I genuinely keep wondering why I haven't done it yet, but I've been here a lot over the years, and it just never happens.

I'll have been married to her for 6 years here soon, and we've known each other far longer. I can't imagine life without her. I don't know that I'd want that life. I just keep telling myself that she will come around. I want her to tell me we can still be together. I teally want a hug and a kiss and to be told it will all be okay. But I won't get that.

Working in the only variety stock retail store of a town of a couple thousand and the go to for a few nearby townships is stressful enough as it is. Especially when working for a corporation that scoffs at the idea of giving us more hours to even possibly schedule more than 2 people working on a shift, let alone to hire anymore than we have on staff. So having to deal with the constant stress of having to either keep a store tidy where most customers don't care about if they smash into things and knock them over or throw messes everywhere, dealing with shits who like to steal or break things and not bother telling us and us getting scolded by customers who find shit like glass or spills and how we don't bother to care about hazards in the store when both of us can be struggling to keep a bustling line down and can't spare the moment to go clean it that instant. Or getting reamed for even trying to begin cleaning it up and how dare we let the line back up so badly and how terrible we are at running a store when we're struggling to handle times (sometimes the span of a couple of hours) where 20-40 people are shopping and trying to check out in a constant flow. 

God forbid I try to go on the town's community page to ask people to treat stores nicely and be less harassing to employees (without even naming the store) and maybe to not let kids just break things because they want to play around and create a risk by their breaking something that leads to a danger to others or the playing itself being dangerous. Cause how dare we tell children to not tear through the store at full speed without parents snipping at us to mind our own business cause who cares if the kids might slam into something and hurt themselves (and them probably trying to set us up to be at fault) or hit into the many elderly that come in and probably plan to just shove the injury off to us to take care of and possibly pay for because it's not hard for a lot of elderly to get hurt.

Oh no. Can't bring that up so a discussion on how customers can be more mindful of what the workers have to deal with so they're not busy having to try and clean up a mess of a store while being screamed at to open a register because, surprise, when you're hardcore focusing on trying to tidy up as fast as possible you aren't paying full attention to the line.

Nope. Have to get just a few people trying to spin it into drama and cause your family to start messaging you to delete the post or risk being fired (even though corporate can't see things in a closed FB group but I guess insinuating that enough people in town will just report it to get me in trouble). So whatever. Delete the post. Delete my FB. Because I guess I'm just supposed to be a quiet little doll who's just allowed to be beaten and battered by a company that expects you to be able to do the work of 2-4 people at times (which is getting to that point because holidays and inventory coming up) but customers also expecting you to keep the store super neat and tidy and cash them out and show them to where everything is and to sweep and mop up and to get stock out because they're annoyed at the fact the thing they wanted isn't in stock or being bitchy because sorry that we don't have 30 coolers in the back with all this extra stock of stuff that sells out fast and yup it's my fault that I can't just make our vendors deliver every day to make sure the exact thing you want is always here for you to buy.

Everyone just wants me just spouting crap like ""oh just please be nice to retail workers, that'd be swell"" so everyone can nod and agree and pat their back all the while acting the same abusive way towards us because the actual issues in question aren't being addressed. Because it's just so much nicer to remain ignorant to what's going on so they can be more in peace to scream and yell at us for things that we can't fix on our level. Because trying to push workers to go at a 130% for weeks and months at a time isn't damaging to the body at all. Because being so crass to things you'd rather remain ignorant to so you have someone to yell at isn't damaging mentally.

But ""that's just how adult life is"" or ""can't make corporate angry"" because fuck trying to maybe get a town to converse with a corporation to maybe install even smaller changes that could just be slightly beneficial. Fuck I'd take even a 3% increase be it just getting 20 extra hours to lessen the stress when we're getting our asses utterly slammed with customers. Hell I'd even just take them taking extra care to look into our store and seeing that we're a fucking smaller model of the one we're set up to be as and are missing nearly 16 feet of shelving sections that we still treated like we have, to have less stock for end caps given because so many of ours have changed to permanent ones that everything they sent just sits in the back that takes up so much room that fucking adds up over time when they do it with every end cap that we can't have. Making it that much harder to fit stock from truck in the back and being yelled at because we have shipping racks on the floor because there's no where else and we can't get the hours to have anyone else come in or stay longer to work it so there's not at much.

And fuck it's all I can do to just not be tempted to just slit my throat or down a bottle of pills because it's not like I can leave jobs either without a car and no other jobs are available because slowly dying town so just stuck taking this abuse and expected to just deal with it cause fuck if anyone will actually listen enough to actually understand and not give half assed retorts in response.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already expect this to be long so if you&amp;#39;re not here for that then can&amp;#39;t be helped I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone just wants me just spouting crap like &amp;quot;oh just please be nice to retail workers, that&amp;#39;d be swell&amp;quot; so everyone can nod and agree and pat their back all the while acting the same abusive way towards us because the actual issues in question aren&amp;#39;t being addressed. Because it&amp;#39;s just so much nicer to remain ignorant to what&amp;#39;s going on so they can be more in peace to scream and yell at us for things that we can&amp;#39;t fix on our level. Because trying to push workers to go at a 130% for weeks and months at a time isn&amp;#39;t damaging to the body at all. Because being so crass to things you&amp;#39;d rather remain ignorant to so you have someone to yell at isn&amp;#39;t damaging mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s just how adult life is&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t make corporate angry&amp;quot; because fuck trying to maybe get a town to converse with a corporation to maybe install even smaller changes that could just be slightly beneficial. Fuck I&amp;#39;d take even a 3% increase be it just getting 20 extra hours to lessen the stress when we&amp;#39;re getting our asses utterly slammed with customers. Hell I&amp;#39;d even just take them taking extra care to look into our store and seeing that we&amp;#39;re a fucking smaller model of the one we&amp;#39;re set up to be as and are missing nearly 16 feet of shelving sections that we still treated like we have, to have less stock for end caps given because so many of ours have changed to permanent ones that everything they sent just sits in the back that takes up so much room that fucking adds up over time when they do it with every end cap that we can&amp;#39;t have. Making it that much harder to fit stock from truck in the back and being yelled at because we have shipping racks on the floor because there&amp;#39;s no where else and we can&amp;#39;t get the hours to have anyone else come in or stay longer to work it so there&amp;#39;s not at much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And fuck it&amp;#39;s all I can do to just not be tempted to just slit my throat or down a bottle of pills because it&amp;#39;s not like I can leave jobs either without a car and no other jobs are available because slowly dying town so just stuck taking this abuse and expected to just deal with it cause fuck if anyone will actually listen enough to actually understand and not give half assed retorts in response.&lt;/p&gt;

 I want to kill myself. Life has become too painful to bear.

I am a failure. I am 33 years old with nothing of any value. I have no boyfriend. I have no job. I have no savings. I live with my parents. I have no close friends.

There was a time where I was more optimistic. I was heading for a bright career as a university lecturer, I had a long term partner and I had ambition.

However, two years ago I became depressed – I ended my 12 year relationship with my partner and I quit my job, as my mental health was impacting upon my ability to teach. Since then, I have been unable to hold down a job without regressing back to depression. My parents are at their wits end with my lack of motivation and they have no understanding of how depression works. 

I just exist by eating, sleeping, job hunting (jobs that I am not qualified or experienced enough for) and watching Youtube. I do not have the money for a total career change – I cannot get funding for a 2nd degree, so I feel helpless and lost, as every possible way out has an obstacle.

I want to die but I am not brave enough to attempt suicide again, as I failed last time and surviving only made my life worse. Does anybody else feel like this?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to kill myself. Life has become too painful to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

I am mainly just writing this to rant, so I don't expect anyone to actually read this, at least in its entirety. I wanted it to be somewhat chronological, but that's not how the brain works, so bare with me if some pieces don't flow well. 

TL;DR: despite trying to live to the best of my abilities, it's always a fruitless battle. 

Ever since I was in middle school, I've had suicidal ideation, but never to the point where it would manifest itself into action. It was more like I was obsessed with the idea of not existing, but never really knew why. And I felt I had an okay childhood, with a bit of ups and downs. I had a mother who loved me, nice siblings, got to see my dad every other weekend, had a couple of dogs and other pets, etc... Some of the more subtle things that I didn't know affected me as a kid was living below the poverty line, having separated parents (with 8 siblings none of which shared both of parents with me, only either from my mom or dad), living in a small city while black, being bullied for my being ""too black for the white kids and too 'white' for the black kids"", etc... Which I never thought was that bad.

I've always been a good student and a good kid. I've never made my parents terribly upset (except for a time where I tried to ""save"" my older brother from school when I was 3 because he didn't come home at the normal time a.k.a. when the Dora the Explorer theme song came on). I've consistently gotten good grades and have been praised at school. I did a lot of sports, played a few instruments, and entered art shows. I was my parents model child and tried to live in their best image. 

Then, I felt as though I've had a never ending streak of bad luck. 

When I was 12, I was raped by a family friend who was 15 in my house, and only found out because I kept feeling weird when I woke up in the morning, in a different room nonetheless. Because I had a bad feeling, I set up the old smart phone that I had in my room as a camera when I slept, and, to spare details, caught him in the act. 

When I was 14, my mother passed away due to cancer, and I had to move in with my father, who I then discovered was pretty abusive, both physically and mentally. He would constantly beat me to the point that my glasses would break, or I'd have broken blood vessels in my eyes. He made it seem like it was normal, and not a big deal, and constantly manipulated me. At that time I also became sort of an ""only child"" since all of my dad's kids have left the house and moved to another city, and my mother's kids were all moved out as well. As the youngest, I was the only one left. He would drink a lot and come home and get angry that there was a cup left in the dish basin and hit me. Ground me for no reason, etc... A school counselor realized that I wasn't doing okay and would come to school with no glasses or blood in my eyes, and called CYS. That wasn't until I was already 17 though, and they apparently didn't want to help me because I was too old, and I didn't have enough other bruises.

When I was college bound, my father lightened up, and life seemed okay again. I ended up getting accepted into a great university to study engineering, and maintained a good GPA and participated in a lot of extracurricular activities. 

During my freshman year, I had a bit of ups and downs in terms of mood. Eventually, I tried to commit suicide after of psychosis episode in the second semester, and had to be sent the the hospital for a few days. This caused my depression to get worse, and I felt traumatized by the experience. While at the hospital, I've missed exams and my grades suffered, causing me to spiral more into depression. Eventually, after using the university's psychological services, I've began to recover, and started doing well in school again. 

Then, right at the beginning of my sophomore year, I got into a really bad car accident. Long story short, my (dad's) car lost control while I was driving, crossed the highway median, and slid into the opposing traffic, crashing into another car. The other person didn't survive. I was devastated. I couldn't believe that this had happened, and for the next few months, I genuinely wished that somehow I could be replaced with him. I wanted to be dead instead. I didn't want an innocent life to be gone, and I didn't/don't feel I deserve to be alive instead. I've went to therapy and started taking depression medication, because I could barely maintain the will to live. I can still even barely cope with this.

Five months later, I got a call from a detective, saying the state wanted to charge me with vehicular homicide. Although most car accidents that end up in death don't usually result in a vehicular homicide charge unless drugs and/or alcohol were used, the detective said I was going 84 in a 55 due to an electronic data recorder in my car. This made me feel hopeless, and I was certain my life was over.

But I was very wary of the detective - maybe because of the already tense relationship between law enforcement and the black community, or maybe because I was certain that my very tiny, 20 year old car couldn't even go 84 mph - and did some research. I eventually came to learn that the detective never actually did an accident reconstruction, and that the data he receive was flawed. A lawyer took my case pro bono, and helped me hire and actual reconstructionist, who proved that it was scientifically impossible for me to have been going that speed, and even impossible to be going anything over ~70 if that. Although this had made me hopeful, the feeling of being slandered by law enforcement (more than just the speed he alleged), the media, and the public hurt me. The case is still ongoing, and although everyone around me feels confident, I feel empty and hopeless.

Not to mention that I'm still torn of the loss of life that resulted from the accident. On one hand, I am upset at the detective using false information to try to build a case, but on the other, I'm heartbroken for the man's family, and depressed that his life was lost and not mine. It's nauseating. 

And now, I feel that my life is over. I used to be a good student, a good daughter, a good girlfriend, a good person in general. I was intelligent and ambitious. I wanted to cure cancer so that nobody's else mother would have to pass away like mine. I wanted to donate all of my money to help those in need have a fair opportunity at life. I wanted my family to be proud of me, I wanted to be proud of myself, and I wanted to help make the world better. 

But now I can't. My life is over. Everything that I've ever worked for, fruitless. I'm on my last shred of will to live. There's more parts of me that say there's no point in waiting to end it all, than not. Only human instinct keeps me here. 

But I've never had a chance in the first place. This world is not cut out for people like me anyways. This world is not made for black women who have come from poverty, and I'm constantly punished for trying to change that. I'm rightfully punished for thinking it's not all pointless. Because it all is pointless. 

Thank you for reading if you did.

Edit: for some reason, I also cannot see you comments, but thank you for reading my story.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably going to be pretty long. I am mainly just writing this to rant, so I don&amp;#39;t expect anyone to actually read this, at least in its entirety. I wanted it to be somewhat chronological, but that&amp;#39;s not how the brain works, so bare with me if some pieces don&amp;#39;t flow well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: despite trying to live to the best of my abilities, it&amp;#39;s always a fruitless battle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was in middle school, I&amp;#39;ve had suicidal ideation, but never to the point where it would manifest itself into action. It was more like I was obsessed with the idea of not existing, but never really knew why. And I felt I had an okay childhood, with a bit of ups and downs. I had a mother who loved me, nice siblings, got to see my dad every other weekend, had a couple of dogs and other pets, etc... Some of the more subtle things that I didn&amp;#39;t know affected me as a kid was living below the poverty line, having separated parents (with 8 siblings none of which shared both of parents with me, only either from my mom or dad), living in a small city while black, being bullied for my being &amp;quot;too black for the white kids and too &amp;#39;white&amp;#39; for the black kids&amp;quot;, etc... Which I never thought was that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been a good student and a good kid. I&amp;#39;ve never made my parents terribly upset (except for a time where I tried to &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; my older brother from school when I was 3 because he didn&amp;#39;t come home at the normal time a.k.a. when the Dora the Explorer theme song came on). I&amp;#39;ve consistently gotten good grades and have been praised at school. I did a lot of sports, played a few instruments, and entered art shows. I was my parents model child and tried to live in their best image. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I felt as though I&amp;#39;ve had a never ending streak of bad luck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 12, I was raped by a family friend who was 15 in my house, and only found out because I kept feeling weird when I woke up in the morning, in a different room nonetheless. Because I had a bad feeling, I set up the old smart phone that I had in my room as a camera when I slept, and, to spare details, caught him in the act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 14, my mother passed away due to cancer, and I had to move in with my father, who I then discovered was pretty abusive, both physically and mentally. He would constantly beat me to the point that my glasses would break, or I&amp;#39;d have broken blood vessels in my eyes. He made it seem like it was normal, and not a big deal, and constantly manipulated me. At that time I also became sort of an &amp;quot;only child&amp;quot; since all of my dad&amp;#39;s kids have left the house and moved to another city, and my mother&amp;#39;s kids were all moved out as well. As the youngest, I was the only one left. He would drink a lot and come home and get angry that there was a cup left in the dish basin and hit me. Ground me for no reason, etc... A school counselor realized that I wasn&amp;#39;t doing okay and would come to school with no glasses or blood in my eyes, and called CYS. That wasn&amp;#39;t until I was already 17 though, and they apparently didn&amp;#39;t want to help me because I was too old, and I didn&amp;#39;t have enough other bruises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was college bound, my father lightened up, and life seemed okay again. I ended up getting accepted into a great university to study engineering, and maintained a good GPA and participated in a lot of extracurricular activities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my freshman year, I had a bit of ups and downs in terms of mood. Eventually, I tried to commit suicide after of psychosis episode in the second semester, and had to be sent the the hospital for a few days. This caused my depression to get worse, and I felt traumatized by the experience. While at the hospital, I&amp;#39;ve missed exams and my grades suffered, causing me to spiral more into depression. Eventually, after using the university&amp;#39;s psychological services, I&amp;#39;ve began to recover, and started doing well in school again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, right at the beginning of my sophomore year, I got into a really bad car accident. Long story short, my (dad&amp;#39;s) car lost control while I was driving, crossed the highway median, and slid into the opposing traffic, crashing into another car. The other person didn&amp;#39;t survive. I was devastated. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe that this had happened, and for the next few months, I genuinely wished that somehow I could be replaced with him. I wanted to be dead instead. I didn&amp;#39;t want an innocent life to be gone, and I didn&amp;#39;t/don&amp;#39;t feel I deserve to be alive instead. I&amp;#39;ve went to therapy and started taking depression medication, because I could barely maintain the will to live. I can still even barely cope with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five months later, I got a call from a detective, saying the state wanted to charge me with vehicular homicide. Although most car accidents that end up in death don&amp;#39;t usually result in a vehicular homicide charge unless drugs and/or alcohol were used, the detective said I was going 84 in a 55 due to an electronic data recorder in my car. This made me feel hopeless, and I was certain my life was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was very wary of the detective - maybe because of the already tense relationship between law enforcement and the black community, or maybe because I was certain that my very tiny, 20 year old car couldn&amp;#39;t even go 84 mph - and did some research. I eventually came to learn that the detective never actually did an accident reconstruction, and that the data he receive was flawed. A lawyer took my case pro bono, and helped me hire and actual reconstructionist, who proved that it was scientifically impossible for me to have been going that speed, and even impossible to be going anything over ~70 if that. Although this had made me hopeful, the feeling of being slandered by law enforcement (more than just the speed he alleged), the media, and the public hurt me. The case is still ongoing, and although everyone around me feels confident, I feel empty and hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention that I&amp;#39;m still torn of the loss of life that resulted from the accident. On one hand, I am upset at the detective using false information to try to build a case, but on the other, I&amp;#39;m heartbroken for the man&amp;#39;s family, and depressed that his life was lost and not mine. It&amp;#39;s nauseating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, I feel that my life is over. I used to be a good student, a good daughter, a good girlfriend, a good person in general. I was intelligent and ambitious. I wanted to cure cancer so that nobody&amp;#39;s else mother would have to pass away like mine. I wanted to donate all of my money to help those in need have a fair opportunity at life. I wanted my family to be proud of me, I wanted to be proud of myself, and I wanted to help make the world better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I can&amp;#39;t. My life is over. Everything that I&amp;#39;ve ever worked for, fruitless. I&amp;#39;m on my last shred of will to live. There&amp;#39;s more parts of me that say there&amp;#39;s no point in waiting to end it all, than not. Only human instinct keeps me here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ve never had a chance in the first place. This world is not cut out for people like me anyways. This world is not made for black women who have come from poverty, and I&amp;#39;m constantly punished for trying to change that. I&amp;#39;m rightfully punished for thinking it&amp;#39;s not all pointless. Because it all is pointless. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm fucking tired of life. Anytime I'm not pre-occupied, I'm laying in bed, scrolling endlessly on my phone, or just laying there. Either way, I'm thinking about it.

I have no fucking life anymore. I'm a senior in high school. I don't have a car, I've never had a job, and I don't even have my license because no one in my life will teach me how to drive. At least, those who have cared enough to notice that I don't have these things.

Having no car and no income means no one wants to hang out with me outside of school. All my friends that graduated last year STILL hang out with people they were friends with that are even in the grades below me. But they never text me, or acknowledge that I exist.

I try not to tell my friends what I'm feeling. All my friends go through stuff too, and anytime I start a message talking about it, I end up completely getting rid of it because they don't need to hear me whine about my shitty life when they've got stuff that's probably worse happening.

If i do tell my friends what I'm feeling, it's all the same shit. ""It gets better!"" ""I'm in the same spot, it's gonna be okay!"" ""Just try to be happier!"" And all the ""i love you""s and shit like that.

I'm so fucking tired of being spoonfed the same shit. It's because they KNOW that I'm not gonna do anything. And it's because they KNOW that the quicker they respond, the quicker I'll get off their back because I have that insecurity of knowing that they couldn't care less about anything I feel.

When I made a remark about my suicidal thoughts, my friend threatened to tell my parents. I stopped talking to her about anything like that after that. I don't wanna tell my parents. They aren't gonna fucking care. It's just like everything else I say. My mother will just huff and puff about it and she'll blame it on something completely unrelated. My stepdad doesn't really give two shits.

My real dad is an alcoholic, with no real life to speak of, but allegedly he also speculates that something is mentally wrong with me. I commend him for that, but we've never really had a true relationship or bond, so it's not like anything is going to come out of that, either. I feel so genuinely uncomfortable around him, and nothing gets done if I'm not emotionally involved.

So, yeah. I've got really nothing. I'm too anxious to apply for jobs. My really good friend said that her dad would be able to take me driving, but I hate bothering people when I can help it, because it's just a waste of their time.

It'd be so much easier if I was gone. I wouldn't worry about this shit, and others wouldn't either. I wouldn't have to constantly feel like no one wants me.

I've never self-harmed, but I have thought about it. I've refrained from it because I would hate to have to explain the entirety of my mental health hellpit. That's assuming the person would understand, and not directly report it before hearing me out.

If you asked me why I'm posting this, I can't give you a straight answer. Probably because no one knows me here.

I honestly don't know why I'm complaining, either. Everyone else has problems, too. Way worse than mine. Split custody situations, no parents at all, no friends at all. Those are all way worse than just being washed up at 17. It's not like I don't have friends. But i sure as hell can't indulge in anything, or have any kind of life.

My friend guilt-tripped me for it, too. ""Your parents aren't gonna pay for you forever!"" Yeah, because hopefully I'll be dead before there's anything else for them to pay for.

My sister tries to encourage me, but it's so back-handed. Everyone in my family thinks it's so fucking easy. It's not. I can't work in fast food/a restaurant because my anxiety is too high and I'll just get stressed and cry and then I'll get fired for being an unprofessional little bitch. I could work in retail, but all the retail stores are way too far away from my house to walk. I applied for a night-shift job at the grocery store because I knew that it would be less stressful, but they denied my application. I could probably get an interview if I applied for a daytime job, but there's too many people. Nothing is right for me because I'm a picky piece of shit.

I told my friend I wanted to call a hotline, but I also know how those things work and that's not what I want. I want someone that is in my life to either be truthful and tell me I'm a piece of shit, or abandon me. It's easier that way. At least I'll know it's not a lie.

&lt;p&gt;When I made a remark about my suicidal thoughts, my friend threatened to tell my parents. I stopped talking to her about anything like that after that. I don&amp;#39;t wanna tell my parents. They aren&amp;#39;t gonna fucking care. It&amp;#39;s just like everything else I say. My mother will just huff and puff about it and she&amp;#39;ll blame it on something completely unrelated. My stepdad doesn&amp;#39;t really give two shits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My real dad is an alcoholic, with no real life to speak of, but allegedly he also speculates that something is mentally wrong with me. I commend him for that, but we&amp;#39;ve never really had a true relationship or bond, so it&amp;#39;s not like anything is going to come out of that, either. I feel so genuinely uncomfortable around him, and nothing gets done if I&amp;#39;m not emotionally involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah. I&amp;#39;ve got really nothing. I&amp;#39;m too anxious to apply for jobs. My really good friend said that her dad would be able to take me driving, but I hate bothering people when I can help it, because it&amp;#39;s just a waste of their time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;d be so much easier if I was gone. I wouldn&amp;#39;t worry about this shit, and others wouldn&amp;#39;t either. I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to constantly feel like no one wants me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never self-harmed, but I have thought about it. I&amp;#39;ve refrained from it because I would hate to have to explain the entirety of my mental health hellpit. That&amp;#39;s assuming the person would understand, and not directly report it before hearing me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you asked me why I&amp;#39;m posting this, I can&amp;#39;t give you a straight answer. Probably because no one knows me here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;m complaining, either. Everyone else has problems, too. Way worse than mine. Split custody situations, no parents at all, no friends at all. Those are all way worse than just being washed up at 17. It&amp;#39;s not like I don&amp;#39;t have friends. But i sure as hell can&amp;#39;t indulge in anything, or have any kind of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend guilt-tripped me for it, too. &amp;quot;Your parents aren&amp;#39;t gonna pay for you forever!&amp;quot; Yeah, because hopefully I&amp;#39;ll be dead before there&amp;#39;s anything else for them to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister tries to encourage me, but it&amp;#39;s so back-handed. Everyone in my family thinks it&amp;#39;s so fucking easy. It&amp;#39;s not. I can&amp;#39;t work in fast food/a restaurant because my anxiety is too high and I&amp;#39;ll just get stressed and cry and then I&amp;#39;ll get fired for being an unprofessional little bitch. I could work in retail, but all the retail stores are way too far away from my house to walk. I applied for a night-shift job at the grocery store because I knew that it would be less stressful, but they denied my application. I could probably get an interview if I applied for a daytime job, but there&amp;#39;s too many people. Nothing is right for me because I&amp;#39;m a picky piece of shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told my friend I wanted to call a hotline, but I also know how those things work and that&amp;#39;s not what I want. I want someone that is in my life to either be truthful and tell me I&amp;#39;m a piece of shit, or abandon me. It&amp;#39;s easier that way. At least I&amp;#39;ll know it&amp;#39;s not a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please. Someone, just &lt;em&gt;let me die.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As a parent though your value changes even more. You are simply a biproduct body which fills space. A body expected to to do and aolve everything. Society says it. 
And the fact is I cannot rely on anyone or lean on anyone because I actually have no one to lean on. Both my parents are dead. And I grew up in fostercare so even if they were alive they still wouldnt be apart of my life. 
Here are some things I'll list that Ive survived. 
1. Homelessness and hunger for the entirety of my childhood. 
2. Whitnessing drug and alcohol abuse by my parents as a child. 
3. Experiencing childhood molestation. 
4. Surviving the Northridge quake. 
5. Aurviving a building fire. 
6. Surviving no parental love, literally no love or affection by my parents, I learned I was loved through a song at Sunday school.
7.surviving almost being abducted.
8. Surviving rape. 
9. Surviving sex trafficking. 
10. Having a gun pointed at my head. 
11. Having my first child taken because I was a fister child and then working my ass off to get him back, the case closed because no actual reason was warrented in the first place. 
12. Surviving domestic violence, having a knife put to my knack and getting punched in the head. 
13. Surviving bullying, literal groups of kids that targeted me throughout elementary, middle and highschool. 
Here are some things Ive been told or names Ive been called. 
1. Peice of shit, White Trump Supporter ( voted Hillary. 
2. You should kill yourself. 
3. I hate you.
4. You dont desearve love. 
5. No wonder your ex hit you, you desearved it. 
6. You dont desearve your kids. 
7. Your stupid. 
8. Your ugly inside and out. 
9. Your a loser and will never amount to anything. 
Here are some things complete strangers have said or called me. 
1. Ugly ass White Bitch. 
2. Trying to make freinds I was told, ""I fucking hate white people,"" while having my food spit on and thrown at me. 
3. Your nothing your artwork sucks and no matter what you know how to do you'll never be apart of this family. 
4. Fucking White girl. 
5. Old ass, buck tooth White Bitch. 
6. Half breed white bitch. 
7. Scary ass Hoe.
8. I should fuck you up and make that pretty face ugly as fuck. 
9. Aww, your so ugly you look just like your dad.
So it goes to show, unprovoked I still get told these things. If I mattered then none of it would have happened and non of it would have been said. You see, after so much of it I truly believe all of it is true. 
I even went and got cosmetic fillers in my cheeks and for head and temples so I looked better. I still look the same ugly as he'll. 
If I had the money I'd get a mini facelift even though doctors tell me Im too young and dont need one. Id get cosmetic dentristy to fix my buck teeth I apparently have. I actually dont I just have overcrowding from having my wisdom teeth come in. Id probably get microblading on my eyebrows and tattoo makeup for my lips. Even though im only 125 ibs id still get a tummy tuck too and hip inplants so I had a tiny waist and wider looking hips. If I had the money id get all of that done so I could be pretty like what people think pretty should be. 
If I had the money id pay someone to pretent they were my family so I could pretend I had one other than just my children. 
If I had the money I'd pay for someone to erase all my memories of pain. But I don't. And so each day I feel like I'm ugly, gross, that my race makes me ugly and gross, and that any struggle I ever went through is pointless because my race says I'm priviledged by default. Doesnt matter I was raped and trafficked because hey it wouldnt be as bad if I wasnt white and also raped and trafficked so by this logic I still have priviledge. 
Anyone non white that puts me down and says derogatory insults is justified and if I stick up for myself I'm in the wrong because I'm white.

It's not even a lot in bills. It could be so much worse. It could be *so much worse*. My parents are alive and I could ask my older siblings for loans and I could just take more loans for my tuition so I really don't have anything to complain about.

But I'm just so fucking tired from the past month. The long story is that I got taken to the ER after having a seizure on Monday 9/23. Slept for three days. Took two midterms. Took another midterm that I failed *BADLY* the next Monday. Failed to turn in a project worth 10%. Had horrible nightmares every night from Levetiracetam. Wanted to die every day, started crying, wanting just to sleep, or jump off a building, anything. Either turned things in late or didn't turn them in because I couldn't focus. Had to quit work. Got another med that has sedated me so I've been sleeping for hours. Got sent $6000 dollars in medical bills. Had to drop the class I'm failing because I can't do it so I'll have to take it again and I'm only taking 12 credit hours this sem. Got diagnosed with unspecified bipolar disorder and will have to up my dose of Lamictal.

Now I have to apply for the FAFSA and school scholarships and financial assistance from the hospital and I have more midterms and the class I applied to drop hasn't been officially dropped so I still need to go but there's another midterm this Wednesday that I'll fail because I haven't been able to concentrate like a loser.

I feel like I can't do this anymore. There is *just* enough money in my checking account from work savings to pay the medical bills but I won't have any left over for rent and food and tuition/fees and I don't have a job now.

The only reason I've held on is I have a younger sister and I don't want her growing up knowing that her sister killed herself. But now it seems like it would be the right thing to do because I don't want to burden my parents by making them spend money that they don't have when my sister is so young and she needs to go to school. I just want to kill myself because I've been burdening my friends, roommates, boss, family with this shit and I'm so tired. I'm tired.

I don't know who else to tell because I don't want to concern my friends or parents even more and the crisis center at my school is useless and wasn't any help when I went last time yet still charged me $10 which is trivial but made me angry because I only went there because I was close to killing myself. I won't even be able to see a counselor I've seen before because there were no openings and I have to wait for November to see her and even then I can only speak to her for an hour when I feel like I can't stop pouring all of this out until years later.

I started writing a goodbye letter which I've never done before even at my old lowest points. I feel weak and helpless and stupid and lazy. If I were stronger then I would be able to handle this.

I keep thinking it would be the best option for me and everyone else if I just had the guts to kill myself and either my checking account would be emptied for the medical bills or my parents would just not have to pay it at all and then they could get the checking account money and save it for my younger sister. I'm less and less able to think of reasons why I shouldn't do that because I'm so, so, so fucking tired. It's not supposed to be my fault but I'm so ashamed of being so weak and so stupid and emotional and lazy, if I were just stronger then none of this would have happened, then I would have been able to pull myself together after the seizure and just do everything I should have done.

And now I've been declared bipolar which means I'm unstable and horrible and now dating will be even more impossible, and I'm afraid of losing my friends once they realize how disgusting and emotional and selfish I am because of this.

I just want to sleep forever and die and not have to deal with this anymore. I'm so tired, I'm tired and terrible. And no one needs to hear about this shit because I'm stupid and this is all nothing compared to what other people have been through but god I just can't do this, I'm weak, I can't do this.

Killing myself would end this for me, would remove the burden I am on everyone in my life. This seems like the best option for everyone I love. I don't love myself, that's not why I'm still alive. I'm only alive because I thought it would hurt the people around me but I know they can just get over it and then they'll never have to deal with how horrible I am.

It sounds bad but wouldn't it just be better for me to die and get this over with since I've been thinking about suicide since I was twelve anyway and killing myself would end things forever and I would never have to incur medical expenses for my weaknesses ever again? Then no one would have to try to comfort me when I get so sick so fucking often.

I have major depression and have attempted suicide in my past multiple times and I have absolutely zero self esteem/value. I'm sorry because I know this is a long post. 

 I really never thought I'd share this to the whole world on the internet but I feel I need to get it out. I know I'm going to kill myself, i can't see any other way around this. My life is either intense feelings of anguish and thoughts of inadequacy screaming in my head at my worst and then when I'm ""normal"" it's the total lack of feeling anything. I don't feel pride, I don't feel happiness, I don't feel ambition. Just a hazy fog of numbness with sadness in the background. 

Where do I begin, my dad left me when I was middle school because he was abusive and chose heroin over his family, I was bullied relentlessly in middle and high school, I was cheated on in a relationship of two years, and my last relationship ended with them telling me my feelings ""were taxing"". You'd think when I get home it'd be better? No, my mom tells me things I supposedly lie about when it legitimately wasn't me then justifies it with ""you lied before so I can't trust you"" but she never puts the effort to trust me. She belittles me by insulting me, she tells me I'm a disappointment, embarrassment, how she and my brother don't won't me to live with them, that if i ""ask for pity"" by telling my grandmother how depressed I am that she'll expose me for every wrong doing I've made, and how my relationship ended because it was my fault. This is just from today, she says the same and more things to me every. Single. Day. Both my brother and mom tell me how they hate me and how much of a burden I am to the both of them, my mom frequently reminds me how she didn't want children in the first place so ""to have me be so inconsiderate is just an insult"". The only thing she shows off about me is my shitty art, but it feels like she's just trying to show me off like I'm a pretty dog at a dog show... it's more to show off her then it is my capability to draw. There's so much more I can say but I don't want to waste anyone's time. 

At this point in life in life i know I'm going to kill myself, maybe not today but possibly tomorrow, a week from now.But the time is becoming closer and closer, I already cut myself (my mom screamed at me and told me how It should be her or my brother who cuts themselves over me which just prompted me to hide it more and cut deeper), well more like mutilate since my arm is absolutely destroyed. I wake up and get screamed at, I go to bed after getting screamed at. My mom tells me depression is just an attempt at invoking pity and that I'm ""an entitled little bitch"". Every thought of inadequacy I have is just reinforced to the point where it's my own voice screaming st me in my head how worthless and shitty of a human being I am. 

I just... can't bear this burden any longer. I'm sick of having these thoughts, I'm sick of being yelled at. I want to cry for help, I want to tell my family but I don't want to be an embarrassment to everyone else by having myself exposed. My mom tells my family how my dreams are just lies to shut people up and the worse part is they believe her... they have no clue the things she says to me and what happens at my house other then from her view and I can't change anything about it. Why I write this is because I don't know how much longer I plan to stay here. Death is scary but it's an escape, that's all I want. As selfish as this but what little friends I have, I'm willing to leave them. They'd understand why i did it, they wouldn't be happy but they wouldn't blame me. I just am exhausted, I want to be happy doing things I used to enjoy. I want to have the capability of having prolonged happiness rather then a fleeting sense of it followed by disappointment and self deprecation. I want to feel like I belong, like I have a place in this world and that these thoughts aren't true. But I don't have any of that, I'm planning on cutting myself really deep on both my arms and hanging myself. It's shameful to admit but I almost feel a sense of happiness about what I'm going to do. Again I don't know when, but it's going to happen. But that time is becoming tenuously thin.

&lt;p&gt;And it turned me into a hypersexual fucking slut. I can never have a normal relationship with another human being. Anyone who I talk to and click with, they run away because there&amp;#39;s too much baggage involved.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently life becoming worse and worse for me. I am now 17 and in my final year of school and my grades are complete shit. More family members have died of cancer and other illnesses, leaving only my mother, sister, aunt and cousin (who both moved to a different country to get away from the toxic family) two uncles (who are both on the autistic spectrum and are very aggressive/toxic) and grandmother and grandfather (one of which is a diagnosed narcaissist).

My father has been dead 4 years now but I still am affected by the times he had tried to kill my in rages due to the brain cancer. My best friend who supported me through my depression and suicidal thoughts died in a car accident nearly one year now. I am still getting bullied/mocked by people for my height/hairloss (I got male pattern balding at 14, which is almost uheard of and greatly affects my self esteem and social life). I still have my heart problems which prevent me from doing the activites and sports I used to enjoy when I was younger.

My mother got a boyfriend and is now planning to move to a different country when me and my sister turn 18, so 1 and 1/2 years away from now and has said multiple times that she wishes we would fuck off and that she isn't going to support us both anymore from then on and will cut off contact.

I have tried applying to multiple jobs to start saving for a house due to my mother abandoning us however I have been rejected or never got a call back from all of them. My father left a sum of money for me and my sister for when we turn 21 around $80-$100k but my grandmother is in charge of giving it to us, she is a diagnosed narcissist. I have almost no money saved up, my parents never gave me money or birthday presents and rather spent it on expensive designer clothes, jewlery or furniture for themselves.

I have tried some of the advice you gave me last year such as try to find a girlfriend. That has gone badly since I would not conside myself attractive due to hair loss and short height. I also rarely find a romantic connection with women I always gets rejected friendzoned and I am not intrested in persuing romantic relationships with my female friends. So I basically gave up on that.

Since my best friend died I have nobody to talk to about me depression, all the councillors, doctors and phycologist have been of no help to me and keep saying shit like ""don't worry, in a few years it will get better"" however its been nearly 8 years since I was first told that and everything has just got worse.

I am essentially going to become homeless next year since I have no support, family and friends that will help/be in a position to. There are also a huge lack of homeless and mental health resources in my country.

All of this sadness has been turning into anger and at sometimes I barely recognise myself anymore. I feel like there is a monster clawing and scratching to get outside. I really don't want to do something stupid/ get in trouble for. I feel like suicide is the only option to protect myself and those around me.

I have no idea what to do anymore. I feel like an abomination that was never meant to exist and just to fail in life. I have tried masking all of this with positivity however underneath the mask I am cracking and eroding.

I don't know what to do anymore and I feel like this is the final chapter of my my life which is coming close to the end.

My story's really not any different from any other story that gets posted here, especially as it relates to being trans. Within the past few weeks I've come to realize that I am what I've completely passively repressed since 5th grade, and it really fucking hurts.

I don't really know what to do, and maybe that's the underlying problem; but it's such a massive thing to be afraid. In my brain, I feel that I'd gain nothing from therapy. I've such a jaded view of it, that I'm too self-aware of how fucked I am that it would just be a joke to try it. That and piling on being a *girl* on top of most likely having BPD and legitimate depression. It would just be a joke to go to therapy.

That only makes me think of actually transitioning. And that's when the crying starts. Would that I could go back fourteen years to when I was 10, and not have to go through puberty as a boy; instead, try and transition then. I have zero expectation that if I tried to transition now, I'd come out the other side as the girl that I've built up in my dreams. That I'm relegated to spending my life trapped inside this disgusting host body wrecks my core.

I have no actual friends, only people who I talk with online. And really, only a couple even can understand at all what it feels like. But in that end it's all meaningless as their words are simply just words spoken hundreds of miles away from people that ultimately I mean very little. It's what all of you are as well, try as you will to argue differently. I've definitely given up on the notion of finding any sort of intimate relationship: it's my lot in life to be the virgin who cries browsing pornhub, both out of desire to have sex and desire to be attractive enough to be a camgirl. To what extent that springs forward from being a chaste monk I don't know but it just fucking hurts to be ugly and unwanted. 

I'm not particularly good at much of anything, and certainly nothing of any use or value. I suppose my ultimate passions lie in world-building, graphic design and, of course, consuming media. But I never get to watch movies or listen to music or game with people, no matter how much I'd like. It's always just me at the cinema alone, or reading and drinking coffee alone; and that entirely ridiculous notion of everyone staring at the *loser* by themself eats away at me so much even though I know that no-one really cares. And the isolation always knaws at me when I'm sat alone in my apartment. 

I suppose at this point the only thing that I'm really living for is Star Wars for the rest of the year: the Mandalorian, Fallen Order and the Rise of Skywalker. Past that, I don't really want to live to my 25th birthday. I'm utterly terrified of death, but it's just so, so tiring to continue living like this.

Congratulations to anyone who actually reads any of this garbage. I just can't process any of this in my own head anymore. I can't shove away these thoughts and repress being trans any longer.

When I was put in there, my family blamed it on Prozac, seeing as one of its side effects is suicidal thoughts.

I’ve talked to therapist after therapist and I told them all the same thing.

But I haven’t told anyone why I really wanted to kill myself. Not even my closest friends.

The real reason I wanted to die was because of a girl.

I know it sounds stupid, but hear me out.

I had known this girl for years, and have had a HUGE crush on her from the second I was introduced to her.

Many years went by, she had moved back and forth a few times.

When she came back this time, I confessed my feelings for her. She said the feelings were mutual, but she wasn’t ready for a relationship yet, seeing as she had just gotten out of a bad relationship. I made sure to let her know that I understood, and planned to respect that.

About a month goes by and she is very flirty with me. Touching me, writing me little notes, making fun of eachother, sending me hearts, etc.

However, just when I think I’m getting somewhere, she gets back together with her ex.

They were all over eachother. Their social media’s filled with posts about eachother, and going on and on about eachother. The works.

Now not only was I fucked sideways in this situation, but she still keeps me just close enough so that these feelings can’t go away. And she still does all the flirty things she did when she was single.

She is the only girl I’ve ever had feelings this strong for. I can’t help but love her.

But after a month and a half of this, It didn’t sting as bad, it just made me very depressed and sick.

I was starting to get over my suicidal feelings. The psych ward really helped me realize a lot. 

However, all of those feelings rushed back after we hung out.

We grabbed a pizza, watched a movie, made eachother laugh, and went for a walk in the autumn leaves.

She looked absolutely amazing. She made me happy. The entire time I was with her, I didn’t have a single worry. Nothing else mattered. It felt like I was in heaven.

It was then I realized how much I actually love her. 

She told me she loved me, but it felt so hollow, as if it barely meant anything to her. I just felt so empty knowing how disposable I am.

We talk often, and she says she considers me her best friend. I obviously play along, but she means far more to me than any friend ever has.

We talk almost every day, we hangout at least once a week, and she still acts as flirty as she used to, but I know it’ll never go anywhere.

It’s sad to say, but I put all my eggs in one basket, and somebody stole it.

I know I sound really pathetic, but that’s why I lied to everyone. I’m ashamed that she is the reason I wanted to end my life.

Don’t get it wrong, I have a life outside of her. I have friends and family and hobbies and things to be proud of, but it feels like none of that matters without her.

I’m truly a piece of shit, but I guess that’s why I’m saying this to strangers on the internet.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was recently put in a psych ward for the suicidal because I was stupidly dropping major hints that I planned to kill my self in hopes that I could ask for help without destroying my pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I haven’t told anyone why I really wanted to kill myself. Not even my closest friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real reason I wanted to die was because of a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds stupid, but hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had known this girl for years, and have had a HUGE crush on her from the second I was introduced to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many years went by, she had moved back and forth a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she came back this time, I confessed my feelings for her. She said the feelings were mutual, but she wasn’t ready for a relationship yet, seeing as she had just gotten out of a bad relationship. I made sure to let her know that I understood, and planned to respect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month goes by and she is very flirty with me. Touching me, writing me little notes, making fun of eachother, sending me hearts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just when I think I’m getting somewhere, she gets back together with her ex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were all over eachother. Their social media’s filled with posts about eachother, and going on and on about eachother. The works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now not only was I fucked sideways in this situation, but she still keeps me just close enough so that these feelings can’t go away. And she still does all the flirty things she did when she was single.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is the only girl I’ve ever had feelings this strong for. I can’t help but love her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after a month and a half of this, It didn’t sting as bad, it just made me very depressed and sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was starting to get over my suicidal feelings. The psych ward really helped me realize a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, all of those feelings rushed back after we hung out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We grabbed a pizza, watched a movie, made eachother laugh, and went for a walk in the autumn leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She looked absolutely amazing. She made me happy. The entire time I was with her, I didn’t have a single worry. Nothing else mattered. It felt like I was in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was then I realized how much I actually love her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She told me she loved me, but it felt so hollow, as if it barely meant anything to her. I just felt so empty knowing how disposable I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talk often, and she says she considers me her best friend. I obviously play along, but she means far more to me than any friend ever has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talk almost every day, we hangout at least once a week, and she still acts as flirty as she used to, but I know it’ll never go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s sad to say, but I put all my eggs in one basket, and somebody stole it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I sound really pathetic, but that’s why I lied to everyone. I’m ashamed that she is the reason I wanted to end my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get it wrong, I have a life outside of her. I have friends and family and hobbies and things to be proud of, but it feels like none of that matters without her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m truly a piece of shit, but I guess that’s why I’m saying this to strangers on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

As I said before, I like my career, but I don't see a future, I don't think it's going anywhere and I don't feel happy. I used to have long term goals and I used to know where I was headed to, but now I'm just doing things by pure inertia and I just can't find myself.

I've talked to some of my closest high school friends (I'm not close to my family, so I don't really trust them and I've never talked about my emotions with them) but it goes always the same, it turns into an awkward situation, they don't what to say (I don't judge them, it's a difficult topic to handle), we say goodbye and then it's never brought up again and it's like it never happened. This has led me to remain more closed and I really don't tell anyone anymore. Also, I know all my friends are happy, they have found their place, they have found new people, a career they like even with all the stress, so I simply do not wanna be a burden and take them back, because they have already moved on mostly. I've been thinking of seeing a therapist or something, but I can't work up the nerve to do so, and I really don't think I would open up so easy to someone I don't trust.

I don't really know what to do, I've also been thinking about dropping out from uni or taking a semester off, but I don't know, I would feel like a deception, my parents have spent a lot of money already, everyone is set in their new life, and I feel like I would be like that kid that doesn't know what to do, because let's be honest, everyone talks about the dropout who couldn't find its place, it's a thing our society does. But even if I take a semester off or something, I don't know what I would do, I would probably end up laying around being sad, and even if I find something new that I like, I'm scared it will be art history all over again, something I was sure about and now I'm here.

&lt;p&gt;Killing myself feels like the easier route because I don&amp;#39;t want to feel like this, feel this pain anymore, I don&amp;#39;t want this horrible uncertainty, I&amp;#39;ve thought for at least to months about just ending it all. I haven&amp;#39;t done it yet because I&amp;#39;m a coward, and because I feel there are some people that would be really hurt (my grandmas, a couple of my friends). I hate myself for feeling this lonely, for not being able to just talk to new people, for not being able to feel happy, I just hate me and have been thinking about harming myself, just ending it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry if my writing is all over the place, I&amp;#39;m having a crisis at 5am and I&amp;#39;m not a native speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

I love video games, anime, watching Netflix and my dog. But I'm 22 fucking years old and not ONCE had a single paying job in my entire life.

I had a pacemaker at 16, got heart surgery done at 3 weeks old, almost became obese this year(225lbs at age 22, 5'8 height, but I lost weight and I'm 195lbs now), and my dad just lost his 2016 Acura MDX- white car a few weeks ago because he couldn't keep up with the bills since there's 3 other kids in the house who are ages 9, 11, and 16.

If you're wondering why I don't just get a damn job and pay my parents back. It's because of my weight(not that big of an issue as much anymore ofc), pacemaker which limits my job listings with a GED after dropping out my senior year, knee problems, back problems, vision problems(I'm partially blind and still can't afford glasses), and the fact I can't stand up moving around no more than 20 minutes unless you want a mini pond in your store. No one wants a fat sweaty fuck with heart disease, medical problems, and a pacemaker that limits their carrying weight capacity. I least I don't smell bad and keep myself smelling fresh tbh..

My mom spent A LOT of money to have me lose weight this year. And it worked wonders. Though I still have 30 pounds to lose until my initial goal of being 165 is finally accomplished, I still want my life to end. I've honestly been stuck at 191-195 for the past month and a half. It's been hard losing the weight. It seems I have to push myself 2-3 times harder than what I've been doing so far.

Though I know I can do it and finally achieve it around 4-6 months. At what cost did it take? Hundreds, if not thousands for me to lose all that weight, my dad losing his car and stuck with using the family SUV, and the fact he works 10 hours a day and 6 to possibly 7 days a week just to provide for the family and keep up with my medical bills? Though sometimes every few weeks or a month, he gets a 3 day break.

I should've fucking died in that fucking hospital when there was a problem with closing up the hole in my heart that I had since I was a baby. Instead, I managed to somehow fucking survive an operation that I otherwise shouldn't have and if they'd continued or try again, I'd surely die. And so the second time around, they decided to put a pacemaker inside of me. I believe that's when my life and my family's life truly went to Hell.

If God is real, then Fuck You, asshole. Should've let me die in that operating room.

I honestly don't know why I'm still alive, why I didn't die when I should have and why I had to lose 30 pounds just before having obesity. I'm stuck between 2 paths whether I should continue to see how much more of my pathetic life I could fuck up for others or just end it all now and at least know while my family will cry and mourn at my funeral, my family would eventually move on and truly live a better life without me.

They can take all the money they saved up for me and the college funds they still kept, since I never went to college, and go nuts with the money. Hell, I wouldn't even mind if they threw a damn party in celebration of finally getting rid of me and relieved that they don't have to live in that hellish world for the past 6 years anymore.

My life was over the moment I should've died on the operating room. I still question why I survived. I don't know if it was divine intervention, an instinct of my body for survival or simply pure dumb luck. Either way, as far as I have known my life for the past 6 years, it's been total fucking hell. My life was a million times better before that day. My story should've ended there. I just want all the painful thoughts and financial sufferings to go away.

Through all the bad, there hasn't been many good in my life since then. I spoil my little sister, smile back and make her laugh. While a part of me loves seeing her happy and is joyful at times, most of what I do is just all an act so I don't ever have to see her face sad and have her wonder why I'm like this in a shitty situation. Because then I'll be sad and become more depressed with her sad face.

I believe her life would be better without me. I already think my 16 year old brother thinks so too. I haven't really spoken to him all year this year. And when we do, it's only about video games, anime and the usually chores around the house. That's basically it. I haven't really gotten to learn more about him this year and know about his life at school and out of school. And he's the adventurous outdoorsy kind of guy. So he has lots of stories to always tell. He plays video games too and loves to be lazy like me when he's home and has nothing to do on the weekend. But what guy doesn't?

Haven't really been that close to him anymore since then. After we have conversations about those stuff. He says ""Okay, shoo. Close my door please."" Or adds in ""Go away"" after the ""shoo"" part. But he plays it off like he's just being theatrical and messing around. But you can tell he's serious behind his ""jokes"". It's probably a hint telling me to leave him alone so he can have a peace of mind during the weekends and for me to finally just do it already.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m fucking sick of this shit.

I would have turned 17 7 months ago and I miss him more and more everyday, it’s not sad any longer because I know he’s not in pain anymore.
He died of stage 4 spinal cancer and I watched him slip further and further into a spiral of pain as he slowly died far too young.
I wish I could give him some of my years that I have left, he deserves to be alive, he was never cruel and never cowardly. He cared for every single person that walks the planets surface and he loved and loved and loved without asking for anything in return. 
I made a promise to him, the last time I saw him properly, he told me that he doesn’t want to see me for a very long time and I promised him that it would be many years before we meet again. It sounds cruel and mean and morbid for people that weren’t us. What we meant was that he’s going to die, in the afterlife, if there is one, then he wants to have to wait. He wanted me to live the life he missed out on. 
My friends said that he would be proud of me, but of course he is, he was proud of me for even getting out of bed some days. I just don’t want to break a promise, I have never broken a promise before and I think the day I break my oldest, strongest promise is the day I die. Ironic yet truthful. 
He was the love of my life, not sexually or romantically. He was the guy for me, he was my best friend I would spend every minuet without him waiting for him.

Even when I was off my tits on what ever new drug I found to take the pain away. 
He was the only thing that stopped the pain.
He saved my life, multiple times, he still saves my life even though he’s not actually here.
I once did mushrooms and I only needed to do it the once because the face I saw in front of me was his, it made me happy and I cried. Then bad things started to cloud my vision and I never did mushrooms again. It was terrible.
He concurred a price to my life, he made it worth something but he’s gone now and I do not know what to do with this currency.
I’m alive now, because he’s not.
I just miss him so much, but I’m grateful for the days we had, when I get upset I hear his croaky prepubescent voice tell me that everything is going to be ok.

I've been planning on ending my life for a while, just struggled with finding the optimal time. That time, however, is tomorrow (Monday) or Wednesday at the latest.

I've wasted the last seven years on a business that has now resulted in me owing a considerable sum of money and despite what should be a reasonable resume I seem unable to find suitable employment.

For the past seven years I worked extremely hard and ultimately have nothing to show for it. Everyone I know either buying homes, travelling or having kids and I have none of these things. 

My wife will be home late on Monday and Wednesday so I have the opportunity to kill myself in front of an express train. Based on my research, finding an express train is important as it should have a speed that results in death.

I am open to other methods of suicide, ideally I would prefer not to involve a train driver, but my research has not found another method that is as accessible.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

he told me about everything, how he had everything planned out. he texted all his friends telling them he is moving away and won’t be in contact anymore and that he is sorry. he was going to jump off golden gate bridge which is 7 hours drive. he told me that the days we spent made him realize how happy he can be and that i saves him. we threw away the note and i never got to read it. i got his sister’s number, so it anything happened at least i would have someone to contact.

it keeps on happening, his suicidal episodes. he can be happy and loving and talkative and then in few days or even hours he is stuck in his room for days just rotting there, just a void, he says. he doesn’t have a job, doesn’t go to school and he just sees himself as worthless. now im thousands of miles away, i feel like i am sitting in the same room watching him die piece by piece. he talked about suicide multiple times again, that he just finds such a peace in the though of, it feels so right and he is so done. that he dreams about it every day and is tired of fantasizing about something he can have. that he just wasn’t meant for life.

i contacted his sister. she told their dad. he is seeing therapist now, every monday. he doesn’t believe in help, doesn’t believe in psychology but he just does it cause “what’s else there left to do”. but it’s just not enough, i tried to tell his sister he needs psychiatrist and that he just might lose him any day and i don’t know, all she says is that she doesn’t know what else to do. that it takes time. i wish she knew there might be no time.

he hasn’t replied to me for few days now, doesn’t pick up calls and i just don’t know if he is still here. it’s pure torture living like this, not knowing if the person you love is gonna be alive in the next day, hour, minute. what if they are taking their life away this very second while you’re out there? i’m not a strong person, i never was. i’ve  also been dealing with depression, self harm and suicidal thoughts and i just can’t take it. 

i won’t stay here if he is gone. if he leaves. he is the only one that’s been making this world bearable for me, i love him. i never loved anyone. i never was never really happy anyways. sometimes i think maybe it’s best to kill
myself before i get to experience the feeling of losing him. i don’t wanna know what it feels and i live scared every day, it’s hanging over me every single day since i wake up till i go to sleep. i just don’t know how long i can go on like this. i can’t help him, i don’t know how to help him. loving people doesn’t save them so i just stand here watching him die.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i just don’t know how long i can take this. i (21f) am in love with a person (22m) that lives at the other side of the world and has been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts since i knew him (been over a year now). it’s gotten much worse lately and we met a month ago and before i left he wanted to give me this note and i just had bad feeling. he told me to open it when i’m back to my country and i kept on asking what’s in there and he just ended up saying it’s just “feelings. nice words.” but was still holding it in his hand, hesitating about giving it to me. i just felt. he broke down few minutes after saying he cannot do it to me and yes, it was a goodbye note. he planned on seeing me for the last time and killing himself upcoming weekend. i had the most hysterical attack i ever had in my life, i said things i probably shouldn’t have, i swore to him if he does it, he should know he is killing two people at the time. i swore on my family i’m gonna do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i contacted his sister. she told their dad. he is seeing therapist now, every monday. he doesn’t believe in help, doesn’t believe in psychology but he just does it cause “what’s else there left to do”. but it’s just not enough, i tried to tell his sister he needs psychiatrist and that he just might lose him any day and i don’t know, all she says is that she doesn’t know what else to do. that it takes time. i wish she knew there might be no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he hasn’t replied to me for few days now, doesn’t pick up calls and i just don’t know if he is still here. it’s pure torture living like this, not knowing if the person you love is gonna be alive in the next day, hour, minute. what if they are taking their life away this very second while you’re out there? i’m not a strong person, i never was. i’ve  also been dealing with depression, self harm and suicidal thoughts and i just can’t take it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i won’t stay here if he is gone. if he leaves. he is the only one that’s been making this world bearable for me, i love him. i never loved anyone. i never was never really happy anyways. sometimes i think maybe it’s best to kill
myself before i get to experience the feeling of losing him. i don’t wanna know what it feels and i live scared every day, it’s hanging over me every single day since i wake up till i go to sleep. i just don’t know how long i can go on like this. i can’t help him, i don’t know how to help him. loving people doesn’t save them so i just stand here watching him die.&lt;/p&gt;

""I could take them all out.

Something along those lines. 

I once saw a line in a fan fiction, about the impact the death of a main character could have. It talked about how this character, let's call him X, could go out with such brilliance that surely the whole world would feel his loss. Not literally, obviously, but the magnitude of his destruction would shake the very foundation of all who knew him.

And sometimes, I understand that potential of destruction - and the power it grants. That feeling of knowing that there ARE a few who love you &amp; may be devastated, but forget them because here you are alone right now &amp; you could just - bring it all to ruins. 

And they couldn't do a single thing about it. 

Because it's your choice. 

Your choice.  
One move and I could take an emotional missile to their lives. I could pull the rug from beneath their feet, just like the world has so many times. 

I could do it. 

And then, promptly on the heels of that thought of a contained, but effective explosion to my inner circle, comes the remembrance of one's own insignificance. That realization of ""oh yeah. I might break them, but they could rebuild.""

They would keep living. And whatever I'd done to spite the universe would only truly ruin me.

It wouldn't really matter if I died - just like it doesn't really matter that I live. And then I find myself still wishing for death, except now I'm EXTRA sad.

I literally have no idea where to start.... wat

Hello person reading this, here goes
I have a long history of mental illness, so honestly I’m not surprised that I came crawling back to a place for help. 
I’ve been hospitalized four times for attempts and suicidal ideation in the past year, but this time I’m determined not to go back. Im really tired of feeling like I’ve let everyone down by trying to escape. I’m really tired of acting like I’m okay even though I know my medication isn’t working, and at this point since I’ve been in this position before, I know what comes next       

Going to the hospital again for help isn’t an option. I know I can’t just fix everything overnight. These problems didn’t get here overnight so I can’t fix it by 5 o’clock tomorrow. But these feeing need to leave, I need a medication that works, or this time I really need to succeed in my attempt, because at this point I’m not going back to the hospital. It’s sad when the nurses know you on a first name basis

I just feel as if maybe I’m not meant to get better, that maybe if I try again I should just succeed. And part of me wants help but I’ve gotten help before, and I obviously still very much would like to be dead. 

One of the social workers in the hospital for group would say this, “Is it that you don’t want to live? Or is it that you don’t want to live like this?”
I love that, but honestly it feels like it’s come to the point where indeed I just don’t want to live, and I don’t want to go to heaven, I don’t want to go to hell or wherever you might believe we go, I just want to be wiped out of existence, if dying is my ticket there? Then so be it. 

I don’t know maybe you can help me clear some things and poke holes in places so I can see clearer, because right now my brain is a mess. Sorry for the long post, hope you have a good day/night, and you are okay too.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might be long so if you skip over me that’s okay, there’s a lot of people who need help here.  &lt;/p&gt;

How do I reconcile my desire to be honest with 1) getting professional help, 2) not being able to promise I won’t kill myself, and 3) avoiding the ER / hospitalization? 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m looking for advice, understanding, or support from anyone who wants to give it. Here goes:

I’m an almost 40-year-old woman and have dealt with depression on and off most of my life. I’m not that attached to life and don’t see myself ever being glad to be alive in the future. However, I have obligations that make staying alive for a few more years the right thing to do. I started to slip into a really bad episode a few months ago. About one month ago, I went back on the medication that helped me last time I was really suicidal, but it doesn’t seem to be helping that much.

Some of the worst times are when I’m hit by these waves of something extra. Something like terror, panic - I don’t know. It’s like I’m choking on air when I’m trying to breathe. Similar to the feeling I’d get if I were looking down off a cliff (I have a fear of heights), terrified and wanting to move away. Except instead of feeling that way about staring off a cliff, I feel it about just being alive. I feel driven to get away from the source of these feelings - me being alive - and start getting a bit frantic, looking for a way out. 

During these times, I’ve always been able to keep at least a weak grasp on reality and hold on to something that keeps me from taking any action\*. This changed last week, and I slipped a bit further. I was trying to calm down by taking some deep breaths and looked up and immediately thought of hanging myself off of the object attached to the wall. I knew that wouldn’t work because it wouldn’t support my weight. I walked out of that room and sat down in another. Then, within 10-20 minutes, I’d found a way that would work and had gotten everything set up. I paused before taking action to do a final mental run through and realized this was a horrible idea. I was likely to automatically panic and try to reverse course but be unable to do so. I didn’t feel bad enough to be okay with dying like this. 

I think there’s a decent chance I would have gone through with it if 1) I was feeling significantly worse, or 2) I’d been fixated on a different method that would result in a more acceptable death. 

The thing that bothers me about the above incident is that it feels like I didn’t really get to make the decision on whether or not to die. I was acting as though I’d already made the decision, but I don’t remember even thinking about it. I didn’t have a chance to make the choice.

I guess I feel even less in control than I did before. Also, honesty has always been very important to me and I don’t know what to do now because 1) I want medication, 2) I don’t think I can honestly promise to not kill myself, and 3) I don’t want to go to the ER or be locked in a hospital. I already feel like I was dishonest the other day with the doctor prescribing my medication because I mentioned suicidal thoughts (but not the hanging incident) and ended up agreeing to go to the ER if I thought I might act on the thoughts. 

I don’t want anyone who has tried to help me to feel bad or to face any trouble because of me.

&amp;#x200B;

Therapy: I might consider it when I’m less suicidal. I saw a therapist last time I was really suicidal and for a while afterwards. He played a major role in keeping me alive. I don’t want to put someone through that again, though. Plus, I'm afraid of being locked up this time.

&amp;#x200B;

\* I made one sort-of attempt years ago but it was not during one of these driven-to-escape episodes. It was almost perfect - peaceful death and wouldn’t have looked like a suicide. I crawled out before I passed out after realizing that somebody was going to be held responsible for my death.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: It appears that I don’t have as much control as I thought over dying by suicide.

  I feel like ending it all. I quit my job to focus on my education, but i’ve been so tired lately. It seems like I can’t do anything now. I have a hard time hanging out with my friends and my girlfriend, doing my online classes, or really doing anything. I haven’t been able to think straight because of it. Which is what honestly prevents me from focusing on my education. I know if I really focus and work hard I can become the next Elon Musk. I just.. feel it in my gut. I’ve always thrived and been really interested in S.T.E.M. since childhood. I have a really solid plan to get there too. To become the next Elon Musk.

I feel like killing myself though, there’s a shotgun in the other room. That I’ve even picked up twice, sitting on my desk, fantasizing about blowing my brains and spraying the wall with my blood. But every time I do actually pick it up I get scared. And what about my family and friends? I really don’t want to hurt them. Would they be shocked? That the friend they thought would never even think about committing suicide, actually decides to blow his brains out. I wish I could just die in bed.

Please, I could really use some encouragement

I was put into the foster care system in Australia when I was 3 and stayed there till I was 18. Thankfully I didn’t cycle a lot like most kids and I found a foster family who I now call my real family. 

I’m having a really difficult time at the moment, this year had been really really tough. I’m in my 4th year of uni and I’ve failed the last 2 years because of my mental state, I’ve been seeing counsellors and doctors and I’m on medication. 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and now been medicated for that. But I just need to vent so I’m going to talk about my year and how’s it’s been the worst and best year I’ve had in a very long time. 

So the best year started on the 31st of December 2018. I was at college by myself over Christmas and in news years eve I wanted to spend it with someone because I couldn’t with my foster family. I invited 2 friends that were in my town at the time who came over. We sat and chatted for an hour and they started to get bored, my mate asked if he could invite a friend over to join us, I agreed. This friend ended up bringing a fair few people, I would say around 10. Me being anxious as all shit over everything in life, freaked out and stayed silent. I ended up having a few drinks and with each one became more confident and less anxious. Turns out these people were pretty amazing, I made a friend who was 7ft tall and he was honestly the big friendly giant. I made another friend who I’ll call Max, we hit it off straight away and I’ve never connected so well with someone. We instantly became best friends, he stayed over my place for an entire month until we decided to move out with 2 of our other friends, one of those who was homeless and was desperately trying to find someone to live. 

A little back story before we get rocky, I lived at a university where at the time our “flat” (8 bedroom house sorta thing) was located on campus. All 8 people were and still are my closest friends. They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me. They are very honest people and they told me before moving that I shouldn’t, that it wouldn’t work out and that the people I’m moving in with aren’t who I think they are and it won’t work out. Me being stubborn ignored all their warnings. I have this bad habit of meeting someone and when I get along with them as well as I did with Max, I latch on and I just want to hang and spend all my time with them and it always ends up ending badly. 

Back to the story, I ended up moving in with these 3 people. It was bloody fantastic, I had the most amazing time with them. We would spend all night and all day talking and having fun and it really did mess with my studies and sleep. I dropped studying all together and ignored it and my insomnia got worse. On May 21st we planned on going out, we drank a whole lot and went to the club. My house mates and I decided to take MDMA which we had bought the same day. There was 2 capsules and a rock. Now I’ve done drugs before, I do it recreationally, when I’ve taken MDMA I’ve only ever had it in capsules so I asked to have the 2 capsules just because it was familiar and I get very anxious trying new things. Well, we all took our share, went on the dance floor and that’s all I remember. I woke up in hospital the next day and the doctor spoke to me about what was in my system. The capsules ended up being MDMA, ketamine and ice. My body couldn’t handle the adverse reaction and basically shut down. The doctor send me home and I had the biggest come down that I’ve ever had in my life. It got around that I had taken the drugs and I got into a lot of trouble, I got banned from the uni bar and I was ashamed to show my face at uni and the colleges so I actively avoided it for about a month. During this month I’ve never been so miserable. I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone. There was parties in my house and I just laid in my room and cried while the world went by. It may sound ridiculous but I haven’t had a great life and the smallest things get to me. 

After the month, I kinda got over the overdose and went about my days. Life started getting a bit better again, there were more smiles and laughter. One of my house mates during the time we lived together was terrible with money. He gets paid at 12:30am every Sunday and goes out every Saturday night so usually he spends all his pay as soon as it comes in on drinks. Because of this, my room mates and I had to cover his rent and food throughout the week. This lasted for a few months. Things started getting worse with the guy, he gets very angry and started masking his problems with drugs- specifically weed. He would go out everyday and get really high so he didn’t have to deal with his problems, my room mates and I were getting very broke trying to support him and it got to the point we couldn’t anymore. He never paid us back after countless promises and he never did anything around the house. One night we got into a massive fight and I kicked him out, we stayed friends and we spoke all the time and we learnt it was better this way. We became closer not living together because we didn’t have the tension and added stress. 


(I’m sorry this story jumps a lot, there’s so much content that I can’t really focus) 


I didn’t realise till after I kicked him out how much I spent time with him. My other two room mates were sleeping together since the start and they would spend 60% of their time in bed. Because of this, the room mate I kicked out and I got really close because we only had each other. After kicking him out I was very lonely. I don’t deal well with being alone and I constantly need company so I feel okay. The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her; which left me and the girl to get very close. Now all these people I consider my close friends, but the girl and I became really close and spent a lot of time together. We were just friends, and that’s the way I liked it. We would spend every night chatting and laughing and having a grand old time while my other roommate was off with the girl he liked. The girl he liked who studies nursing ended up leaving for placement. She had to move away for 6 weeks to study so he spent more time with us at the flat. I started getting more and more depressed, just little things getting to me and stuff playing on my mind. One of my biggest stresses were bills and money. Our first electricity bill was close to $700 and that was for one month. I was so stressed about the next one that it made me really depressed. About 5 months after the first bill, our second one was due. About a month before I knew we would receive it I tried my hardest to start looking for ways I could pay it in case it was as high as the first. I desperately were looking for jobs, I started thinking about selling my stuff and I couldn’t think of anything. So I came to the conclusion that I might not be able to pay it, and that if I could, when the next bill came out I would have to do this all over again. So I decided it might be best for me to move back to college. I ended up telling my room mates and they weren’t happy about it, we got into a fight and upset me so much. I was so stressed and sad that I thought I couldn’t take it anymore. So I went to my medicine draw and grabbed every pill I could find and took them. It ended up being about 70 different pills in total. After doing it I freaked out and called my house mates, they both had left to go to a party. The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk. The girl was very supportive and stayed with me the entire time at the hospital, my other room mate, Max, didn’t visit me at all. I considered Max a brother too me, I loved him dearly and I tried to do whatever I could for him to show how much I appreciate him. When he didn’t visit me it really got to me and upset me. We spoke and he was angry and upset with me for doing what I did, so I left the house for over a week and stayed at the flat where I used to stay. I waited for him to calm down and I went home, I didn’t want him to be angry and upset with me so I thought I would give him the space. 

I started seeing counsellors and psychiatrists. My counsellor helped me quite a bit, she was the first counsellor I’ve actually enjoyed talking too and looked forward to seeing. We worked through my problems and she came to the conclusion that leaving the house would be for the best and she supported my decision of going back to college, so I did. After I told my room mates I was doing this they hated me. They didn’t want to speak to me or see me. They said some pretty nasty things to me, and I back to them. 

I lost my two best friends, and my brother. 

It’s been just over 2 months since I’ve moved out and I’m still miserable about it all. I think about them everyday and I see all their Snapchat’s together and it ruins me because we used to do everything together. Because I left my lease I’m in debt up to my eyebrows. I had to come up with a bond and 2 weeks rent for my college and I have to come up with money for the bills towards the house that I still haven’t paid, and unable to afford. I’ve taken out 3 loans since leaving which has put me through further debt and I don’t know what to do.

The last 3 weeks have been the worst for me. I haven’t stopped crying, I’ve been using drugs and alcohol to mask my responsibilities and now everything has creeped up on me. I can’t stop reflecting about everything this year and the pros and cons and it’s hard to see the positive ahead. I’ve lost my dog, my 2 best friends, I’m a couple thousand dollars in debt, I’m failing uni and my head is so fucked up I can’t think straight. Suicide is constantly on my mind and I can’t help but think it’s the only way out. I don’t know what to do or who to speak too. I can’t take out anymore loans and I hate asking for help from the people I love and care about. So I’m coming to reddit for some advice, some positive thoughts or anything. I’m lost and hopeless and I think it’s coming to the end of my time. How do I get past this? I don’t think I can do this anymore.

We would spend all night and all day talking and having fun and it really did mess with my studies and sleep. I dropped studying all together and ignored it and my insomnia got worse. On May 21st we planned on going out, we drank a whole lot and went to the club. My house mates and I decided to take MDMA which we had bought the same day. There was 2 capsules and a rock. Now I’ve done drugs before, I do it recreationally, when I’ve taken MDMA I’ve only ever had it in capsules so I asked to have the 2 capsules just because it was familiar and I get very anxious trying new things. Well, we all took our share, went on the dance floor and that’s all I remember. I woke up in hospital the next day and the doctor spoke to me about what was in my system. The capsules ended up being MDMA, ketamine and ice. My body couldn’t handle the adverse reaction and basically shut down. The doctor send me home and I had the biggest come down that I’ve ever had in my life. It got around that I had taken the drugs and I got into a lot of trouble, I got banned from the uni bar and I was ashamed to show my face at uni and the colleges so I actively avoided it for about a month. During this month I’ve never been so miserable. I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone. There was parties in my house and I just laid in my room and cried while the world went by. It may sound ridiculous but I haven’t had a great life and the smallest things get to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the month, I kinda got over the overdose and went about my days. Life started getting a bit better again, there were more smiles and laughter. One of my house mates during the time we lived together was terrible with money. He gets paid at 12:30am every Sunday and goes out every Saturday night so usually he spends all his pay as soon as it comes in on drinks. Because of this, my room mates and I had to cover his rent and food throughout the week. This lasted for a few months. Things started getting worse with the guy, he gets very angry and started masking his problems with drugs- specifically weed. He would go out everyday and get really high so he didn’t have to deal with his problems, my room mates and I were getting very broke trying to support him and it got to the point we couldn’t anymore. He never paid us back after countless promises and he never did anything around the house. One night we got into a massive fight and I kicked him out, we stayed friends and we spoke all the time and we learnt it was better this way. We became closer not living together because we didn’t have the tension and added stress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’m sorry this story jumps a lot, there’s so much content that I can’t really focus) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t realise till after I kicked him out how much I spent time with him. My other two room mates were sleeping together since the start and they would spend 60% of their time in bed. Because of this, the room mate I kicked out and I got really close because we only had each other. After kicking him out I was very lonely. I don’t deal well with being alone and I constantly need company so I feel okay. The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her; which left me and the girl to get very close. Now all these people I consider my close friends, but the girl and I became really close and spent a lot of time together. We were just friends, and that’s the way I liked it. We would spend every night chatting and laughing and having a grand old time while my other roommate was off with the girl he liked. The girl he liked who studies nursing ended up leaving for placement. She had to move away for 6 weeks to study so he spent more time with us at the flat. I started getting more and more depressed, just little things getting to me and stuff playing on my mind. One of my biggest stresses were bills and money. Our first electricity bill was close to $700 and that was for one month. I was so stressed about the next one that it made me really depressed. About 5 months after the first bill, our second one was due. About a month before I knew we would receive it I tried my hardest to start looking for ways I could pay it in case it was as high as the first. I desperately were looking for jobs, I started thinking about selling my stuff and I couldn’t think of anything. So I came to the conclusion that I might not be able to pay it, and that if I could, when the next bill came out I would have to do this all over again. So I decided it might be best for me to move back to college. I ended up telling my room mates and they weren’t happy about it, we got into a fight and upset me so much. I was so stressed and sad that I thought I couldn’t take it anymore. So I went to my medicine draw and grabbed every pill I could find and took them. It ended up being about 70 different pills in total. After doing it I freaked out and called my house mates, they both had left to go to a party. The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk. The girl was very supportive and stayed with me the entire time at the hospital, my other room mate, Max, didn’t visit me at all. I considered Max a brother too me, I loved him dearly and I tried to do whatever I could for him to show how much I appreciate him. When he didn’t visit me it really got to me and upset me. We spoke and he was angry and upset with me for doing what I did, so I left the house for over a week and stayed at the flat where I used to stay. I waited for him to calm down and I went home, I didn’t want him to be angry and upset with me so I thought I would give him the space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started seeing counsellors and psychiatrists. My counsellor helped me quite a bit, she was the first counsellor I’ve actually enjoyed talking too and looked forward to seeing. We worked through my problems and she came to the conclusion that leaving the house would be for the best and she supported my decision of going back to college, so I did. After I told my room mates I was doing this they hated me. They didn’t want to speak to me or see me. They said some pretty nasty things to me, and I back to them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost my two best friends, and my brother. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been just over 2 months since I’ve moved out and I’m still miserable about it all. I think about them everyday and I see all their Snapchat’s together and it ruins me because we used to do everything together. Because I left my lease I’m in debt up to my eyebrows. I had to come up with a bond and 2 weeks rent for my college and I have to come up with money for the bills towards the house that I still haven’t paid, and unable to afford. I’ve taken out 3 loans since leaving which has put me through further debt and I don’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 3 weeks have been the worst for me. I haven’t stopped crying, I’ve been using drugs and alcohol to mask my responsibilities and now everything has creeped up on me. I can’t stop reflecting about everything this year and the pros and cons and it’s hard to see the positive ahead. I’ve lost my dog, my 2 best friends, I’m a couple thousand dollars in debt, I’m failing uni and my head is so fucked up I can’t think straight. Suicide is constantly on my mind and I can’t help but think it’s the only way out. I don’t know what to do or who to speak too. I can’t take out anymore loans and I hate asking for help from the people I love and care about. So I’m coming to reddit for some advice, some positive thoughts or anything. I’m lost and hopeless and I think it’s coming to the end of my time. How do I get past this? I don’t think I can do this anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for such a scattered story, there’s so much that’s happened that I tried to fill all the important parts and I’m writing this while crying and have realised it might not make sense or it be all jumbled.&lt;/p&gt;

You see
From my inception
God gave no generoicity
1994 I remember just the same
We lived near the shore
An earthquake came our way
We packed our bags and fled
Somewhere
Cold with steep hills
And that winter in 1995 
We survived a fire
And I remember
I remember the fire man who saved my favorite doll
A smile upon his face
But he knew nothing at all
Not that I watched my father bleed
Or found burnt spoons 
Upon the floor
No one cared to notice
The baren cubbords we always had
California, Sylmar, Sandiego, L.A and sacremento we fled
Washington, Seattle, camas, vancouver we sped
Cigarette smoke in my face
She smoked two packs a day
A mother was her name
Yet hardly every came
Hunger in my belly
Have you ever starved? 
Because I know the feeling
Of wishing my life didnt start
And years upon years of watching needles puncture veins
My father lost his mind
And drank his sorrows away
And I was placed in fostercare
I slept in strangers beds
I went to school to make freinds
Instead got hit in the head
Have you ever found yourself to be a target?
It seems thats all I ever was 
to be really anything
They said 
""Ugly White Bitch,""
""Your nothing,""
""I hate you""
Kids would follow me and throw things at me
At night I'd cry
For years I cried
Never saw my parents
No
Not until I took one off life support and another found dead on the street
All the while I wished for family
I wished for freinds
In each relationship I seemed to be a target
They said
""Your not as good an artist as me.""
"" your a peice of shit."" 
""You should kill yourself.""
""You dont desearve love""
""You dont desearve your kids.""
""I hate you.""
""Peice of shit, White Trump supporter.""
Even though I support no one, 
Never voted for a man who sexually assaulted women
Not when I myself am a survivor
Of
Rape
Molestation
Sex trafficking
But you said all those things
And they bore me down
Until I really became nothing
At night I cry
Wrap myself in my arms
And I pray for hope 
And I pray for pain to go away
Instead 
Just the other day
I was told I was nothing
And ugly
They said
""Ugly as hoe""
""I fucking hate White people,""
""""I'm going to knock your face out,""
And I thought
For a minute
Maybe I should knock myself out 
Instead
I'm a target you see
Of hatred
And shame
Of blame
Of anger
I attract it all

Then I wouldn't have these memories

I want to be nice to myself, to do good things for myself and enjoy my life, but I just hate myself so much. Ever since I was able to self-medicate my anxiety with drugs and alcohol the anxiety has gotten much worse. While thankfully it isn’t really pushing me into worse addiction, it makes me not even look forward to the distraction of consuming substances. I feel so empty, I’m in disbelief that life can feel so colorless. I spend all my time looking forward to partying that just makes me feel embarrassed and depressed, and sometimes actually materially affects my life. 

I’m sick of drugs and alcohol, but I use them to hide from myself. I know that in reality I have no choice to but to face myself but it is so hard when I hate that person so much. I might be getting fired from my job because of stupid drunken decisions, and I don’t even feel bad for myself, or want to fix things, I would really rather just die.

After a night of binge drinking I almost always wish it killed me, but I get sick long before that can happen, which makes me beyond embarrassed and forces people to help me, which is the last thing I want.

I love my boyfriend so much but I know he will get sick of dealing with me like they all do. I really don’t know what else I’m supposed to be getting out of my life. I was broken down so much in my self worth by my family and I don’t even care, they’re right, I just want to get off this ride. I feel like I don’t have anything to offer the world and I get dumber and more pathetic every day. I’m not very scared of being dead, but everything else is so daunting. But is it more daunting than living this life I’ve already screwed up so badly?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really just feel like I can’t stand myself. I want to be nice to myself, to do good things for myself and enjoy my life, but I just hate myself so much. Ever since I was able to self-medicate my anxiety with drugs and alcohol the anxiety has gotten much worse. While thankfully it isn’t really pushing me into worse addiction, it makes me not even look forward to the distraction of consuming substances. I feel so empty, I’m in disbelief that life can feel so colorless. I spend all my time looking forward to partying that just makes me feel embarrassed and depressed, and sometimes actually materially affects my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sick of drugs and alcohol, but I use them to hide from myself. I know that in reality I have no choice to but to face myself but it is so hard when I hate that person so much. I might be getting fired from my job because of stupid drunken decisions, and I don’t even feel bad for myself, or want to fix things, I would really rather just die. &lt;/p&gt;

She had three kids under the age of 18. Her death emotionally destroyed her family, including her sister, my mother.

After my aunt's death, my home life deteriorated. My father always had an anger problem and an addiction to alcohol and other drugs. His behavior got worse and the fighting between my parents grew more severe. His violence grew more severe.

After my grandfather's death, my father left my mother and I. My whole life, I had always shown signs of mental illness, like my father, but my parents always turned a blind eye. It wasn't until in the 8th grade, when my school forcibly hospitalized me for suicide ideation and intention, that my mother recognized my illness.

For as long as I can remember, I always feared people. I could never interact with others. I felt much safer in my head, with my imaginary friends. My father would scream at me until I broke down into tears when he witnessed my anxiety. Then he would scream some more and humiliate me for being worthless.

Once I hit middle school, and after I was abandoned by my father, my anxiety became coupled with depression. I occasionally cut myself, but would often fantasize about suicide. I only rarely met with my fathet during this time. I was diagnosed with anxiety, PTSD, OCD, and most importantly, bipolar disorder.

My sophomore year, my father committed suicide. I blamed myself for ignoring his calls. I could've saved him. But I didn't, and now he's gone.

I began cutting dozens of times every day. My friends left me, one by one. The bullying increased. My once flawless grades slowly grew less impressive. My first non-A grade occurred this year, my junior year. A C in calculus.

I have accepted how worthless I am. I was a child prodigy in academics, writing, and acting. Now my grades are slipping, my works of literature hidden from the world, and my days on the stage forgotten. My mother urges me to be perfect like I was, but I can't. Kids at school see the self harm scars on my arms, legs, neck, face, chest, and they avoid me or humiliate me. Teachers verbally abuse me given the chance, knowing I won't fight back.

I'm alone. No friends, my family either dead or moved away. I can't live up to my own harsh standards. The voice in my head will never let me forget I'm not good enough. Not even for my own father. I'm seeing a psychiatrist, but years of that have led me here. Even my own fantasies have turned dark.

I have been hoarding one of my medications. They are an anti psychotic. I think I may take them all tonight and end it all. Or maybe, for a quicker end, I will tie a rope to a bridge, then around my neck, and jump.

After all, I lack a future. I can't focus on anything, so I struggle to get things done. I have no motivation to do anything other than lie in bed. No career would ever tolerate someone as worthless as myself. No one can even give me a reason to live. My future? Nonexistent. My father wouldn't want this? He put a shotgun to his head and pulled the trigger. Why should he get any say? I do miss him a lot, despite all he did to me. I have a better chance of seeing him if I'm dead.

I guess the question is why am I posting this instead of taking the pills. I would say that's because some part of me still wants to fight and pursue my ambitions.

On June 15, 2020; or at least around that time frame, I will kill myself. I’m not looking to be convinced otherwise nor am I looking for help. I can’t be helped; it’s too late to save me. So, Why this date? Because on June 15, 2019; I betrayed and lied to my best friend. A person who I thought the world of and would do anything for. I saw them beyond just a friend. But family, and so did she. I’ve never felt such genuine love or a genuine sense of bond. And I betrayed her and *I did so willingly* ... --- .-. .-. -.--

I made a mistake; but one that could’ve been fixed. One that could’ve been forgiven. But instead of admitting what I did, I lied. Not once, Not twice. But several times, and I kept digging a hole that would eventually be too deep to climb out of. Worse still, I dragged others into it. All the while, she kept trying, she kept tying to get me to tell the truth. She wanted the truth, she wanted to help. She didn’t want to give up on me, but at every instance; I gave her no fucking choice          .

I’m fucked up, completely broken. I’m irredeemable, all the self-harm I ever did, the cutting, the smoking, the drinking, the fucking overdoses.. Nothing will compare to the self-harm I did by lying and betraying her, purposely cutting her out of my life. I just push people away, because I hate myself and I believe that I deserve that isolation. My depression has corrupted me so bad that everything I do is in service to the plan. But I’m at a weird place in my life, where I finally realize that it’s this illness that is forcing me; corrupting me to do this but I’m so far gone that I can’t do anything to stop it. 

And I’m so filled with regret, and remorse that I’m finally done. If my depression wants to kill me so fucking bad, so be it. But this time, no pussyfooting around it. It’s time to do it right. I’ve been doing research on overdosing, understanding the chemical intricacies and how best to go about it. And I won’t go into deep details because that breaks Rule 1.b – and while I want to kill myself, I don’t want to provide anyone with information, I don’t want to be the reason someone else kills themselves. 

And it takes time to stockpile without getting noticed. 

Depression is a disease, a corrosive illness. Like cancer, it eats you from the inside out. But unlike cancer; *it corrupts you.* If left unabated; it will slowly consume your thoughts and turn you into something you think you’re not. 

You’ll subconsciously and without really realizing push people away. You’ll hurt them, and in turn hurt yourself. All for one fucking purpose; to finally isolate yourself enough that you’ll finally cave in and kill yourself. That’s where I find myself. At the point where I can see how all of this works but be so fucking broken and corrupted that I can’t leave this place. To know that the only reason you’re suicidal is because of this illness but also being unable to fucking fight because it’s too late; It’s like knowing you’re being brainwashed but you’re too far gone to do anything about it 

&gt;You hurt someone, You betray someone, You're not you anymore. It's the illness, you tell yourself. You'll think it's the illness corrupting you, changing you. But then you wake up the next morning and you're still you. You realize, it was you all along. You just didn't know.  


Come June 2020; I will probably make an updated post. More details and less vague bullshit. Just for now, I’d like to write why I’m planning to do kill myself. Maybe someone out there will relate and maybe it won’t be too late for them as it is for me. 

Does anything I’ve written make any sense? Probably not, I’ve written too many drafts for this. Nothing makes any sense. Either way, doesn't really matter..","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;.. .----. --&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll subconsciously and without really realizing push people away. You’ll hurt them, and in turn hurt yourself. All for one fucking purpose; to finally isolate yourself enough that you’ll finally cave in and kill yourself. That’s where I find myself. At the point where I can see how all of this works but be so fucking broken and corrupted that I can’t leave this place. To know that the only reason you’re suicidal is because of this illness but also being unable to fucking fight because it’s too late; It’s like knowing you’re being brainwashed but you’re too far gone to do anything about it &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You hurt someone, You betray someone, You&amp;#39;re not you anymore. It&amp;#39;s the illness, you tell yourself. You&amp;#39;ll think it&amp;#39;s the illness corrupting you, changing you. But then you wake up the next morning and you&amp;#39;re still you. You realize, it was you all along. You just didn&amp;#39;t know.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come June 2020; I will probably make an updated post. More details and less vague bullshit. Just for now, I’d like to write why I’m planning to do kill myself. Maybe someone out there will relate and maybe it won’t be too late for them as it is for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anything I’ve written make any sense? Probably not, I’ve written too many drafts for this. Nothing makes any sense. Either way, doesn&amp;#39;t really matter..&lt;/p&gt;

I do not expect anyone to read it all. I just have not been able to tell anyone the full story. To be honest, there's a million smaller details I'm leaving out (I'm adding this after the main body was completed), but it's all the major points. I just have to get it all down and throw it out there, to the shapeless face of the combined anyone but no-one.

It started early in 2018.

First, in late January, my friend of 20+ years and constant roommate of about 15 years said he was moving out. Sad as this was, it made perfect sense. He had been practically living at his girlfriend's place for the past year. She has kids and wanted to move into an actual house, and it make perfect sense for them to pull the trigger and finally start cohabiting. Plus, I was in school and I had been in the habit of paying for all of the semester's rent (his and mine) with my financial aid, then he would pay more over the summer... with the spring semester about to start, I could afford to live alone until May giving me ample time to find a new roommate. So again, sad, but only in a ""adulting sucks/end of an era"" sort of way, but in the end not even approaching *bad*.

Then in early February I found out I was losing roughly half of my financial aid. Basically, I had enough to ""afford school,"" tuition, books, etc., but with zero left over for food, rent, utilities, or anything like that... especially not 100% of it, as I was suddenly responsible for. BTW, Yes, I have a job, but while in school I could only work weekends and - trust me, I ran the numbers - there was just no way in hell I could do it. So I spent a couple of frantic weeks trying to find a quick solution; more loans, obscure financial aid sources, a quick roommate, a night-time job that wouldn't jeopardize my GPA, anything... found some, but not nearly enough. And I was on a time crunch, I was registered for that semester, so if I couldn't find a way to attend classes and pay for everything else, I would have to unregister, which you can only do very early in the semester. Otherwise it would really negatively affect my standing (all 'withdraw' W's on my record as opposed to unregistering). So I bit the bullet and canceled my college career (though I'm still try to tell myself its just ""on hold"") with only 16 credits to graduating.

After three nightmarish attempts a getting a new roommate, some clever budgeting, a little belt-tightening, and a raise and more hours from my saint of a boss, I found that I could - just barely - afford to live it the apartment on my own dime. It wasn't fun, but it bought me breathing room and time to be more discerning as I looked for a new roommate (And, for you nit-pickers out there, yes, I was also looking into just moving during all this which yielded similar results. Plus it would have meant coming up with first and last months' rent, plus security deposit, plus the hassle/cost of moving... in February... in Wisconsin). So things stabilized for a time.

In March, my best friend was murdered. My world broke.

The period of time from March till November is kind of a blur. I just know there was a lot of pain. I know that prior to this, I had routinely fulfilled the role of my friend-group's resident amateur therapist. A role that I loved being in, and found rewarding. So I can understand when everyone was just as shocked and in pain as I was that they would turn to me out of long established normalcy. I could no longer fill that role. Tempers flared, silly drama ensued, and stupid things were said and done by many out of grief, confusion, and pain... myself being one of the worst perpetrators. So I found myself suddenly very isolated. Both as a result of flared tempers and my decision not to jeopardize any of my remaining relationships until I learned how to cope better.

In November my mom went nuts. Like seriously, off the wall loony-tunes. Nigh constant panic attacks, pervasive confusion that rendered her basically an imbecile for a big stretch of this, threats upon her own life as well as her beloved animals. It was bad. She was in and out of both mental and 'regular' hospitals for months. They tried countless drugs before they finally found stuff that works... but in the meantime - though she didn't gain an outright addiction to any one drug in particular - she developed a very strong pill-fixation/dependency which put in constant risk of abusing the very medicine that was finally working for her. Finally, by early March of 2019, she was stable and starting to get her old self back. The doctors still don't know what triggered the sudden and explosive onset, but in the end she has been diagnosed with dementia (probably Alzheimer) and an ""unspecified"" form of panic disorder. Medication and therapy is working, she is improving but still noticeably cognitively and emotionally diminished, and will probably never fully recover.

During this time, I hit a rock-bottom. I really did not expect nor want to see the new year as 2018 came to an end (this was my ""suicidal ideation"" period, there was no direct intent or plan). But my mom needed me, and so did my my sister. My sister - God bless her - just is NOT good at dealing with emotional shit. To her credit, she was strong, she handled most of the paper-work/scheduling/book-keeping stuff. But she lives over two hours away and has a very hectic job that she legitimately cannot take much time off from (although I did find out that she cashed in her remaining PTO before it expired to take a week-long vacation just before the turn of the year... whatever. She was stressed too and probably needed it). So I was left as the one actually there dealing with my mom directly on a daily basis, AND playing double-duty trying to help my sister keep it together (to be shamefully honest, I did this almost entirely out of fear that I'd have to somehow figure out how to work all the shit she was doing into my schedule, not because I gave much of a shit about her... cuz, well, I was going through the exact same thing! She's my mom too!). I was still reeling from the loss of my friend (actually, I hadn't even really begun the grieving process at all... to many distractions. Too many fires that needed to be dealt with immediately), I was utterly emotionally and mentally drained, and completely isolated with no functional support for myself. In late January when my mom finally started to show real progress and seemed to be coming out of the woods, I crashed... HARD. The light at the end of the tunnel turned my thoughts immediately and irretrievably to ""Oh thank GOD! Now that that's all settled, I can finally be done with it all."" (this heralds my ""actually suicidal"" period. There is intent and I have a plan).
I should probably mention I was (Ha! I wrote ""am"" first) a psychology major. So while I am not expert, I knew a thing or two about things I should do no that things had gotten that bad. I went into therapy, got on medication, and reached out to some of the friends I hadn't previously alienated. I was also, obviously, still in regular contact with my sister. I still don't exactly what transpired (because I knew/know its a really bad idea), but somehow I found myself telling her that I was indeed suicidal.

It did not go well.

If you click on the links over to the right that tell you what NOT to do with a suicidal person... she basically did all of them. But again, bless her heart, she WANTED to help, desperately. She did her research (and occasionally listened to me), and realized what she was doing that was less than helpful. And there were many times that she was pretty damn good. I kept falling into this ever-so-dangerous trap of audacious hope, that maybe she would quit inadvertently hurting me (and I would quit lashing out in anger when she did and hurting her). But she just KEPT falling back into the habits of looking for the quick-fix, or making it about her. Strangely and quite disgustingly, for a time this actually kind of worked. A lot of the pain I felt was very much overshadowed by the ever-mounting anger. Not even remotely healthy, but it did functionally by me some time... so I guess to take what you can get.

With my sister as a constant reminder of what DOES NOT work for me, and how I should NOT be treating the people trying to help me (I told my sister I was suicidal a good month and a half or so before I let my friends know. I kept my language couched in strict term of 'depressed,' 'struggling,' 'not doing very well,' etc.), things went differently with my friends. I tried very hard to make sure they knew that my issues were not their responsibility to ""fix,"" that I knew they had their own life and stresses and I did not want them to let me add to them. I thanked them profusely whenever I could, and was sure to mention specifically the things they said or did that were particularly helpful, and tried to inform them as gently as I could when things didn't work so well... being sure not to blame them, that I knew it all came from love, just that particular action did not have the desired result. I also told them it would be very helpful for me if they were honest if I was being a burden. If they didn't have time to talk when I called/texted, or if they just really didn't feel up to it, that was completely okay. It would be much better for me if they just called/texted whenever they had a spare moment and were thinking of me.

And they listened. And slowly but surely the ""I'm sorry I'm really busy right now, could you call later?"" and the ""I'm very proud that you called, but I'm really kinda frazzled myself..."" become more and more frequent, and the the calls/texts I got from them when they were able became less and less frequent. I haven't had contact with either of them in months.

Therapy, durring this time, was going well. For a while my therapist was working directly with my sister, and she even came up for a joint session. It was a bit soured when - I shit you not - the ENTIRE session was focused on how *I* could communicate better with *her.* To be fair, I was absolutely doing many things wrong, and I was very keen to work on that. But for fuck's sake! Could we maybe save focusing on the faults and failures of the suicidal person for the SECOND session? 

I told my sister I could no longer talk to her when, in March, she told me that she wasn't willing to take time off and come up for that second session unless I could give her some ""guarantee that we will make progress.""

I stopped seeing my therapist in April when, as the first real advice she gave on what steps I could start taking (up until then I had really just been telling the story of the past year-and-a-half), she suggested I: 1) go outside more (fuckin' DUH! Also I don't have a car, so as the weather improved that's just gonna happen naturally, which she knew), and 2) call my sister. Again, this was her first shot out the gate... after months of telling her basically everything you've read up to this point.

Life threw me a bit of a bone in May when I was subpoenaed to be a witness in the trial on the person who had killed my friend. To my horror, I had nearly forgotten all about it. For that alone I could forestall ending my life and get through the trial. I owe my friend that much and so much more.

The the trial got delayed until October. So I've been living in a state of limbo, waiting for that one last duty to be fulfilled, and then I can go. Though I'm loath to even put such tiny, fragile, thoughts into words... I'm almost hopeful. The trial could be a catharsis, a closure, a turning point. It might give me a new avenue to start talking about I'm going through that doesn't hurt those I'm talking to. I know the trial isn't about me, and that's a relief in many ways. I can use something bigger and beyond myself to finally start dealing with myself in a way that isn't so damn personal and so fraught with danger and jagged edges

In late September, my landlord sold the property I live in. The new owners are opting not to take on my lease, and instead renovate and then charge more rent. I am be out of the apartment by the end of October... functionally evicted even though I've done nothing wrong (yes, there is a clause in my lease that make this perfectly legal). And I don't fucking care. I haven't even spent a moment looking for another place. I know I should. The anxiety of what the fuck I'm gonna do is definitely building. But every time I swear I'm gonna sit down and do it, I don't. Not once. Oh well.

The trial started last week. They're allowing cameras in the court room and it's all this little Podunk town can talk about. Holy shit! The number of ""friends"" that I have not spoken to in months in some cases, over a year in others that are calling out of the blue to ask ""Hey. How are you holding up?"" (To which I answer ""Oh. I'm fine. Nervous and stressed out, of course, but glad to be playing my part.""), before they invariably want to hear all the gory details, or go over the gory details they just saw on the news, or give me their impression of how the various lawyers or doing, or give me their theory as to ""what really happened,"" with glee and bloodthirstiness that is as disgusting as it is hurtful and insensitive. Thankfully I'm under sequester and cannot talk to others about the trial, so I can shut that down real quick.

My mom has become obsessed with it, and no matter how many time I have told her I CANNOT LEGALLY TALK ABOUT IT... TO ANYONE she just still keeps calling, and calling, and calling. Every time its with the pretext of ""No, really. I just want to know how you're doing."" And every time I tell her I'm not doing well at all, I'm really in bad shape. And I get to talk for - literally, I've timed it, it got that predictable - at *most* two minutes. Then she's off to the races going right into trial. She guilt trips me, pointing out she just has no-one else to talk to, and I'm right there, and it's all she can think about, and she just wants to get a few things of her chest, and she wants just ask me a *few* questions... often she'll just start talking about it (I'm also legally forbidden to learn about the trial, by the by, so I'm not allowed to hear it... and she knows this). EVERY FUCKING DAY since the trial started, most days multiple times a day. And when I yet again ""I can't do this. I will NOT jeopardize the case, not even for you."" She gets so sad and angry. ""They'll never find out."" ""I just really need to talk about this with *someone*."" Liar. She's mentioned talking about it with both her friends and my sister. When I reminder her of this fact, then it's ""But I just *have* to ask you a few questions."" Or, the real kick to the soul, ""You *need* to talk about this, you're to taking it well and I know it.""

I've stopped taking her calls as of earlier today.

I feel terrible about cutting her off like that. She loves me and, if she could stop, she would. All of her behavior is because he ordeal has left her diminished. Moreover, she lives with the torment of *knowing* she's diminished... which has been hell for her. I want to still be there for her in that regard, but I just fucking can't. Plus, I know this makes me a shit person but, in many ways: fuck her. She has her friends and my sister. That's more than me.

I'll squat here for as long as I can, and then be homeless for a bit if need be. I exist now only to get through the trial, do my duty for my friend. I'll also wait out a small grace period after the trial to avoid any gossip that my suicide cast some sort of doubt over the verdict... it's a slam-dunk, so pretty damn sure it'll be a conviction... don't want them thinking I feel guilty over hiding some dark truth (Small town. That shit happens). Being homeless for a while should actually go a long way to cement that, so I guess that's a plus.

Other than that though, I'm fucking done. All over but for the shouting.

Thank you for getting this far. I just wanted to throw a record of this out there somewhere.

When it's over, if this post ever comes to mind, please think well of me if you can.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very long. I do not expect anyone to read it all. I just have not been able to tell anyone the full story. To be honest, there&amp;#39;s a million smaller details I&amp;#39;m leaving out (I&amp;#39;m adding this after the main body was completed), but it&amp;#39;s all the major points. I just have to get it all down and throw it out there, to the shapeless face of the combined anyone but no-one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started early in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, in late January, my friend of 20+ years and constant roommate of about 15 years said he was moving out. Sad as this was, it made perfect sense. He had been practically living at his girlfriend&amp;#39;s place for the past year. She has kids and wanted to move into an actual house, and it make perfect sense for them to pull the trigger and finally start cohabiting. Plus, I was in school and I had been in the habit of paying for all of the semester&amp;#39;s rent (his and mine) with my financial aid, then he would pay more over the summer... with the spring semester about to start, I could afford to live alone until May giving me ample time to find a new roommate. So again, sad, but only in a &amp;quot;adulting sucks/end of an era&amp;quot; sort of way, but in the end not even approaching &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in early February I found out I was losing roughly half of my financial aid. Basically, I had enough to &amp;quot;afford school,&amp;quot; tuition, books, etc., but with zero left over for food, rent, utilities, or anything like that... especially not 100% of it, as I was suddenly responsible for. BTW, Yes, I have a job, but while in school I could only work weekends and - trust me, I ran the numbers - there was just no way in hell I could do it. So I spent a couple of frantic weeks trying to find a quick solution; more loans, obscure financial aid sources, a quick roommate, a night-time job that wouldn&amp;#39;t jeopardize my GPA, anything... found some, but not nearly enough. And I was on a time crunch, I was registered for that semester, so if I couldn&amp;#39;t find a way to attend classes and pay for everything else, I would have to unregister, which you can only do very early in the semester. Otherwise it would really negatively affect my standing (all &amp;#39;withdraw&amp;#39; W&amp;#39;s on my record as opposed to unregistering). So I bit the bullet and canceled my college career (though I&amp;#39;m still try to tell myself its just &amp;quot;on hold&amp;quot;) with only 16 credits to graduating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three nightmarish attempts a getting a new roommate, some clever budgeting, a little belt-tightening, and a raise and more hours from my saint of a boss, I found that I could - just barely - afford to live it the apartment on my own dime. It wasn&amp;#39;t fun, but it bought me breathing room and time to be more discerning as I looked for a new roommate (And, for you nit-pickers out there, yes, I was also looking into just moving during all this which yielded similar results. Plus it would have meant coming up with first and last months&amp;#39; rent, plus security deposit, plus the hassle/cost of moving... in February... in Wisconsin). So things stabilized for a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, my best friend was murdered. My world broke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The period of time from March till November is kind of a blur. I just know there was a lot of pain. I know that prior to this, I had routinely fulfilled the role of my friend-group&amp;#39;s resident amateur therapist. A role that I loved being in, and found rewarding. So I can understand when everyone was just as shocked and in pain as I was that they would turn to me out of long established normalcy. I could no longer fill that role. Tempers flared, silly drama ensued, and stupid things were said and done by many out of grief, confusion, and pain... myself being one of the worst perpetrators. So I found myself suddenly very isolated. Both as a result of flared tempers and my decision not to jeopardize any of my remaining relationships until I learned how to cope better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November my mom went nuts. Like seriously, off the wall loony-tunes. Nigh constant panic attacks, pervasive confusion that rendered her basically an imbecile for a big stretch of this, threats upon her own life as well as her beloved animals. It was bad. She was in and out of both mental and &amp;#39;regular&amp;#39; hospitals for months. They tried countless drugs before they finally found stuff that works... but in the meantime - though she didn&amp;#39;t gain an outright addiction to any one drug in particular - she developed a very strong pill-fixation/dependency which put in constant risk of abusing the very medicine that was finally working for her. Finally, by early March of 2019, she was stable and starting to get her old self back. The doctors still don&amp;#39;t know what triggered the sudden and explosive onset, but in the end she has been diagnosed with dementia (probably Alzheimer) and an &amp;quot;unspecified&amp;quot; form of panic disorder. Medication and therapy is working, she is improving but still noticeably cognitively and emotionally diminished, and will probably never fully recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time, I hit a rock-bottom. I really did not expect nor want to see the new year as 2018 came to an end (this was my &amp;quot;suicidal ideation&amp;quot; period, there was no direct intent or plan). But my mom needed me, and so did my my sister. My sister - God bless her - just is NOT good at dealing with emotional shit. To her credit, she was strong, she handled most of the paper-work/scheduling/book-keeping stuff. But she lives over two hours away and has a very hectic job that she legitimately cannot take much time off from (although I did find out that she cashed in her remaining PTO before it expired to take a week-long vacation just before the turn of the year... whatever. She was stressed too and probably needed it). So I was left as the one actually there dealing with my mom directly on a daily basis, AND playing double-duty trying to help my sister keep it together (to be shamefully honest, I did this almost entirely out of fear that I&amp;#39;d have to somehow figure out how to work all the shit she was doing into my schedule, not because I gave much of a shit about her... cuz, well, I was going through the exact same thing! She&amp;#39;s my mom too!). I was still reeling from the loss of my friend (actually, I hadn&amp;#39;t even really begun the grieving process at all... to many distractions. Too many fires that needed to be dealt with immediately), I was utterly emotionally and mentally drained, and completely isolated with no functional support for myself. In late January when my mom finally started to show real progress and seemed to be coming out of the woods, I crashed... HARD. The light at the end of the tunnel turned my thoughts immediately and irretrievably to &amp;quot;Oh thank GOD! Now that that&amp;#39;s all settled, I can finally be done with it all.&amp;quot; (this heralds my &amp;quot;actually suicidal&amp;quot; period. There is intent and I have a plan).
I should probably mention I was (Ha! I wrote &amp;quot;am&amp;quot; first) a psychology major. So while I am not expert, I knew a thing or two about things I should do no that things had gotten that bad. I went into therapy, got on medication, and reached out to some of the friends I hadn&amp;#39;t previously alienated. I was also, obviously, still in regular contact with my sister. I still don&amp;#39;t exactly what transpired (because I knew/know its a really bad idea), but somehow I found myself telling her that I was indeed suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did not go well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you click on the links over to the right that tell you what NOT to do with a suicidal person... she basically did all of them. But again, bless her heart, she WANTED to help, desperately. She did her research (and occasionally listened to me), and realized what she was doing that was less than helpful. And there were many times that she was pretty damn good. I kept falling into this ever-so-dangerous trap of audacious hope, that maybe she would quit inadvertently hurting me (and I would quit lashing out in anger when she did and hurting her). But she just KEPT falling back into the habits of looking for the quick-fix, or making it about her. Strangely and quite disgustingly, for a time this actually kind of worked. A lot of the pain I felt was very much overshadowed by the ever-mounting anger. Not even remotely healthy, but it did functionally by me some time... so I guess to take what you can get.&lt;/p&gt;

Ever since I was really young, my dad has always been abusive. My grandma has told me multiple times about when I was only about 2 months old and he almost hit me for throwing up. When I was 7, my father hit my head multiple times with the home phone because I messed up an assignment. When I was 10, he slapped me, which caused a nose bleed, only to hit me again because I was getting blood everywhere (he wouldn't let me leave the room to clean up). Since fifth grade, he's no longer been violent to me, and it's only because he got his second child abuse strike, the first was when I was in third grade. However he stills goes for verbal attacks. 

My mom has essentially given up on him. We're just waiting until my younger brother is old enough, another 6 years. She lets me do things I want to do know without making me ask him for permission. Last year I decided to join color guard. He was not happy with the decision. He called it ""dancing monkeys for other people's entertainment rather than for yourself"". Every time I had to ask him for a ride home, he always reminded me about how useless I am. ""If you weren't my daughter, I would've let you die"". Since then I've done my best to not get rides from him. Asking friends for rides or waiting an extra hour for my mom. 

A couple of weeks ago, my dad asked me how to return something on Amazon. I showed him how to do it but apparently I was doing it too fast and he got mad. Told me that I always do things impulsively and need to slow down so that he can do it by himself in the picture. In the end , he called me useless and said he would just wait for my older brother to come home and do it. And so my brother did. Showed how my dad to it in less than 5 minutes. The exact same steps that I did.

When I came down to eat dinner after staying in my bedroom doing HW all day, he yelled at me for sleeping all day, being useless, and never getting anything done. When my brother did the same thing, my dad got annoyed, but he didn't say anything.  

Once when my mom was on the phone with a family friend, she left the phone on speaker and I heard the family friend say, ""you know, [my name] is [my father's name] favorite child"". 

Really? 

I'm so tired of feeling useless. And crying. And wanted to die. People tell me that I'm not a shitty person, but it's hard not to believe it when it's what I hear everyday. There's not been a SINGLE fucking day where he hasn't picked a fight. Sometimes when I do feel good, I feel selfish because immediately I shut myself down. There's no way I'm pretty. There's no way I'm smart. There's no way anyone would want to associate with me. It's affected everything in my life, but I can't change it until I'm away from here. 2 years. 

The people I used to confide in are now gone. The first was toxic. I'm glad I left. The second I don't know how I feel about them anymore (because of stuff they did this year), but they were tired of shouldering everyone's problems, so I stopped talking to them about stuff. Screaming/whispering to the wall, hitting myself in the head with a textbook, scratching, and crying have been my coping method for the last year and I'm tired.

tl;dr I want to die and I'm tired of talking to a wall. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. Let's hope I somehow manage to make it through two more years of this shit. Ya yeet.

So my little sister who is technically my cousin my family is adopting is 10 years old and has verbally said she wants to commit suicide. Brief version, a month ago my mom took H to the therapist for an assessment check and H revealed that she has had suicidal thoughts and had an active plan in place. We take her to the hospital and she gets checked in for a week. Fast forward, now she’s on anti depressants and has a therapist. There have been no active incidents since then. 
I (24) F haven’t visited the family in a while. I’m visiting this weekend and everything seems to be fine.  H is doing well and her, my mom and I have been running errands and stuff. My mom after H went to the hospital, they both decided a therapy dog would be good. H got a puppy that is a little wild against my mom saying to get a more mellow dog. H insisted on this one and my mom agreed and told her it’s her dog and responsibility since the dogs purpose is to help H heel and give her love to something. 
Here’s my problem. 
H and i are making bracelets in her room when my mom calls H outside to watch her dog. H is mad and wants to keep doing bracelets. My mom tells her she needs to make sure her dog is ok outside. 30 min pass and I go outside and it’s chaos. H is now threatening to kill herself and is crying hysterically. Apparently the dog is too much. 
I honestly think she’s using it (at least this time) as an excuse bc she was mad about watching the dog instead of making bracelets and she wants attention. 
I feel bad for thinking that but also know she can be very dramatic. And now my mom is on the phone with a counselor and H is coloring in her room. 
Any advice on how to handle this?? I’m not trying to invalidate her feelings but it does feel a little convenient to me that bc she didn’t get her way she threatened suicide and now that attention is on her, she’s coloring in her room.

My friend in this uses they/ them pronouns.

As the title says, I forced my best friend into an involuntary psychiatric stay, on Thursday night. My heart hurt so much doing so. 

Their depression has worsened so much over the past month, and they’ve coped by staying with either me or a mutual friend of ours when it gets bad. Usually the other friend is where they stay because she lives off-campus from where we go to school. Thursday, they asked to stay in my room, and I knew in my gut there was something different about the request. Normally, I would’ve just let them into my room, tried to get them food, and let them just know I was there. I let them in, and originally went and laid down for the night, as they were insistent that they just wanted sleep. They messaged me suddenly that they had already taken half a bottle of prescription pills. They insisted that it wasn’t a fatal dose at all, but might cause issues. They said that they were considering taking themselves to the ER, that they might actually hurt themselves. They’ve never said that, not even during a separate attempt.

I’ve only ever seen the look I saw on their face that night two other times: the last two times they attempted suicide. They were actively self harming (head banging and picking at scars) on my couch. They have NEVER truly self harmed in front of me. They were so incredibly lost and hopeless.

I demanded that they get out of bed and I would take us to go get food. I brought my service dog with us. I imagined taking them to get food and trying to talk to them, trying to determine if they did need to go. I’ve been hospitalized: it is definitely my very last resort. 

I got them into my car, and they curled up in a blanket with their headphones on. As I drove, they began self harming again. I realized immediately I nor anyone I know was equipped to deal with such severe suicidal intent. 

It broke my heart, but instead of a restaurant, I pulled into an ER. They freaked out, but very weakly. I knew at that moment I couldn’t back down, and that they needed major intensive care. I was the one who walked them thru the checkin process, spoke for them, asserted their pronouns and right to be respected as a non-binary person with the hospital staff. They were taken back.

I called our mutual friend to come get my car from parking. Instead, she took over the situation, butting me out completely. She is now telling everyone who can listen that I overreacted and that they shouldn’t be in the psych hospital. She also says that I wasn’t there for them as a friend should’ve been, that I should’ve just talked to them.

My friends parents drove here from another state, after initially my friend tried keeping it from them. Their a Latin family, and I don’t imagine this going well.

I hate everything that is happening with this situation. I was so damn certain that I made the decision, but now I don’t even know. I don’t know if my friend will ever forgive me. I don’t know that I can ever forgive myself if this was the wrong decision.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TW: forced hospitalization, suicidal intent, suicide attempt&lt;/p&gt;

I'm an ugly woman. I was only useful to anyone when I was 13, and would show off my body to grown men. I was ugly, and everyone my age always gravitated away from me. I don't know why they wouldn't. Weird brown chick with a dead mom, poor trailer trash, an awkward, unfeminine beast.

Now I'm 18 and fat, with a shitty GPA, and a trail of failed online relationships behind me, all people I've manipulated, cheated on or hurt somehow. I graduate soon but I just don't want to live. I don't deserve it. I had no childhood, no adolescence. No foundation. I don't want to grow up.

I'm a wet hoarder (hoarding trash, even less hygienic, attracting bugs and allergens) and I'm fucking disgusting. I lost 25lbs last year but gained most back after May's psych meds, even though I quickly discontinued them.

I can't die like this. So I'm going to fast for atleast 100hrs, clean up my hoard, and try to make myself less appalling. Then I'm going to take all those psych meds I have leftover, and finally have a respectable overdose. 

It's kind of exciting though. Life is like a dream. It's going to end soon. So I'm going to let myself pretend sometimes that I'm a Person, that I'm not an evil ugly cunt who deserves death.

I checked the Samaritans website to see if I was really suicidal and all the things they listed as risk worthy is how ive felt for weeks. Years. Ive always found suicide a relaxing thought.

I dont want to waste anyones time. I really dont like living. At least right now. I feel like i dont want to die cause i have loved ones i dont want to hurt. I find existing uncomfortable. Everything I think is stupid, everything i say is asinine, everything i do is wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked the Samaritans website to see if I was really suicidal and all the things they listed as risk worthy is how ive felt for weeks. Years. Ive always found suicide a relaxing thought.  &lt;/p&gt;

Also my brother went to the hospital and they tried to diagnose him with psychosis simply because he was praying a lot. He doesn't have psychosis. He's just really fucking religious...

My mom is so fucking concerned with her own emotions. I have a friend that I fell out of contact with for about a year because he was struggling with an ED and he ended up in the hospital. She asked about him and I said that all I knew about the ED was that he was a bit irritated that people were so on him about eating because he was fine. I don't know if I believed it. I'm not sure. But I understood, and I was empathetic. I mean, I can't begin to imagine the shit he's gone through.

I told my mom this and she called me a fucking enabler. Because I was empathetic. She said that I should've said, ""gee, don't you fucking realize how hard it was on your parents??"" Like yeah, that's what someone in that state wants to hear. Not ""God, that sucks, and I'm here if you need to talk."" No, he wants to hear about something that's gonna make him feel even more shitty. 

And that's how it is. She always cares about how these issues affect the parents, or her, or my dad. Never the child. Never me. She never thinks about how shit I must feel sitting down here thinking about hanging myself. She thinks about shitty she feels that she has a suicidal child. 

In the car, during that conversation, she also mocked me and laughed at me when I said that she was abrasive and rude and arrogant. She can't take any fucking criticism, I fucking swear. Her response was, ""Well you are, too."" So I said, ""Yeah, but at least I'm fucking aware of it and can understand where people are coming from when they get annoyed with me. At least I'm trying to be better."" 

Last time I checked I don't fucking laugh at people who are annoyed at me. I don't mock them. I'm not a childish bitch.

That shut her the fuck up, but I'm still fucking pissed.

Humans are social creatures, do you know what happens to someone who has been deprived of that for all their life? Someone not with a few friends, but someone utterly alone.
You go cold inside, cynical, judgmental and negative.
Until it speed and rips its way through your walls.
Yeah, it’s feeling everything bottled up spew out and spill. It’s you trying to hold your tears on a bus or blaming it on allergies. It’s you saying you had an accident cutting vegetables and no one questioning it. It’s hell “en boucle” inside your head.

If you look at my post history I made a post about my sister. It's getting so much worse. I left for the day, just the day, and she's mad. She's belittling me and treating me like an I'll behaved child. 


It's suffocating. 



I started to self harm again, after 8 years, after losing my mom, my dad, my grandma, my sister, I lived through an abusive relationship, all without self harming. 



But I started again. The goal isn't to die, it's to feel something real, not the pain inside. 


Even then, the thoughts. The thoughts of just disappearing are so fucking strong. If I'm a failure, a disappointment, a burden, then why not just solve all the problems and remove myself from the equation? 


I'm so scared. I don't know how long I can keep talking myself off the edge. I spent three hours laying on the bathroom floor crying because I wanted to end it, and continuing to breath just caused so much pain. 


I want it to stop. I want to run disappear. Help me. Help me please. I can't escape myself, I can't escape my situation. J want to die. Please. Help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on the edge and I just.. I don&amp;#39;t know where to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at my post history I made a post about my sister. It&amp;#39;s getting so much worse. I left for the day, just the day, and she&amp;#39;s mad. She&amp;#39;s belittling me and treating me like an I&amp;#39;ll behaved child. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s suffocating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to self harm again, after 8 years, after losing my mom, my dad, my grandma, my sister, I lived through an abusive relationship, all without self harming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I started again. The goal isn&amp;#39;t to die, it&amp;#39;s to feel something real, not the pain inside. &lt;/p&gt;

I want to just die, leave actually. I never want to live on this godforsaken rock ever again and if there is such a thing as reincarnation: I’d like to live in much better world. 

I’ve been struggling with porn addiction, Asperger’s/autism, ocd, financial problems, and working several jobs. I’m also trying to write my novels.  

For the past month I’ve been writing farewell letters and requests along with some eff-yous to my Church due to what’s going on. Along with my birth mother. 

She suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and yelled at me a lot. She lied to me about what my Dad’s family did to her and her own father. She accused me of being gay (I’m straight). She accused me of spying on her for the Sherriff’s office and my stepmother and intentionally misspells her name. I hate thinking of her voice and certain words still resonate with me. She once called my cowering in front of her ‘pathetic’. She has been to mental hospitals but she always came back out and the nightmare continues. 
In a way she started my ocd and anxiety along with malformation me. After being taken by CPS, we finally got to be with our Dad, but I’ll admit that I was a bit of a jerk to my stepmother. I’m in touch with my grandmother but I keep thinking about how hypocritical and complex it all is to talk to my mom’s mom. 

Dad’s side says she (my grandmother) is an enabler. I keep trying to forgive her but I can’t. Tried therapy, failed to make appointments because I’m either tired, forgot or worked that day. Work wise I have less hours on one job and on the other I just started doing a stable fixed schedule. Previous job before that last one, they didn’t increase my pay rate until almost a year later. 

I keep fantasizing while I walk about jumping off of bridges or off overpasses to the interstate. I’ve thought about slicing my own throat with knives or scissors. 

I can’t always make rent with one job or both( before ending the pay rate-less job) and I wound up eating out or giving money to the homeless. 

I have around ten or twelve letters all in envelopes and hidden for when I decide it finally happens. Not only that but I can’t get a girlfriend. It’s never happened to me as an adult. Suffice to say: I’m an adult and I’m still a virgin! If there is a god then he owes me one hell of an explanation and even bigger consolation/compensation for my troubles because I’m done suffering and offering them up. Done! I’ve gone to pray to Mary after work for a good few weeks straight. Nada!  My church is systematically corrupt with folks playing power games with doctrine and even the faithful to usurp a so-called Holy  office and take it for themselves. ‘Gates of hell won’t stand against it’my ass!  

If there’s anything I’m owed: it’s a stable childhood, great work environment a better faith if there ever was any as I’m done with all these god damned rules and regulations. I’m also owed a good love life and a Stable mentality, being neurotypical ( I’m autistic), some time in the military ( failed to pass MEPs due to hearing loss, weight , and being colorblind, plus not in a good state of mental health. I’m also owed a better world. 
If anyone raises objections as to what I’m owed, that’s fine.

We promised each other we'll always be there for each other. But about a month ago she got a real boyfriend, someone who's really there for her and is kind too as she tells me.

But my own selfish emotions and the fact that I always felt alone (I don't have friends, I was totally dependant on her) kept coming in between and so I told her I wanted to leave.

She didn't want me to leave and she's very stubborn so she tried really hard to stop me but eventually she blocked me and told me I'll never hear from her again. I still love her and even though she doesn't understand now, I think I made the right decision as I would have only made her and myself more unhappy (been affected mentally, lost weight, keep zoning out, feeling anxious, etc.) if I stayed longer.

She's actually a really beautiful person and I don't want her to kill herself. And she depended on me too much in the last two years but since she got her boyfriend, she hasn't had much time for me. 

Did I take the right decision? Am I a terrible person? We did keep each other alive for more than 2 years but could I have done more and stayed with her even now? She does have her friends who care for her but I was always the one who got her back from the darkest places.

I wish I could just make her understand that I support her but I have to stop thinking about her too. Before she blocked me I told her she should message me whenever she feels too low or goes into her dark place. But I don't think she will.
And I'll always live in regret because I won't know if she's even alive or not.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been in a long distance relationship since more than 2 years now.

I feel like lighting again, but stronger, darker. Nothing is everything all at once but not at all.

My friends are worried about me because I keep cutting them off and just sending loads of random shit to our group chat, my mum is worried because my room is a mess. 
I’m usually so good at keeping things tidy but I’ve just let go, my life is crumbling down around me and the only light I see in front of me is Wednesdays.

I wrote 2 stories and posted this on livejournal.com. I really don’t know when and if I will crack before a year is up. I am stuck with this lease. The two stories I wrote are related to “Stargate SG-1.”  So, that’s where Cam and Daniel come from. 

I think I should be banned from reading my own books. At the same time, I’m grateful for them. Thinking of something other than roaches, spiders, mice and lizards. Thinking of something other than financial problems and having to live in this hellhole for a year. Thinking of Daniel and Cam is a lot better, than thinking of those things. 

I guess that’s why I don’t care about my books becoming popular or making any money. It distracts me from the realities of how bad my life is. So, I’ll continue not to care. I’ll continue to make more chapters even, if no one is interested. It’s better than thinking about how black my life is and how there’s no light, in the end of the tunnel. At least, not for a year. It’s gonna be a miracle, if I survive a year. 

I was working on a new chapter last night. It made me so depressed, I stopped. All I could think of, was I wish I died at 15. I would have never knew I would be kicked out of the house at 18 and my dad wouldn’t show up to my high school graduation. I wouldn’t know the first man that I would ever love, would turn me away and ask me to choose between him and God. I would have never knew that, I would be raped and abused, ruin my nose for life, be kidnapped and now, this year. Having to file for Chapter 7, being in a hellhole that has spiders, roaches, mice and lizards. Being far from everything and can’t drive. Can’t ride the regular bus, because I have cerebral palsy. Yeah, to die at 15, would have been worth it. People say life gets better. Yeah right, look at my life. It gotten worse. Way worse. If I could go back in time, I would tell my 15-year old self, “Die. I don’t care how. But mark my words, it’s better than what you will face. Life will not get better, not for you.” But I’m 22 years too late, now. 

The only light in this dark tunnel and at the entrance of this dark barrel, are my books. My imagination of something a lot better than this. I wish I appreciated where I lived before this. But, I never knew, how bad things could actually get. I will keep working on my books and hope that, I’ll survive this year. The only promise that I can make is, I’ll do my best. If people want to criticize how my books are, don’t. Just don’t read them and walk away, simple and easy. I will not change them for you. They’re MINE. Since I do not get paid to write them, the only real audience is me. But, if you must be cruel and leave a bad thing to say, just know I will ignore it. Since you’re not paying me to write for you.

I'm laying in bed crying right now with the door locked. I'm scared and i have no one in my life to vent to or to get this out of me to who I actually know at this point but i need it out there in case something goes horribly wrong through the rest of the weekend...

I invited friends over to hang out last night, after dinner the one left leaving me home with my best friend q -35f and my roommate s 29f.

I took s into my home maybe a year and a half ago now? she had been kicked out her lease for being lgbt and was at high suicide risk. well i greatly care about her and she's been pretty infatuated with me causing her to chase me pretty hard for wanting a relationship. Though o never consented to a full blown romantic relationship we ended up sleeping together and becoming fwb but the boundaries i set have been continually violated and whatever is between us is now unrecognisable to me as something I've never consented to and the lines between being a dearly loved friend/fwb/dominate to my submissive role in bed/girlfriends has become so blurred and tangled.

I've been working in therapy lately to try and figure out how to untangle myself from s but still keep her as a loved friend and essentially family because I don't have family of my own any more besides these two women, q and s. 

I had been a victim of chronic childhood rape and have been nocontact with my biological family for a year now due to feeling unsafe particularly as my parents still don't know about the rape stuff aside from that i was raped as a kid and that the preparator having been my brother, I get panic attacks/suicidal AF during family events where he may show up. Add in also being rejected by parents because of being lgbt and we've got a party down here in the South.

So now q and s are extremely drunk and Im inebriated myself on pot which gets me pretty horny so I'm in my own little world playing on my phone while they watch YouTube on the tv. 

... an aside is my cat knows I'm not well and is currently crying at the door but I'm afraid to move to let her in...

I go to the bathroom and q shouts something at me which nuked my feelings as it echoed my abuse so now any feelings of sexiness have done a 180 into feelings of extreme disgust and self hate...

I text s who has been poking me all night worried about the serious faces I've been making as i played on my phone.

s sends me a sexy picture

me (j): red, i need space for a bit

s:Okay sorry love

me:I'm going to bed. i need to be alone

s:I'm sorry J

s:I'm going to come in at some point to take my meds but I'll leave you alone. If that's what you need 

me:door is locked please no one bother me. what are your meds I'll set them out. i need isolation right now

s:J what's wrong I'm worried

me:come take them now just leave me be in the closet

me:I just need to calm down and be alone and untouched

me:no communication. just need silence in my head

me:I'm safe

this is where i move to the closet in the dark, naked as i was laying down in bed. I forgot to unlock the door though so i hear a bang as she drunkenly bypasses the door lock and some crashing sounds from the bedroom so now I'm getting scared as well.

me:please don't be angry

me:i need space I'm having a panic attack

I hear her leave the room again but quickly hear more crashing from another room. and then her back in the bedroom approaching the closet door. I'm curled up in the dark naked and trying to calm down and figure out wtf why everything is suddenly so horribly wrong when she turns on the closet light and throws the door open. I screamed afraid.

She crashes past me and is jumping up and down trying to grab something from the shelf, me crying, scared and cowering beneath her as stuff is crashing down around me from above. she pulls down the primary suicide method i have, that I've had complete in the house since my birthday last year. two bottles of chemicals that when mixed produces a deadly non painful gas.

s and I have a suicide pact after having made several attempts on our own independent of one another previously and i figured a pact would lend strength to whichever of us is the weaker one at the time so that we could make it another day because the other person wouldn't be ready to call it quits yet.

at this point I'm now crying begging her ""red"" over and over again which in the kink community means extreme emergency hard stop. I'm sobbing uncontrollably as she's screaming at me through her own tears. telling me ""we just need to mix the chemicals and we'll be good. what are you waiting for. just fucking do it. I've (s) been holding back ideation all day and have been crying nonstop to my therapist today (she had an appointment earlier that day) that I just can't do this anymore and i don't know how q and i pissed you off but I'm sorry and i fucking needed you tonight and you got pissed and fucking went to isolate yourself.""

I'm still sobbing curled up tightly shivering in fear and crying red over and over again. I start to disassociate though and feel my emotions floating away leaving me feeling hollow, a feeling I'm so used to from surviving childhood. So now with less emotions I try to diffuse the situation. Telling her i still can't be touched right now but that i hear her and I'm sorry and I just needed space and I'm scared.

She apparently hadn't seen all the texts and only got to the point where i told her to come get them. So over the next hour I'm trying to calm her down without moving from being curled up as small as i can. I get her to leave the closet without touching me and i take a minute scrambling to get dressed from within the closet as i feel vulnerable, scared and disgusted by my body. I hear her hitting herself in the bedroom at least twice.

I join her in the bedroom again not looking at her and no touching as i sit on the other side of my bed from her. I beg her and try to console her own pain with my words. she calms down and starts climbing into my bed so im forced to speak up that ""I'm sorry, but i still need to be alone tonight. I can't be touched right now... I'll give you the bed if you want it and I'll be elsewhere but i need space tonight""

She starts crying some again so i ask her to drink a 'reasonable' amount of zquil and that she'll be better when she's not drunk any more. She again starts to calm down a little bit it starts again as I stand and start moving towards the door. I have to calm her by touch. sacrificing another piece of myself and what i need in the moment for someone else and still all i can manage is putting my hand on her forehead.

I leave the bedroom, shaking from adrenaline and fear but with most of my own pain now suppressed and more of a doll throbbing as I'm well into disassociation. Q is gone... I check my phone to find she's sent an angry text about being left alone at some point during all of this and on Google maps it now shows her back at home that she must've gotten an Uber.

So I'm wired from having had red bull cocktails earlier and all the adrenaline and fear. I find and message a domestic abuse hotline which helped a lot in the moment last night though was still scared as s is just asleep still in the other room. finally I'm alright enough to try to sleep though i keep jerking wide eyed awake at every bump in the house from my nest I've made on the floor of the office. so i go to her own bed because she sure isn't using it... I lock the door and climb in bed and for the past 4 hours ive managed sleep, I've been stuck in nightmare land. ironically it's one I had the night before as well that ended up coming true in the events of the day. I woke up the other night before screaming and crying also...

The dream being that my father is chasing me around my parents house trying to get me. Me begging that i just need space, to please let me be alone for just a minute. Well what was an unrefined nightmare yesterday night, tonight was refined as fucking hell and vivid as he'd try to grab me and touch me as he got near and me screaming crying and running from place to place in the house but never able to get away...

So now I'm laying here on a giant stuffed animal caterpillar, my face hurts from crying nonstop. S texted me this message earlier in the morning.

s:I know you don't want to hear from me right now. I'm sorry about everything. I didn't see most of these texts last night. When I read isolation I was triggered and spiraled. I had been trying to repress my ideations since therapy. I hate myself for invading your space when you needed to be alone. I just wanted to die. Still do honestly. I was never angry at you I just had nothing to hold onto 

I'm scared to make any sound in case i wake her up. I've texted q now who is hurt herself because I ignored her... to her I've said:

me:i can't talk to anyone right now but i need you to know that last night's series of events have greatly hurt me badly. I'm in a lot of pain, scared and alone

me:I've managed maybe 4 hours of sleep of a constant nightmare and have been crying nonstop

so now i lay here. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to take care of myself in this moment when I'm scared of s, angry and hurt by q and disgusted by myself and in so much pain that ideation is definitely happening. I'm not safe...

tldr... I'm scared, suicidal and alone. I'm scared to say the wrong thing to my friend who I've found myself in a relationship I've never consented to. I'm afraid that she'll hurt herself and though I've put so much effort into being a survivor, i still carry a death wish and could care less about what happens to myself.

honestly i intended this to be posted on /relationships because I've had so many cries for help overlooked here before in /sw and it hurts... a lot. especially as I've a need to be seen and I just want someone to understand how fucking monumentally hard I've been trying... but because i was raped i don't belong in /relationships. :'( I'm honestly crying again and more suicidal now than before writing all this useless fucking meaningless garbage. I really should just give in","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start, I&amp;#39;m on mobile so forgive typos and wrong words. my autocorrect does weird things to what i write sometimes.

She was asleep in bed so I woke her up and she told me she took 5mg of ativan and 4 beers and was just going to sleep all day.  I found a 5 page suicide note detailing her struggle to get into a bulimia program and hoping her death would change the system.  She has been trying for over a year to get into a residential program on Medicare and nobody will take her without like 10k to 30k up front.  I snooped around a little and found all her blankets and pillows in an empty closet with a noose hanging from the door.  She is breathing fine and just sleeping over the pills right now.  I’m probably going to take her to the hospital later but this has happened before and they’ll hold her for a week then let her go and say they can’t help with getting her eating disorder treatment.  I have no idea what to do.  Healthcare is fucked.  I’m in Massachusetts.  I tried to contact Elizabeth Warren directly to no avail.  I am at a loss.

With No family No friends 
Mental health issues 
Constant suicidal thoughts DAILY
More attempts than I can honestly remember 
( three this year )
Trapped in a horrible society 
Where no one cares.
Because when your life is great why would you think about others??
Happy memories are non-existant 
And to top it all off I've genuinely suffered my whole life.. and that's not an understatement.
Was I born unlucky?
I'm starting to think so.

And before you say go and get help from a professional I've been down that route MANY TIMES
They don't care either 
What I really need is money to start a new life but I've given up on that delusional fantasy coming true.

Here is a pearl of wisdom I came up with to remember me by.

- Unity is the key that will unlock the door to a better world 

Because 
I sincerely hope one day mankind works together to end the sadness and pain people are forced to endure.

You know what the truly sad thing is?
We have enough food to feed the world 7 times over yet people starve 
We have enough resources for everyone to have suitable accommodation but people still sleep in the cold while people just walk past without so much as a glance.

The only solace in all this negativity I find is the fact I know some sort of afterlife exists.
And maybe.. just maybe next time 
I'll be one of the lucky ones.

For now I feel like going on living in a world soo dark is pointless 
When you know it doesn't have a chance of getting better. 

Let's hope I find my eternal peace soon.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a loner

Right? Someone to hug, maybe on like a park bench somewhere. Are there like prostitutes, but like just for hugging or talking to. I guess a therapist but that's kind of different, that's their job. 

Do therapists really care? That's a good question. I wonder if therapists actually care about who they're talking to or if their just clients. If a therapist has an actual suicidal person at 3:00 pm and me at 5pm and I'm like feeling lonely or empty(but not quite as suicidal as the guy at 3:00) would the therapist treat me like a waste of time. There could be a real market for prostitutes that just hug you and cuddle or something. If it was cheaper. 

Crying on to someone's shoulder sounds nice. Human interaction saves lives.

 If there was a person that was really awkward and couldn't really hold a conversation or just uncomfortable in social situations, would you just leave them? Like not want to be in a relationship with them? 

I'm never gonna lose my virginity and that sucks. But more importantly never fall in love or really be with people when I'm older. I'd that a reason to kill myself or should I just be a loner and suffer...I wonder if it would be suffering though. I could watch movies, ooohh maybe get a dog.

Does anyone have a discord, I just want someone to talk to. I want to like speak to another person even if it's not a video call that sounds nice. Maybe talk about our favorite food or something. What kind of phone do you have? What're you up to? Idk that sounds cool. There's someone else just vibing in the world somewhere. Maybe some dude just chilling in his room staring at a poster at his wall imagining if he was the lead singer in a rock band...heck yeah dude keep rocking. I'd talk to him. I wanna talk. 

Talking to yourself can get boring... technically thinking is just talking to yourself but in your head. Weird huh? I think everyone is crazy. It's kind of scary when you get really close to someone's eyes and look into their pupil they stop looking human. Like think about how everything you see is coming out of some black dot on two little balls in your head. And same with everyone else

Highschool is pretty okay. How's highschool for y'all? Or maybe, what was it like after high school? Or maybe after college? Or after retiring? So many different kinds of people could be reading this...that's kind of cool to think about, and every individual person has their own stories.  Or maybe only one person is reading this...hello! Lol I guess it's cool that you read this far...what's up? Haha. 

But just think that like all of this views on YouTube...like with millions of views, some kid in Canada just got home from hockey practice and he clicked on that same video. Maybe a 5 year old in Brazil accidentally clicked on it when he meant to watch...idk the alphabet game. Maybe a 50 in a senior center in England watched it. So many people...that's pretty cool.

here I am in my small room typing this at 1 in the morning. That's cool, maybe when you're reading this I'm asleep. Maybe while I was in the middle of typing this YOU were asleep. That's pretty neat right? What if exactly when I typed this sentence you were eating the last bite of cereal. I just blinked just now, what if I blinked exactly when you blinked. What if I just stood up when you stood up. Maybe I'm walking to my kitchen and you were too but we're like 500 miles away from each other. Cool...

But for real if you...YOU literally you the person who is reading this has a discord add me in actually trying to talk, I wasn't joking about that I want to talk to someone lol about anything I don't care. Is it weird for me to put my discord account in this post? Probably lol. Come-on I just want to talk to anyone I don't care who you think you are or you aren't or if you think you don't want to talk at all...I know you want to...lol that's kind of creepy But for real though. 

Edit: I don't know why I thought discord was the only place we could chat, literally any social media works. Maybe phone numbers but that's kind of sketch because I don't want a virus or something.

I'm exercising, eating well, seeing a dr, a psych, trying a million different meds to absolutely no gain.

I have emotional outbursts, I argue for the sake of arguing, I'm rude to my parents and the people who support me on purpose, I don't work, study, and I'm bitter, angry and hysterical all the time. I've literally gotten worse since I started treatment five months ago, and everyone keeps saying, 'hold out, life gets better', but I think I'm at the stage now where I know it doesn't, because I'll always be me, and as long as I walk this earth, it'll be my death sentence. Life was never that great of a bargaining chip anyways, so I have no idea why people always hold that card.

Literally no one wants me. A few of my friends know I have depression and I worry about them abandoning me and guess what they've done? Fucking abandoned me. Even the select few who know I'm suicidal. They never check up on me, even though all I ever did was check up on them and went so far out of my way to make sure they were ok. My friends aren't shit. They're good people, but this has happened with everyone I've ever known, so don't hit me with that, 'you just gotta find your people'. I don't have a people. I've known a lot of people. There's something as wrong with me as there is with them.

Anyone I've ever liked has turned the other way and cut off all contact with me when I even give the slightest sign of liking them. People insist I'm a good person and have good qualities but they don't see me putting down strangers on the internet, flipping off ass hole drivers just to get a rise out of them and slamming the door on my Mum who is my heart and soul when she tries to make me feel better and talk things out. 

Everyone always leaves. 

I think it's a sign. 

Not a single one of you know me or would miss me when I'm gone, and you can't bullshit your way around it to make me think otherwise. You don't know me or my life story, what I look like, what I like and don't like, and none of it matters. There's billions of people on this planet, and while you all live out your lives, I'll be rotting in the ground somewhere beneath your feet and you'll be indifferent to it by tomorrow. 

I hope there's not an afterlife, or anything that requires thinking, existing or being reborn. It's my turn to leave, and I want that exit to be permanent. I bring nothing to this world and everyone forgets me as it is when I'm alive, so watch how quickly they'll forget me when I'm dead. 

I'm fucking sick of it all and life is full of shit anyways. Who the fuck wants to work a 40 hr week, live in a consumerist, capitalist world that's destroying our wild-life and planet, be harassed by random ass holes over when you're gonna get married and have kids, almost kill yourself pushing a baby out something the size of a straw and then meander through the fifty years you have left. Life isn't special. It's not amazing. Me being born isn't significant and was never meant to happen. My parents just up and decided to have a baby and I'm the product of that decision. I just so happened to be unlucky. My parents could've had any type of kid. I could've been anyone. But I don't want to be anyone and I'm sure as hell pissed that that 'anyone' turned out to be me in the first place. Humans are selfish and self-centred, and I think it's my turn to be selfish and self-centred for once.

I'm a frigid, cold bitch and I know everyone would be better off without me, and that's not depression talking, it's the truth. I'm a horrible human-being, so I can at least fill those shoes and push my grief onto someone else because it's sure as hell killing me. Not everyone is born inherently good and no one really chooses to exist or be born in the first place at all. It's all chance and I fucking hate that I ever had a chance in the first place.

Something died inside me when I hit puberty and ten years later, it's festered into something void of healing and it's eating me from the inside out. I can never be who I was and it kills me. I've already been dead inside for ten years. Anxiety's made me lost my mind. Eating disorders have ruined my body. Panic disorder has suffocated me. And depression has broken my heart. 

I think it's time I fucking commit.

I'm a piece of shit.

I've always been.

People are just starting to notice.

People insist I&amp;#39;m a good person and have good qualities but they don&amp;#39;t see me putting down strangers on the internet, flipping off ass hole drivers just to get a rise out of them and slamming the door on my Mum who is my heart and soul when she tries to make me feel better and talk things out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone always leaves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s a sign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a single one of you know me or would miss me when I&amp;#39;m gone, and you can&amp;#39;t bullshit your way around it to make me think otherwise. You don&amp;#39;t know me or my life story, what I look like, what I like and don&amp;#39;t like, and none of it matters. There&amp;#39;s billions of people on this planet, and while you all live out your lives, I&amp;#39;ll be rotting in the ground somewhere beneath your feet and you&amp;#39;ll be indifferent to it by tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope there&amp;#39;s not an afterlife, or anything that requires thinking, existing or being reborn. It&amp;#39;s my turn to leave, and I want that exit to be permanent. I bring nothing to this world and everyone forgets me as it is when I&amp;#39;m alive, so watch how quickly they&amp;#39;ll forget me when I&amp;#39;m dead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m fucking sick of it all and life is full of shit anyways. Who the fuck wants to work a 40 hr week, live in a consumerist, capitalist world that&amp;#39;s destroying our wild-life and planet, be harassed by random ass holes over when you&amp;#39;re gonna get married and have kids, almost kill yourself pushing a baby out something the size of a straw and then meander through the fifty years you have left. Life isn&amp;#39;t special. It&amp;#39;s not amazing. Me being born isn&amp;#39;t significant and was never meant to happen. My parents just up and decided to have a baby and I&amp;#39;m the product of that decision. I just so happened to be unlucky. My parents could&amp;#39;ve had any type of kid. I could&amp;#39;ve been anyone. But I don&amp;#39;t want to be anyone and I&amp;#39;m sure as hell pissed that that &amp;#39;anyone&amp;#39; turned out to be me in the first place. Humans are selfish and self-centred, and I think it&amp;#39;s my turn to be selfish and self-centred for once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a frigid, cold bitch and I know everyone would be better off without me, and that&amp;#39;s not depression talking, it&amp;#39;s the truth. I&amp;#39;m a horrible human-being, so I can at least fill those shoes and push my grief onto someone else because it&amp;#39;s sure as hell killing me. Not everyone is born inherently good and no one really chooses to exist or be born in the first place at all. It&amp;#39;s all chance and I fucking hate that I ever had a chance in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something died inside me when I hit puberty and ten years later, it&amp;#39;s festered into something void of healing and it&amp;#39;s eating me from the inside out. I can never be who I was and it kills me. I&amp;#39;ve already been dead inside for ten years. Anxiety&amp;#39;s made me lost my mind. Eating disorders have ruined my body. Panic disorder has suffocated me. And depression has broken my heart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s time I fucking commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a piece of shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are just starting to notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to kill myself so fucking badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fucking downvote me all you want.&lt;/p&gt;

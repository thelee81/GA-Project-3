t3_dlvka1,Amxela,i ve started writing down my depressed thoughts  figured i share so i don t have to keep it to myself  it s been a rough past few days ,depression                  am   i m sitting here after quite a few shots of rum  listening to down tempo music  the thoughts in my mind are ones longing for my existence to be over  i don t want to kill myself but i wish my life was over  the stress of this semester as well as thinking that the person i ve fallen in love with is going to leave me in about a months time makes me want to not experience any more    the reoccurring thought of me hanging by my neck in my closest replays in my mind over and over again  i would never do that to myself but that thought goes through my mind countless times a day  i don t think i m a danger to myself but i simply just wish the world would take my in my sleep  i don t think i m suicidal but i just don t want to live any more  if my death was natural it would cause less pain to the people in my life  just this past tuesday            i told the girl i have feelings for that if i were to die most people wouldn t notice for a few weeks  i don t think my roommates would notice for a few days  i personally think word to my parents would take   weeks or more and to the girl i feeling for  i don t think she would hear of my passing for a month or so    the pain that plagued my depressive thoughts comes from a mixture of felling like a failure  to not wanting to let my parents down  to stress from work and classes  i wish i didn t feel this way and that s why i wish this world would just make my death an untimely one  nearly every time i go to sleep i hope that i dint wake up in the morning and that s if i go to sleep    i wish this dull nagging pain in my mind would just end so i can live my life    the only time i feel alive is when i travel or when i m with a bunch of people i care about   even then i feel like the people i care about don t have reciprocating feelings   maybe i need help                am sitting here thinking about her again  i told myself i wouldn t get played again  i wouldn t get caught up in emotions so i won t get hurt when she leaves again  we agreed we wouldn t take it to there  she started talking about how she showed me off to her family and how her friend told her she should date me  hearing all of this i caught feelings hard again  i feel her slipping further and further away and i m not sure if it s my fault  is it because i m depressed  is it because i freaked her out with how far i ve fallen for her  is it because she found someone else  someone better  i m not sure      feeling like i m losing grasp on the person i want to love in the future on top of the stress school has me going through is making it hard for me  i want to quit  i m doing poorly in most of my classes and it s onto the real world in just a few months  i m not ready for it  if i can t get out of bed to go to an hour long class how will i be able to hold a job  i want to just curl up and not exist anymore   i don t want to kill myself because i know there are people that care about me and that would devastate them but i m honestly not afraid to die  if i went to sleep tonight and didn t wake up in the morning i don t think i d be afraid of that happening  i ve gone back to not looking both ways when crossing the street in the off chance that a distracted driver helps me escape  i m not making attempts on my life nor am i planning on doing so  i am just giving up self preservation because i don t care if i die by external sources anymore    my medication helps me sleep but it doesn t fix my depression  i don t think i need something to help me sleep i need something that stops these thoughts  i need something that puts me at ease  alcohol is not a good idea because while i feel good after drinking i hate how i feel the next day  i seem more depressed  my medication for sleep also doesn t let me drink  and sometimes some days aren t that bad and i want to have fun or have a drink with my friends but i can t because of this stupid medication    as far as the girl situation goes  as much as i want to bring it up and ask her to reaffirm that nothings wrong i don t want to make a big deal out of something if it s nothing and i don t want to come across insecure  i just wish she was upfront with me  if she doesn t want to see me don t give me excuses just tell me why you d rather not  i d understand better  i don t know how you can lie to me and tell me that you are busy with homework and want to see your little brother and then go and get high with your friend  i honestly wouldn t care if you would rather go and do that just please don t lie to me  it hurts  i miss you     i just want to sit down and talk to you    i think i m codependent and in a very bad way  i feel like nothing matters and my depression is gone when she is around and when she talks to me  lately it just seems like she doesn t want to see me or talk to me and it s making the depression come on strong  i need to fix this ,depression
t3_dlvjgc,cwatson1060,how do i know i was truly laughing ,i m confused  i laugh in some classes in school or sometimes smile but i can t tell if i was really laughing or smiling or was it because i was nervous  i try to remember what i was feeling but i can t remember or don t remember feeling anything  can anyone clear this up for me ,depression
t3_dlvj4a,Gregorvitch,a rant about imposter syndrome ,imposter syndrome has hit me pretty hard lately and i m realizing how much the associated anxieties have driven my life the past year    it all started with getting a promotion i didn t want or feel qualified for    fast forward a year and a half and i quit my job because it was making me feel suicidally inadequate  now   months unemployed and considering changing my career field on a daily basis just to escape the pressure of needing to perform    it s so frustrating feeling like i ll never be good enough even though in my brief rational moments  i know i am and have succeeded in the past  i just feel like i tricked everyone  and if i never go back  they ll never realize  and i won t have to face the shame  but people are expecting me to move on to greater things while i just want to give up    i have to face old colleagues in a few social settings soon and they will ask how i m getting on   i had such bold plans and i have barely even tried to achieve them because i feel like such a fucking fake whenever i do  i don t know how to face these people  i feel like an actor who everyone secretly hates    it s spreading to all parts of my life  i m a lousy lover  a lousy friend  a lousy brother and son  they re all on to my bullshit  oh how i wish i was a bird  because most birds don t live that long  and that means i d be long dead already ,depression

t3_dlvevy,Gayboysloth,how to deal with loneliness ,i have absolutely no one to talk to  i just lay in bed all day  does anyone have some advice on how i can be at least somewhat normal  or ways to meet people  i can t take this anymore  i hate to be negative  and i don t want to bring anyone down  but this fucking sucks  i don t think things are going to get any better  life has lost all meaning to me  and i m seriously considering suicide  what do i do ,depression
t3_dlvegu,hobistar,how to go from here    ,i don t really know how to start this but i have to get these words out  eventhough it makes it worse right now because i slowly realise that this is my reality   for the past few months  since around may  june  the intensity of my  sadness  has increased and for the past few weeks my motivation isn t even there anymore  i haven t been to someone that is professionalised in this field  therefore i have never been diagnosed  furthermore i also don t want to diagnose myself only because i can make out some similarities with others that have depression   but for the last few weeks it s like i am moving forward to a turning point that i cannot return back from   i have suicidal thoughts  in particular how i could end it in a way that i am sure to not fail and kinda how i can make it the cleanest way  it may sound wierd but i don t want to have anything scattered around or be unrecognisable afterward etc    it even got to this point where i can t unterstand why people try to prevent suicide  they always preach about how there is something worth living for and how people would miss you if you were gone and how much pain they have to endure  but why is it okay to keep me here and let me endure this pain  if the only thing i dearly want right now is just to sleep  i am so tired  so badly tired that i never want to leave my bed again and just sleep in for the last time so i can finally rest  isn t it selfish of them to keep me here  eventhough i just live from day to day without even wanting  wouldn t i do a favour for someone that deserves to live  someone that knows how to get themselve together  i know some can see the good things  some can see the colours around them but for me everything seems to fade  it pains not to be happy anymore and i slowly fuck everything up  i just received a spot in a university and because of the lack of motivation i can t seem to do anything slightly related for it     all the assignments i have are just stocking up  they get more and more and the more they get  the more of a failure i feel like   at first i thought it s just being a bit depressed because around some things won t work out and that the stress resulting from this is getting to me but i am not really sure anymore    i don t even know if i should seek help  because i am so aware of it all and i am scared that no one will believe me  i don t really know how to put all of this into words  i am scared that the only thing people see is someone attention seeking or some that wants to be pitied eventhough that s the least i want  the only thing i want is to rest ,depression
t3_dlvd82,upwardoverdmountain,i am pathetic and alone,life is miserable as fuck  i have brief joys in between  until i realize the happiness i was feeling was only my mind s way of distracting myself from my reality for a moment and not because i m actually happy,depression
t3_dlvd4e,seakfruitloops,in a constant state of conflicting thoughts and feelings,i feel so lonely  pretty much all the time  it doesn t feel like i really have any friends anymore because i don t spend time with anyone outside of work  school or home  i genuinely don t have friends to do things with  the loneliness is eating me up  but i know myself  and i know that if someone came along and tried to make plans with me i would not want to follow through and i would have a very hard time putting in the effort  even though i feel like my medication is working in some ways  the loneliness is crippling and brings me to a very low place  it makes me jealous and bitter when i see other people being social and having fun with friends  i hate this so much ,depression
t3_dlvcys,averageeverydaymemer,advice,i have a friend who seems to be somewhat depressed this just seems like the best place to put it  so i wanted your advice on the matter  my friend had a sort of mental breakdown because my friend was being a dick and he started sobbing and talking about the things that stress him  would it make things worse if i sent a text telling him i m sorry as i had a part at the end but i didnt even realize the context of the conversation and thought the joke was harmless  i dont even know if it was me who did it  and just saying how hes a good guy and how i can kind of relate ,depression
t3_dlvcrb,TheFakeJoel732,i don t know if it s a act or not ,i use to be edgy  not really edgy but slightly  then i started to notice how fucking cringey it was and god have i changed so much in the past years  almost   now  i m like a complete different person    i ve been feeling not really happy or sad  just kinda nothing  i sit in my bed    hours a day and dont get out to do anything  its been like this for probably a year or so now  sometimes i feel really happy then out of nowhere just begin to cry then go back to normal  i dont know what s wrong with me  or if there even is anything wrong with me and i m just a lazy fucking piece of shit,depression
t3_dlvcjm,DiMethylHg,i don t want to keep going,i m    and have never been able to feel any romantic connection with anyone  and can t maintain friendships because i feel as if they would be better of without me  so now i just sit here alone not talking to anyone and wanting to end it all ,depression
t3_dlvc4v,abbytheunbearable,the endless cycle,it never really seems to get better for me  i do all these things i m told to do  i eat well  i try to socialize  i go to a therapist  i visit a psychiatrist  and i take my medications  but it never really gets any better  the second i m alone i m straight back to square one and i just have no peace anymore  it s really hard to sleep these days  i only get a couple hours a night at most    i just do all these things cause i want to feel better but i never really can  it s always back into the same old business as usual habits  i guess for some of us it never really changes ,depression
t3_dlvbpt,TheBoberts,i feel like happiness is a facade most of the time ,i don t know if anyone else feels like this as well  but i do have times where i am genuinely happy  with certain people  and doing certain things  and then at some point the thought pops into my mind that this is just the bridge until i am sad again   it s like everytime i feel happy and loved  it is just a fabrication to distract me from the fact that i ll soon feel at rock bottom again  almost like a tease of what life could feel like everyday if i didn t fuck it up all the time ,depression
t3_dlvazj,kalimoo,i feel so worthless right now,like what am i even doing here  what if i m just ruining everyone s life  i really didn t mean to hurt anyone  i promise  i don t want to make people feel bad or hate me  i don t even know if i m fun to be around  sometimes i m happy and fun and sometimes i m just sad and anxious  i don t want people to be scared to spend time with me because they don t know which part they re going to get  i really don t mean to be sad  i just want the people i love to be happy  but what if i m the one causing them not to be  i m trying to do better  i m taking medication that makes me more positive than normal  and i finally have a therapist i like but she s expensive and i can only afford to see her once a month  what if people who like me find out about my mental illness and leave me  i m so scared to open up about myself  i don t want any more people to leave  i don t want to be sad and i don t want to burden anyone anymore  i just wish i could be someone people want to be around  i don t want to make people not want to love me  i m so sorry to everyone i keep hurting  i just wish my brain wasn t so broken that i hurt everyone all the time  i m so sorry,depression

t3_dluj6r,Mr_Zippo,an anonymous scumf ck confession,   i don t know why i m writing this  i don t necessarily want attention  or deserve it  but nonetheless something in my mind deems it necessary to do  i have been anxious or depressed for the last   years of my life  i do not have contentedness on a level in which i can live my life without constantly wanting more out of it  i believe in nothing  i want for nothing in particular and don t know how to express these emotions in a way that wouldn t come across as disgustingly shallow or in any other way for that matter  i am sick  i have mental illness and addictions that simultaneously improve and become the expense of my mental health  it s cyclical now   weed  pills  alcohol    self harm   acid  sobriety  anxiety  depression  weed  pills     i don t have the patience or optimism to live in denial or hope  i don t want to die  i don t want to end my life  but i also don t know how to escape from my own mind  i hurt myself everyday  others cannot hurt me because i do not surround myself with people who are capable of such a thing  to know that your life is being lived in  a manner that is detrimental to longevity and contentedness  and simultaneously failing to change habits is paradoxical  but here i am again  writing to strangers for some type of affirmation that i m worth something to somebody   the responses are always the same  but counter intuitively  they make one feel worse  because  if other express that you benefit their lives even in the smallest way  you re left contemplating why you cannot believe them  or more fittingly  believe yourself when you tell yourself the same things  life is so very complicated  isn t it  imagine what mental gymnastics one has to go through to morally justify their position in society  the more i learn about the world and its inhabitants  history  and potential futures  the more i m left dazed and unsure  simultaneously grasping for some type of truth and feeling too tired to continue doing so  if one were to try to formulate their thoughts in a completely honest way  i think that nobody would understand them  i think that language lacks the complexity of the human experience  but i guess that s self evident  given that the human mind created language in the first place   therapy is probably the worst thing that someone that thinks like me can go through  it subjects oneself to tremendous trauma  only to be left with coping mechanisms and ignorance strategies  you cannot heal mental trauma when said trauma is inherit to chemical composition  the best human society has done is develop anti psychotic or mental inebriating substances to dull or augment one s inherit nature  i obviously favor the latter over the former  i write this  significantly intoxicated  waning off something that i never imagined myself taking  and experiencing ups and downs that bring on both fits of euphoric laughter and such despair than i cannot antiquate the feeling to the description of words   i miss being a child  before my grandparents died  before my mother locked herself away from feeling  before i grew to hate myself  before i tried to kill myself  before i regretted it  before i became an addict  before i tricked myself out of it  before i used people for temporary enjoyment  before i fell in love  before i was heartbroken  before i learned what society expects of those in my position  before i stopped caring about said expectations  before i sought attention from others by letting my personal issues out to dry ,depression

t3_dlu5tl,TotallyJustABot,really bad night   ,i apologize in advance since i ve already had a bit to drink  but here we go   earlier today my girlfriend told me we needed to talk after i got off work  fearing the worst  i had constant panic attacks throughout the day    to make a long story short  it s not about us per say   we  are fine  it s moreso what happened before we started going out  my girlfriend had   unconsentual sex   weeks before we started dated  a little over a month and some change ago     today  she found out that she is pregnant with his child and thast what she wanted to talk about   i did my best to put on a brave and strong face  but i m honestly terrified and severely depressed   she has no plans to keep thekid and has already set an appointment for the procedure   now she s stressed that her insurance won t cover it  so i told her i d cover the cost of it because i honestly see a real future with her  i ve told her many times that if i could marry her tomorrow  i would  she is that greay and i couldn t be happier with her  the only reason i m acting like i am is because i ve had these experiences while i was going through emt school  i ve never told anyone this  but during my er shift  one of my patients was a gangrape victim come to find out later that she was in this very situation    without giving our much info  she attempted to end it all with a firearm  but failed  and now has to live with the deformities of it    as soon as my girlfriend told me this  all of my past experiences in the fire department and emt  that i ve tried to forget  hit me like a freight train and i just don t know how to handle it  i m attempting to drink myself to sleep  but as you can see it ain t working too well    i love this girl more than life itself  and all i want to do is help people  i just don t know how to help the one person i love the most and it s killing me,depression

t3_dlu20d,MyUsualName,wishing i could do more for others  and at the same time helping myself in a way,so  i barely make enough to meet my own needs   but i wish i had the means to help others struggling with depression  mental illness or whatever without the fear of like being put away   i wonder like if there were enough like minded people in a given area if perhaps money could be pooled to accomplish something like this    how it would help me  feeling like i mattered or made a difference would probably help quite a bit actually    any thoughts or practical ways to go about this  at least in my mind a lot of people do not get the help they need  a lot of people end up having no one to talk to about their issues  someone who really understands what they are going through and cares enough to try to help    like i would be supportive of like anyone could come in and have someone to talk to with no commitment to the cause  i feel like everyone struggles in their own way and could use someone to just talk to    is my idea crazy  i feel like these kind of resourcea should be available everywhere  instead hell  short of saying you are suicidal and contacting crisis just to see a shrink is months on a waiting list    just wish i could make a difference ,depression
t3_dlu1h5,ConsciousWelder,everyone wants to die , not a native speaker sorry for bad english  don t you guys ever feel like what you re going through and wanting die is normal  sometimes i feel stupid for asking for help and thinking that i probably need medication because  don t we all  feel like that  i don t know  am i wrong if i say everyone has attempted suicided or at least thought about it at one point in life  am i really sick for wanting to die  am i wrong if i go to bed wishing not to wake up next morning  when i was in  th grade  i m a senior at hg  i asked my friend if she had ever tried to kill herself  and she looked at me as if i had just spoke another language  she didn t understand why i was asking her that and said she had never and would never do it  i thought about it for a moment and i knew she lied to me  for me it was impossible and it still is  to think that suicidal thoughts don t affect everyone  i m pretty sure my friends don t think i have these kind of thoughts  i m the one who s always  happy  and making jokes and stuff  what if they think of this too  what if everyone wants to die but nobody dares to say it  and once you have attempted to and you end up in a hospital  that s when you have  depression   isn t that how it is  i m not diagnosed but i feel as if everyday that passes is closer to the day i m finally gonna do it  one day will come and it s no gonna be like the other days when i was too coward to do it  that day will happen  one part of me doesn t want it to come but the other is anxiously waiting for it  because it should have happened a long time ago ,depression

t3_dltx76,ATypicalScholar,my life is hinged on the success or failure of an application ,hi  i m your typical normie that s shut down every aspect of my life because i don t know if i ll see my next birthday   i ve battled depression and suicidal tendencies for years  about   years   i haven t had a friend since  th grade  i m now    in my second to last semester of college and will be graduating with   bachelors degrees  i lost most of my belongings because i was  dumped and kicked out a year ago and left homeless for a month  she was cheating on me while she was supposedly out with friends  it culminated in her saying she was done and i needed to move out  she expected me out in a hour  so i lost important belongings and even my cats because she called the police and almost had me arrested  she got to keep most of my things except my recording equipment  a chair  and my laptop  i m surviving  but i just feel completely empty  i don t interact with anyone  i don t think i utter a word to a single person in a given week  i talk to myself kinda since i pay rent by doing voice work for advertisers and such  but it doesn t pay very well  i get the flexibility i need out of that work which is nice    but i m generally always alone  i haven t spoken to my family in   years except my brother  but that s gone  my brother was the only contact i had  but he passed away over a year ago  i didn t even get to go to the funeral or know he died until his wife posted it on facebook    i don t have a desire to connect with anyone and i don t worry about dating since it s not worth the emotional pain or effort  i ve mitigated my social network to merely work contacts that i never see in person   my life is hinged on whether i get into graduate school or not  i ve only been passionate about one particular field of study within the discipline of sociology so it s limited the masters programs i have to choose from  if i don t get in    honestly i ll be left with nothing  i m barely making rent  i haven t had medical insurance in over   years  i barely make my car payment and i m just lost   i haven t planned for not getting into graduate school because if i don t i m pretty much done  where i live i could never get a job with my degrees  even if i could i wouldn t want to because i only get enjoyment from researching and conducting studies  everything else i don t have the capacity to do anymore   so my life is hinged on whether i get to continue my pursuit for education and ability to research into my discipline or i crash and burn  i m prepared for both and honestly expect to fail ,depression

t3_dltopf,AudioKritik_YT,kind of in a shitty place right now and needed to vent a little  kinda need help  not therapy  just someone to talk to,so    a lot of things have gone wrong in the past few months  i kind of don t know where to start with this  so i ll just start and see where it goes      so  a few months ago  i started at a program called job corps  i m currently taking office administration  and that s been going pretty well for me  but  recently  especially today  i ve been feeling like nothing has been going right for me  i feel like nobody ever wants to be around me  and that they all just want to push me away  the few friends i did make here  except one  have all been treating me like shit lately  wether it be making fun of me behind my back  to my face  or just ignoring me  the only time their ever nice to me is when i have something they want  which is generally fuckin money  which i don t have  we get paid less than     every   weeks  its honestly bullshit   the one person i m able to talk to about this stuff is back home now  because he completed the program  i used to be able to talk to my boyfriend about stuff like this  but he s always busy with his own life  i understand that though  except now  i m unable to talk to him altogether  about the only thing i had to talk to him  or my parents was my laptop  but about   weeks ago  i was pushed down the stairs by this jackass  and ended up landing on it  fucking up the screen and a bunch of shit inside it  the center i m at usually refunds students for stuff like that  but apparently  it s only for stuff under a certain price range  and mine was about      over the price range  the worst part about that  is the amount of music projects i lot  almost   years worth  it s not like it mattered anyway  i wasn t an good at it  can t get it fixed either because the center was built on top of a fucking mountain and we have to apply to get off  don t know how i m going to talk to my boyfriend or parents for a while i don t have a phone and repairing the damn thing would be a waste of time because it would just get fucked up anyway  and i don t have the money to fucking replace the damn thing either  having to type this shit on one of the center computers that are super restrictive for no fucking reason  just so i can get some of this shit off my chest  i m just rambling at this point  but i dont really care  i m usually able to deal with this type of stuff  but today was just     fucking shit  for starters  it was pay day today  and they cut my pay in half  of the     we normally get  i only got     so that pissed me off  then  my  roommates  complained about me and they all got switched out of the room  i have no idea what they said about me  because i don t even talk to them  but now i m having to see the center director tomorrow  and i don t know what for  i know i didn t break any rules  so i m not getting terminated  but i still think it s bullshit  honestly  the more i m writng this  the more angry i m getting over how much bullshit has gone on just today alone  i ve just been feeling worthless  and unwanted for a while now  and i honestly was pushed over my breaking point today  sorry for those of you that read this  i m just having a shitty fucking few weeks and need to vent a bit  sorry  i didn t mean for this to turn into such an angry post  i ll probably just leave  noone wants me here anyway ,depression

t3_dltm7j,RockyRum,ignored,one of the single most contributing factors to my depression has been that no one listens   no one ever fucking asks anout me or listens    i m not just talking about my crazed emotional rants about my inner turmoil  no one will give me the time of day for basic conversation   not when i was     not when i was      not now when i m almost      my siblings  my parents  my wife  my friends  my coworkers   i dont blame any of them   what do they owe me   nothing   but i hate myself   i m always talked over  brushed past  or flat out ignored  i feel like a useless piece of shit  all i say are generic things or stupid jokes i read online  i smile as much as i can hoping to give a welcoming aura   i pay a therapist to listen   it s so foreign that it s hard to communicate anything i feel and i have such a hard time remembering conversations   i m honestly just venting here because i feel like i m going to implode   i want to disappear or run away like some kid but i m a grown man  the fear and anxiety is so intense i have found myself muttering under my breath lately without realizing i m doing it   i feel so lost but i feel melodramatic for saying that and guilty for even wanting more in life ,depression
t3_dltm2n,traush,my mom doesn t believe i m depressed gg,my mom sent me to therapy bc my thyroid noticed a  change  so basically she was forced  my mom went with me to the first two sessions  after that she doesn t even bother asking where i am  i got diagnosed with moderate severe depression  situational   i pulled back on telling my mom bc i was embarrassed  and today as is her usual routine of screaming at me i told her my therapist wants me to take antidepressants and she told me i don t need them  and to not dare and tell her yes   i m    and feel lost and have no one to talk to bc i ve isolated myself and my siblings don t talk to me,depression
t3_dltlrr,Scadeau101,it s so damn hard to do anything,i m lucky if i even shower once every two weeks  everything is so fucking difficult  i work    hours at a depressing office job  also in college with this shit weighing me down is nearly impossible  i have to fight myself just to do normal things like eat or drink even because i m so depressed i ve forgotten to do that so i m dehydrated and lacking nutrition apparently but i don t even feel hungry anymore   i can t focus on studying at all  i just seem to forget everything so quickly cause my memory is shit  i ve been getting       s on exams  i feel horrible and stupid seeing this which makes me even more depressed  i don t know how much longer i can take anymore ,depression
t3_dltl4z,the_biggestloser,mean or i should get over it ,i ve always felt that nobody likes me and people just walk all over me  i ve never really had any friend  i used to think i had a few good friend but time after time it seems that they just really dislike me and its hard for me to be around them  i remember in hs all i wanted to do for my   th birthday was to go see a funny dumb will ferrell movie but nobody wanted to  however  the next day i was told by them that they all went to see the movie without me on my birthday when i was at home all alone   that was sort of the ticking point for me since stuff like that always happened  but somehow i was pinned that bad guy for being angry and one of the girls who i did nothing to made it her mission to be so mean to me and make sure none of my friends would ever talk to me again   i remember her yelling at me and this girl in one of our classes cause we had to work in a group with her and she made me so uncomfortable i was going to have anxiety attack in class  all i did was not speak and yet that was enough for her to be a jerk for no reason    fast forward to college somehow we were talking again since i m kind of a push over and a forgiving person  but she continues to be cruel and mean to me for no reason i m still left out and i try so hard and me nice but yet again i feel like crap  should i just not speak to her any more  i dont really have any friends so i m not in the place to be losing them but she just really makes me sad and i can t deal with it anymore ,depression

t3_dltimc,xela_namesiw,healing is so fucking hard ,  recently  i ve tried to chronicle all of my trauma in order to understand why my depression and destructive coping mechanisms developed  it s awful  it feels like nothing has been right in my life since around age    only now  at     following my mother s death  do i feel like i ve gotten to rest a bit      i don t know how the fuck i m still alive  and i don t know how to process all of this on my own  especially when there are triggers everywhere  i wish i could afford therapy  because this is all too much        how am i supposed to be a self sufficient adult when my entire life has been spent suffering and trying to process never ending trauma  this is bullshit  i just want my life to be normal ,depression
t3_dlti9j,RevengeAbe,nobody special ,i don t know why i m typing this but i don t know what else to do  i ve felt worthless for over a while now i think it started when i was about nine  i could go into details but i don t think it s important  to get to the point i want to just not exist  i know somethings wrong with me  i don t know if i m just overly sensitive  depressed  bipolar or what but i m rarely happy and i m always down and have this thing about me where everyone leaves my life one way or another  i came to the conclusion that i m toxic or boring or something s seriously wrong with me because i have nobody and have nothing to live for which i guess is selfish  i ve tried getting help but whenever i used to reach out for help i d get the worst responses  the first time i asked for help was in middle school when i asked my mother if she could help me and that i was feeling really sad and stressed and she said that everything gets better and i just had to get through that time   th grade was a lot for me because a lot of events happened that just impacted my entire life and mindset and views on the world  i started to cut myself because i didn t know what else to do and then i went to school with cuts on my forearm and someone saw it and told me i was an attention whore  he said  you re such an attention whore if you really wanted to kill your self try vertical that should do it   so i nodded my head and said thanks  i went home and slit my wrist with a   inch incision  going down  my arm and i remember being on the floor home alone screaming because it hurt so fucking bad  i was getting mad because i wasn t dying it just fucking hurt and i wanted it to stop  so i got the knife and stabbed my arm and that s all i remember  i woke up in the hospital    all i could think was i m such a failure at life that i cant even kill myself right  then i came tie the realization that someone must ve taken me to the hospital  later i found out it was my mother who found me and took me to the hospital  i immediately started crying when my mom came into my room i was apologizing and she just didn t say anything  i felt so shitty because i was selfish    it was wrong of me but i didn t care at the time  after my mom saw me the doctors came back in with policemen and i saw my arms and they were handcuffed to the bed  they then took me to loma linda where i was put on a      and stripped my mother of all her rights for   days  they made me strip    and i don t want to go into detail because i m still not over it  it was demeaning and i ve never felt so numb  gone  it changed me forever  i was emasculated no longer did i feel like a man or boy just nothing  i felt embarrassed then nothing just like that  then was i really sure i wanted to die  i hated that place and still do  the people there were rude and mean and made me feel crappy  i remember lying so i could get out of that place because i wanted to leave so bad  when i finally was let go my mom took me home and when we got home she didn t speak to me  not one word  afterwards my mother the next morning came to me before i left for school  looked me in the eye and said  if i see that shit again on your arm i ll do it myself but make sure you don t live this time   at that moment i do feel like i lost everyone in my life that was it for me  i didn t try again because i was scared of failing and doing all that again  as time went on i still tried getting help  i thought i was getting better freshman year in high school  i was on the football team made some new friends and was doing good in school with straight a s  it s like whenever i think i m happy or okay something bad always happens  it s like i can t ever be happy  i remember asking my mom for help and she would just tell me that things would get better like she was in denial or she d say it s puberty and hormones which got me mad at the time so i said okay and went to my room  i asked again sophomore year for help and she said no  that it d be on my record and mess up my future  as time passed and the older i got  the worst my life got  junior year after actually begging on my knees for help my mom called me pathetic and said that she d get me a counselor  i saw progress  she taught me about impossible people and how to deal with my depression and ptsd and social anxiety etc  i noticed my mom struggling with payments and her job and providing for the family and i have   younger siblings  i knew it was the counselor that was taking the money  so i went into the office on my next appointment and said i m fine  that i was cured and lied my ass off  i said the nightmares stopped  i was happy and content and wouldn t waste time on negativity or the past etc  she then asked me if i was sure and i smiled and said yes i m positive  she discharged me and never saw me again  i regretted doing that because i was slowly going back into my life and when i tried to read those stupid papers that would  help me  or write my thoughts down or preform any of the techniques i was taught they just didn t work  it s like it was all false  i sucked it up though because i had too  i was the only other somewhat grown up in the house  my dad wasn t in the picture and i did it for my siblings  i remember fighting a lot  i got suspended twice and would lose a lot of friends or whatever they were because i pushed them away  i could tell i annoyed them with my issues and problems and never wanted to speak on it  i remember them always telling me i was sad and always in a bad mood and never happy  i made it through the year  but then hit my senior year which i thought would be better  my mother is phenomenal and amazing but she isn t good with me when it comes to emotion  she doesn t get my mentality i couldn t ever talk to her about my issues because she d call me a bitch or pathetic or useless and that only i can change the way i feel although i didn t know how to go about it  i hate waking up every morning just wanting to die and stop existing  i told my mother to just put me on medication  anti depressants but she refused  i even told her i d pay for it but she said no that when i turn    then i can whatever i want and denied me help again  she claimed it was hormones and that i m just going through a phase and i remember being mad because i ve felt this way since  th grade just it got worse  this is my senior year    i don t know what it is but any little thing can kill me completely  i just stop functioning and go into this dark place and don t want to move or do anything  oh yeah i forgot to mention i lost my motivation for everything and this year i quit varsity football and ditched school multiple times which i know is wrong but i couldn t be at that school with those people  fake people who talk shit about everyone and teachers acting like they care and people you ll never see again and the heart aches all of it  i can t do it  i don t know why i do some of the things i do but i guess i just stopped caring so recently i changed a lot  i told my mother i wanted to die and she called me selfish and i agreed with her saying that i probably was but i no longer cared  i gave up on myself a while ago i m just to scared to go through with it because knowing me i ll probably fail  the sad thing is that s the only reason i haven t tried again  after i told my mother that i wanted to kill myself she told me i was a waste of life and it fed something  it was like everything bad happening in my life all the insults and failures and misery just fed me like it was fuel for a fire  my grandmother on my dads side was a jehovahs witness  and my dad was christian my mother being catholic baptizing me as a catholic  i always did believe in god but recently stopped believing  i refuse to believe there s a god so irresponsible to make a shitty human race where the vast majority of the population is this bad  i don t want to bring religion into this i just know that this was one of the other drastic changes that have occurred  well i think i ll leave it here  i skipped a lot of things but this could be a summary of some parts of my life  i might write more just depends i guess if you read all of this thank you i hope you re doing better than i am ,depression

t3_dltgws,km454,how do you know when it s time to find a new therapist ,i ve struggled with my mental health for most of my life  and i have been to see tons of therapists and psychiatrists  unsuccessfully  in the last ten years  about three years ago  i suffered a serious breakdown and managed to find my current therapist  she and i have connected  and since i began seeing her i have made enormous strides  she connected me to my psychiatrist  and for the first time in years i felt like i might be able to someday handle this whole  living with depression  thing   two months ago  my therapist was diagnosed with a serious illness  i went from meeting with her every week  and emailing calling her between appointments to connect if necessary  to meeting with her once every two weeks with a high chance of last minute cancellations and minimal contact opportunities between appointments    i feel like i m taking a nosedive at the moment  i lack all motivation  i feel constantly irritable and disconnected  and i m starting to self isolate and self sabotage again  i feel like i m approaching my lowest point in years at the moment  the practice i see both her and my psychiatrist through has offered to transition me to someone else s caseload  but i am terrified  what if i can t connect with another person  what if i lose the three years of progress i have made in the time it takes me to adjust to the new person  it took over a year for me to feel comfortable with the person i am currently seeing  what if i can t handle the transition   has anyone else dealt with anything similar  i don t know how i can make the right decision here  on one hand  i leave the person i trust and risk losing the progress i ve made  on the other hand  i can stay with her and hope the inconsistency doesn t lead to a downward spiral   honestly  i d typically go to my therapist with this sort of decision for guidance and support through it  but i just don t know how or when to bring it up to her  i feel so alone and scared in making this decision at the moment ,depression

t3_dlsqec,fobnmdqm,i feel trapped in a deadlock,i started getting depressed when i was    and i m    now  for the last three years i am avoiding feeling depressed by basically not doing anything that will give me any stress  if i m not stressful i feel like i can suppress the deppressive feelings that i have  i get on day by day feeling not really terrible anymore most of the time  but nothing is ever really changing and overall my life still feels empty and meaningless  so what is the point really  in order for me to give my life any meaning at all i need to start doing things that will give me stress  which will inevitably slip me right back into depression  i feel like i am just kinda stuck in a life of doing nothing just to not feel absolutely miserable about myself on a daily basis  i m just waiting for something someone to come along in my life that i can really care about  and can give me the motivation to do something with my life  but with the life i m living right now nothing is ever really changing so i m starting to realize that this will probably not just randomly happen ,depression

t3_dlsmnb,Anonymousonreddity,so tomorrow is my birthday    ,hello everyone   tomorrow s is my birthday  but i m not happy about it   happiness is an aberration in my life   in high school i thought of ending my life nearly everyday  but i didn t   now i am a graduate student and lately i have been extremely depressed by a number of things that have piled up over the past few months  for starters  i had   friends graduate and move on with their lives this past summer  i really miss seeing them every day  more will leave in the coming year and i wonder if they will remember me  i m not the funniest or interesting person they ve known  but i tried to spend time with them before they left  at the expense of spending time with my family  one of them recently came back and invited some of my friends for drinks   i opened up to this friend about my social awkwardness and the loss that  i felt over the summer   he seemed very supportive and shared similar experiences in his life and how he got over them   so i thought that when he came back he would ve invited me to hang out   instead  i never got an invitation and later i found out that he wanted to hang out with those that he had a deeper connection with  which we didn t have  even though we got lunch before i found this out  i still feel gloomy about not being invited after all that i invested   this past summer   people i knew died  one of my cousins  a middle school high school friend who likely died of drugs  and a welcoming grandmother like figure in my community   there s more  i had a crush on someone in my program  early this year she started inviting me to lunch and other events with her friends  which was a pleasant surprise because i almost always initiated those things  she had rejected me before  but now i thought perhaps she had a change of heart  i didn t focus on asking her whether this was the case because of my past experience and also because i was in a harrowing struggle that i won to remain in my graduate program  i cannot disclose anything about this for fear of retaliation  but someone was trying to get rid of me from my program  that person failed   it seemed that everything with my crush was going well  but after a friend s wedding in late april  she stopped initiating those invitations  even though i continued to invite her to lunch with friends   to make a long story short  i heard recently she s dating one of my good friends who left the program   when i found out about this  i felt devastated  really devastated  i was in a depressed state before this happened  but now it s unimaginably worse  she is a very kind person that grew on me over the years  i feel so stupid and evil for thinking that things were going in the right direction  i feel so disgusted at the thought that i bothered or made her feel uncomfortable  i feel bad that she has to deal with this in her new relationship   my crush told me that we need to take space from each other  when i apologized for placing her in this situation and for any times that i made her feel uncomfortable  she thanked me  that made me feel worried that there were times when i made her feel uncomfortable  so i texted her this question  but she said that my texts were making her feel uncomfortable  with that  i haven t contacted her   weeks and i haven t seen her in nearly a month  i don t have any intention of doing so anytime soon  but this doesn t lessen the worry that i caused her discomfort  it also hurts me socially because i cannot hang out with friends that know her  i m trying to avoid venues where she will show up  negative thoughts like  i want to be turned into roadkill  or  i should receive the death penalty  have come to my mind  i have absolutely no intention of ending my life  but it s been very difficult lately and almost every day i m sobbing  this is excruciating      how can i be happy tomorrow when everything ended up like this   it s like my life is a bad set of cards that i got and i feel like it s time to fold     sorry for the long post ,depression

t3_dlsm00,ranji_shabnam,i made subtle progress in overcoming my undiagnosed depression   when i stopped treating religion as a source of happiness ,my mom s friend wanted me to talk to a religious leader about why i was upset  i ranted to him about everything that bothered me since i was young  and even cried a little bit  his bluntness pissed me off  though he wasn t a bad guy  he said i struggle with making friends since i m negative all the time  unhappy people are too attached to this world instead of the afterlife  don t blame my parents  marriage for making me unhappy  and stop comparing myself to others since everyone has struggles  everything he said was a damn cliche  and i felt worse after speaking to him  my mom was slightly smirking at me the whole time i ranted to him   later she said the religious leader was  realistic and practical   and told me i was upset he told the complete truth   this stranger off instagram was gentler with me  she pointed out i have a million images on how friendship works  and my mom s expectations of seeking happiness through religion don t match up with mine  this girl said it s okay for me to get angry at god and i probably have undiagnosed depression  my current therapist  of one month  was also more sympathetic like the girl off instagram when i cried in front of him a few times  he said i should let go of all the  fucking rules  i imposed on myself due to society and my culture  my parents  marriage did impact me negatively  and focus on making myself happy   and also added that i should let go of my mother s and brother s expectations of me  he and his intern also said it would be easier for me to connect to god after i found my inner peace   the stranger and my therapist already helped me make subtle progress within   months  i spend less time being lethargic and moping around since i suck at connecting with people  my anger towards god decreased a bit  i e   i stopped verbally  denouncing him  but i still can t make myself pray regularly    and just last week i stopped crying on a regular basis and stopped lashing out at my mom and brother when they hurt my feelings  my negative thoughts behaviors for around a decade have improved slightly   just because a stranger and my therapist did not resort to cliches in trying to help me out  and said it s okay to not rely on god for happiness  here s to hoping i can find energy to take proper care of myself soon   and maybe even learn to love god xx,depression

t3_dlsj1s,dinrovahorror,something about me is   off,this is an incoherent rant about myself and my life what i think   most people aren t sentient  they re husks of human beings  basically npc s   they re practically robots going through the motions  they have no inner thoughts   very few people  maybe      of the population is truly sentient and living in the moment  the second i lay eyes on these people i know they re sentient like me  sometimes i just look at my hands and realize i m alive in the moment and in control of my body  i was on autopilot before   i lie constantly  often for no reason  i speak and find lies coming out my mouth naturally without realizing it   i am extremely awkward and hate being around other people  from the  rd to  th grade i was emotionally bullied by people boxing me out and never interacting or speaking to me i have been an observer for so long i got used to it  i don t interact with people i just watch them  nowadays if i m jsut standing in a line i feel so uncomfortable and awkward i make people around me feel very uneasy and they seem put off by me  maybe even scared    amp  x   b   when i went to highschool it was a chance to start myself over again  but i got so used to being an observer that everything i say is said so i can observe how the person that i m talking to responds to it  i like seeing how people respond whether it be me watching them from afar and understanding them  i like building social profiles on people  i lack a moral compass i have blackmailed  stolen and done other nonviolent but rude acts  junior year i was socially active and at the height of my highschool career  senior year however i felt like shit had no motivation ate lunch in a library and never said anything in class    amp  x   b   i am currently    in college with no friends  i play a lot of league of legends  browse  chan and read manga watch anime   i lost my virginity to a random girl  met off an app who found me attractive  she was really attractive she was about     and a redhead  i found escalating to sexual relations with her easy but i never spoke to her again even though she texted me saying she wanted to meet me again   i have an obsession with traps futa shemales trannys dickgrils etc whatever you wanna call it  i mainly enjoy rule   and porn of this tag   this is my  th week on wellbutrin  i should be seeing a therapist in maybe   weeks   i know all this is weird shit to say but i like it when other people assess me and build their own social profile on me  i m obsessed with knowing everything and really wanna know what goes through other people s heads,depression

t3_dlsirm,MemelordBryan,i feel bad for feeling bad,i have my issues  i ve lost family members  had to put my dog of    years down recently  i ve grown up in a very verbally and emotionally abusive household  deal with suicidal thoughts and clinical depression  horrid social anxiety  but it s not like i ve been raped or beaten or gone to war and now have ptsd  i ve never been in a poverty stricken neighborhood or been starving  never had cancer or lost a limb  never had a close friend commit suicide  granted they ve tried and i had to talk them down from it  but they re fine now   there s just so much way worse shit that people go through every day  and i just hate myself so much for being upset over the dumb shit i have to deal with  yes i know the  others have it worse  argument is really common with depressed people  and it s not a good one  because even someone who has been beaten or raped can say  well  at least i m not starving or poor   pain is subjective  hell i have a friend who i think goes through way worse shit than me  and he thinks that my life is worse  and i m just like are you fucking kidding me  that s bullshit  my life is easy compared to others   i dunno  it s just hard not to think that way  scrolling online and seeing all the stories of traumatic events happening to people  and i do feel bad for them  but then it also just makes me upset with myself for feeling the way i do  and even a lot of people who do have it really bad are very positive  and i sit here in bed  crying over the dumb crap in my life    i m just really stupid for being so depressed  i know i can t help it  but i still just feel so fucking stupid for it  like  i m a waste of space  better people than me are out there and i m wasting their air  i am a waste of air lol  but  yeah   ,depression
t3_dlsg5c,zrex05,not in immediate danger  but disturbed by the thought that suicide for me is way more probable than it is for most  ya feel ,i have just a few more months left to go at university and i honestly feel like this is all there is to it  i really don t fucking get it though  i grew up in a good house  i have a scholarship at university so i won t drown in debt  i m about to get my degree in physics  my gpa is good  i m running ultra marathons      what the hell do i have to complain about  is life too easy  do i need to pick up a load and maybe then things will get better  my classes right now are really easy and i barely get hours at my part time job so should i look for more work  i have grown to hate physics so it doesn t help that i don t give two shits about what i m studying at university and the fact that i m probably never going to use it  so sick of  legging it out  until i hit the next chapter of my life  where i might find myself repeating the process  so either i buckle down and find something else to study after  even though i m fed up with being a student  or i take some shitty job that will probably wreck me from doing some repetitive task sitting for eight hours straight  i ve tried this kind of job on an internship before and only lasted two months  slammed a keyboard off the desk    i don t even feel like a person anymore with things to look forward to  it s almost like i watch myself and provide mental commentary like  it s waking up  it s going to feed itself some food  it might exercise  it s going to take a shower       if this is what my life is supposed to be like where i just sludge through and do what i have to do to live  then it s probably best to save the resources for someone else who has it together   the thing is though     i know that there is something to life worth living for  i got the chance to go out with friends a few nights ago and had a blast  had sex recently and felt great  saw some good movies  staying in shape  but everything just feels so lacking  maybe i need more responsibility  everything i m doing is easy and i have a ridiculous amount of free time on a daily basis but i have no idea what to fill the time with  it s so funny that i find myself envious of others that i see working really hard on a project or grinding something out  so obviously  i tell myself that i should get committed to something but i just wind up beating myself over the head because i have no idea what that something should be  in the meantime  i feel like i m watching time go by and it s making me feel like i m ready to die  despite the fact i m    which pretty much makes me a child on the grand scheme of things  i ll take any comments or words of advice  even if they are harsh ,depression
t3_dlsfzx,memegod-number-420,just some advice and a nice story for anyone who needs it ,so a little story followed by some advice if anyone wants to listen and this is a happy story and i don t want anyone to feel bad about themselves or get jealous after hearing this  i just felt like i need to say that   anyway the story so i m    and a couple months ago i went to summer camp made friends rode horses every day and every night before bed our cabin played the song fireflies by owl city so a couple days go by and out counselors took as to a old building that they used to go to and we went on to the roof and the views was amazing the sun was setting and it overlooked s river and a lot of nice plain grassland all with the nice tint of orange then later unrelatedly fireworks went off and the song fireflies was playing so i was sitting there looking over the fireworks the sunset and the shiny water just not happy but more of at peace with everything   so now i m almost sure that i have chronic depression but when i m feeling real down more than i am in general i think back to how just perfect that experience was and i remember the view and listen to the song and i get happy for a bit    so the advice i would give is to try and find a place in the world we re you can either go or think back in and remember just how nice it was  you can go alone or with someone play your favorite song and stay for as long as you want and go alone or with someone just try to find somewhere you can go that makes you happy and go where your feeling real low and also when your feeling low think back to any positive memory s you have and try to re live them   hope this helped someone out there ,depression

t3_dlsemu,AngelIslington,birthday depression  i hate it so much, right it s my big milestone    in a few weeks  my family have asked me what i want  maybe not feel so trapped  maybe not feel so depressed  the worst thing is  my mum basically told me to keep the day after my birthday free  so i m not important on the actual day because of course it s an inconvient to them  i really don t want anything  because i m so used to not getting anything at least it s familer  i m the women people contact when they want something  but no one ever calls me out of the blue and when i try  i always get knocked back like i m some type of interloaper in their lives  so i no longer bother  just needed to talk about it,depression

t3_dlsbwx,nowheresound,the stuck feeling ,i ve been dealing with depression for about seventeen years now  and the hardest feeling for me is still feeling  stuck    i have a job i don t hate  but it is exhausting and unpredictable and doesn t pay the bills  i lost my old job that i super hated back in february  and with it my health insurance  so i had to stop taking my antidepressants  even then i couldn t afford therapy  so i definitely can t now  i don t have a degree and desperately want to go back to school  but have just enough in delinquent student loans that i feel i can never make that right get funding again  i failed out of college twice because of undiagnosed major depression    anxiety    ocd which was diagnosed but not treated   when i look back on my time in college it truly feels like a nightmare  one where all the walls are melting into time and space and i can t even trust my own mind or body    i hate my personality and have about four friends  two of whom live near me and one of whom is moving to the other side of the world in a few months  i hate everything about my looks and body  and sometimes feel violently sick after thinking about seeing myself in the mirror    i like art and writing but trying to work on anything massively triggers my feelings of worthlessness and pointlessness    i don t feel like there s anything i can do  beyond making things better  just to make things okay  the worst part is  i ve only gotten to the point of being suicidal once  like seven years ago  and i didn t do it bc i didn t want people to have nothing worth remembering me for  so like  i get to just be nothing forever  and if i did get to that point  then i get to be the asshole who ruined people s lives by killing herself  people are always like   oh  don t you want to live to see  thing  happen   and yeah  i do  that s the problem  i have to live through a hundred days feeling like this to see one day feeling like that  a hundred days that each feel like a thousand years to see one day that makes me feel   not even normal  but fleetingly happy    i don t want to go to bed because then i have to lay alone with my thoughts  but i don t want to stay awake  because it feels like my life has become nothing but tending to my anxiety and depression  you know how  when you talk to a counselor  they re always like  can you distract yourself    sure  i can  but that s all i do  i m just  fully  stuck  and at this point  i ve been stuck for so long  what s the point of getting unstuck ,depression
t3_dlsboq,Goldshawty,             my thoughts  amp  fears are killing me one day,i don t know what to do anymore  i lack the strength for everything  ever since i was born  i ve only got one kick after the other in my face  i don t even have a family to support me    on the contrary  my family is so morbid that they consciously try to lower my mood and psyche even further than it is already down anyway  i don t have any friends  because all my previous friends have hurt me all in a row  and i just don t have the strength anymore to try to build up a friendship with anyone   and the only person i have now is my friend  the only person who always stands by me and fills my heart  but i can t really enjoy this either because people are always trying to tear us apart since we ve been together  and i already have very strong loss fears anyway  i live in constant fear of losing him  and it doesn t matter how often he tells me that won t happen  my head can t switch off  every night i eat all the pain into myself and i feel like it is dissolving me from within  sometimes i can t sleep at all at night  amp  if only very late  because i m so busy bringing my thoughts  to rest   all my thoughts and fears have become so bad by now that every morning i m afraid of the next night  and if my boyfriend wasn t lying next to me every night  i would probably collapse completely  i ve been going to therapy for over a year now  but unfortunately that doesn t help much  because it doesn t always help to talk about topics that don t improve  as soon as i stop thinking about something  the next thing that happens   to me is what i am burdened with    why should it help to talk about something at this moment  if it doesn t change the situation anyway ,depression

t3_dlrt1x,blue_phoenix_17,just started   mg prozac one week ago  feeling better mentally but these hot flashes are killing me ,first i will say how fucking stupid i ve been for the last   years avoiding trying another antidepressant  i did weekly therapy and took generic celexa years ago when i was going through my pre divorce separation as a way to cope  celexa helped with the mental symptoms after about   weeks    i didn t feel  happy  necessarily    just leveled out  i stopped because i was getting random vertigo  dizzy spells  ocular migraines  and the feeling of electrical shocks in my head  i ve been scared to take a different antidepressant until about a couple weeks ago   i ve been back in a deep pit of depression for a little over a year again due to a miscarriage and a hard breakup last year  i got an esa  which only has kind of helped but i was still finding myself sleeping all the time  feeling disinterested in everything  and feeling stuck and hopeless  my doc put me on   mg of generic prozac about a week ago  within the first   days  i could feel my mental fog lifting a bit  my energy and mood is better  and some the bad shit from last year is bothering me a lot less  so i m hopeful prozac is going to help me   problem is these hot flashes are killing me  i guess i ll save on my heating bills this winter but the random night sweats and hot flashes during the day are affecting me  i want to keep taking prozac to see if it improves my life  but i need something to deal with the side effects  i see my doctor again next week for a   week checkup for my new meds  but i m wondering if there is something i can take in the meantime to stop the hot flashes  if this is what menopause is like  i ll move to alaska when i m     oy veh ,depression
t3_dlrovm,CallumJK98,depression story,hi everyone  i don t know who s going to see this but i wanted to share a little on my life story   i grew up loving life was very sporty and very popular in school  i could get any girl i wanted etc  but this was early  all before     at that age my mum forced me to move out of catchment to a school with far better grades leaving all my great relationships behind  it s the only mistake she s ever made my mums amazing     it was so tough at that age to transition into a completely new school life and i was constantly anxious and despite always being popular at previous schools i never spoke to a girl for two years at that school  this kind of isolation and change i believe led my mental health down the wrong path   i ve smoked a ton of weed since i was    and and have had depressive thoughts since around when i moved school but i brushed them aside as they weren t so tragic   however now at    i have had serious suicidal thoughts daily for the past couple of years and one day after resisting drugs my whole life i was crying myself to bed one time and said to myself this really is enough i ve battled this shit for   years  i don t deserve it and it s gradually got tragically worse  so i finally tried mdma and of course it was the greatest experience ever    i ve since then done mdma about    times in   months which i know is ridiculously stupid and has fucked my brain chemistry  however i don t crave it so i ve got over that stupid binge now  i ve recently been binging on xanax too  the crazy thing is i haven t had any serious comedowns from these drugs ever  just tiredness and a lack of appetite   even with doing shifts on   hour sleep etc  i ve also felt brighter these last two months since i started doing hard drugs  that will most probably change i know   i have serious thoughts of suicide everyday and the voice in my head just pounds me with the things that it knows upset me most  over the years i ve become so subdued with my parents and our relationship has never been the same  maybe because i m just living one big lie  it s like i live two completely different lives   in honesty most of my depressive and suicidal feelings have stemmed from the fact of being so lonely everyday  feeling worthless and like no one gives a shit about me which is so hard as i used to be popular and someone people looked up to   the fact i could get any girl at one point and now i m a    year old loser who s only had one sexual partner in the last   years and having no one show any kind of interest at all is totally demoralising now  most people grow and blossom out as they grow older  i ve became the opposite    i have never shared such a thing and thank anyone who s took time to read this  i ve gone from loving life to wondering why i m living it and suffering awful pain almost everyday   is there anyone feeling a similar kind of way and what changes can i make in my life to see an improvement and maybe put a true smile back on my face one day ,depression

t3_dlr5dq,fizzyfart,there is a beast that lives inside my brain  its name is depression ,depression isn t just sad  it isn t listening to hard rock  or wearing dark clothes and makeup  although these are the stereotypical notions     depression asks to be hidden from the world so it can thrive inside you     my life is good  i don t need to get help    if i tell my family they will start to worry about me    if i tell my colleagues they will look down on me    feeling sad makes me special  it s my little sad secret   that last one is extra tricky with a self loathing undertone     depression wants something bad to happen  to yourself or others  so your tears can be justified    because panic attacks while driving home from work make you want to drive off the edge of a cliff  then the pain will stop   but maybe i shouldn t die just yet      depression is procrastinating    staying up all night watching youtube videos to fill your mind with brain garbage  which is always a better alternative to your natural train of thought     depression is a bully     you re weak  you re gaining weight  you re eating your feelings  you can t even stick to an easy workout routine for more than a week  you re stuck here now forever    side note  how can a depressed person gather enough will power to exercise when all their energy is devoted to keeping themselves afloat    i like to think that i have a happy version of myself fighting to get out  after all  it s been over    years  and i haven t done any serious self harm  and i do have moments of bliss and joy  but depression has grown strong  it knows me better than i know myself  and it knows that no matter how many self help books i read  and no matter what prescription i go on and off  it ll find the perfect opportunity to take me down again and again    maybe this is the way it s going to be forever  i ve gone to therapy  for as long as my insurance covered  a whole   sessions per year   i ve been on prescriptions  i ve made a virtually stress free environment for myself  i have many tools i can use to bring me off the edge of psychotic breakdown  so maybe i can live with that  maybe identifying depression as a beast will help separate myself from it    although i feel like my  self  is slipping away rapidly  the dizziness  the tiredness  it all feels like my natural homeostasis             f  has great job  a couple of friends  a loving fiance  two cute puppies  and chronic depression est      ,depression

t3_dlqy4o,zackryjay,i need some answers from people that can relate ,my bi polar disorder has flared up to what i would consider an extreme degree this year  i have been hospitalized   times this year and almost a fourth time following a recent incident    i had a child this year and he is the most amazing little boy  he has unlocked a side of me i never knew was there  his mother is a wonderful person too and i have caused her a lot of pain as well  i m ashamed to even recall some moments i ve had with her  they are just inexcusable and sometimes i wonder if demons  or something equivalent to them  are real and if i have been a host to one   this last incident was after my third hospitalization  i had come home to live with my parents which is where my son s mother also lives  tough situation  but we were doing so well  we had been communicating and i finally felt like i might have an intact family again  we went on a goodwill date  we kissed  i told her i loved her whenever i felt it was proper  but she wouldn t say it back  i do not blame her for this  she probably never will love me again  that is my problem to deal with    so  one day im at home with my two sisters and something goes off in my head  i start feeling useless and like a burden to everyone  my family is afraid of me because of the things they have seen me do  i have cut my arm wide open in a frenzy a few months back  i attempted to kill myself multiple times this year  all of the incidents following an intense debate with myself about my place in this world and if everyone would be better off if i was gone  i start having this internal debate and my mind finally got to a place where i said   okay  i have the guts now  do it before you lose your nerve and you re just a blithering whiny shell again   so  i go to the medicine cabinet and pull out a bottle trazadone and a bottle of muscle relaxers and start taking them  they are huge pills  about   seconds into this  i indeed lose my nerve again and start having a violent panic attack  i scream for my sisters  who are in their rooms unsuspecting and then this battle begins     i yell their names  i ll say lucy and kacey for their names in this story   lucy  kacey  please   i need an ambulance  i m dying   my heart is has fast as a mouse s footsteps and i m losing feeling in my extremities  i hear their footsteps and i hear a door slam   kacey  lucy  i m in here  i m here  please   my body is in full survivor mode  the back of my neck goes numb and my heart feels like a black hole in my throat  i am covered with pins and needles   lucy    no response   please  god please   at this point i hear no one  not a sound  i notice my fingers wont bend anymore and my vision is collected at a single point   please help   i finally said to god and then i blacked out  i woke up  still in full panic mode not knowing how much time had passed and was expecting an ambulance at any second  surely they called someone  are they hiding  i hear a car door slam   i m in here   i yelled right before puking all over the place  my body is covered in cold sweat  my fingers still won t move and i see the sweat marks on the couch under me and i puke again  i hear someone come through the door   in here   i said faintly  a man walks through the door frame and i see its my father   what the fuck is going on    lucy and kacey are at the neighbors house freaking out  what are you sick   why are you telling   i told him i took an overdose right before puking again  chalky white pieces of pills in a clear liquid all over the floor like a glacier broken off in the ocean   i guess we have to call the hospital  son   i said to him please don t  i dont want to go back  he said  then you tell them you are sick and thats it and shut the fuck up if you dont want to go back to the hospital   i agreed and promptly passed out again  i woke up in my dad s bed  i had no memory of getting there   people were confused  my girlfriend just thought i had had too much to drink and was being dramatic  my brother thought so too  i heard them talking as i woke up   i walked into the living room and said   not cool  guys  to my sisters   i needed an ambulance  i thought i was dying   they apologized  i went back to bed   i slept most of the next day and when i woke up my son s mother was giving me sideways glances and i was feeling very upset  i felt like my family were so scared of me that they wouldn t even callhelp when i needed it  i was hurt and embarrassed  i confronted her about the looks and she says she wasnt doing anything and my family was getting ready to leave to go shopping  so i said   look everyone ive been feeling really bad lately and i feel like im getting on everyone s nerves  what is going on  she  pointing at my sons mom  is giving me bad looks all day and i went through tge scariest episode in my life yesterday  why is everyone acting this way     my mom said that everyone is afraid of me  she was trying to find a place for my sisters to live and so was my son and his mother  they all wanted away from me   i ll save you all a lot of trouble   i said and walked to my truck   i got in and i hear my mom say lucy is going to call the cops if i leave and tell them im going to hurt myself  i didn t care  i was taking all of my hurt and confusion and i was leaving  i had planned to hang myself  but i didnt tell anyone that    i soon realized after i left that i left everything at home  my phone  my wallet  i didn t have supplies to go through with this so i waited a few hours and drove back home  everyone was gone  the house was locked up  i try every door and realize at this point i never really planned on killing myself  why was i back here if i did  why would i need my phone or my wallet  just fucking do it already you whiny piece of shit   i hear a door open  its my dad  i say i have no gas or anything and i have no where to go  he says   you can t stay here   and extends a     bill  take what you need and don t come back  i did   i slept in my truck cab for two days and now i m at my grandfather s house and last i heard  i m still not welcome   i kbow that

t3_dlqesk,TheLightwell,where do i find the help i need ,i ve lived check to check barely scraping by for most of my adult life  i ve been living with family for years because my fianc  has degenerative disc disease cannot work     of jobs  has been unable to hold one for more than a couple months and trying to get a place on one income in the usa in this time is damn near impossible  at least in my state  wa   we ve been trying to get her on disability but it s like trying to pull the teeth of a rabid hyena while juggling swords that are on fire  government just don t wanna give it out   we have a two year old son  and this is important because at this point in my life he s the only thing that keeps me from sticking my gun in my mouth and saying goodbye to this shithole we ve created  i m extremely suicidal  but would never follow through because i couldn t take myself away from my son like that  it wouldn t be fair to him   but living in misery is tough  i try to fake it  forcing smiles and cracking jokes to keep others unaware of the turmoil i feel in my mind  heart and soul  the governments of the world are all corrupt  there is no place left where people can live comfortably without working the vast majority of their lives away in jobs that are either meaningless  menial or unsatisfying  millionaires hire lawyers so they can find loopholes in our laws to allow them to evade their fair share of taxes  the    class has all but fucked the rest of us out of lives worth living  i have a decent job  apprenticing to become a residential electrician  and i know eventually money will come but it will still only be enough to support my family   i don t want to live like this  in a place of injustice  homelessness and hate  these problems have to have solutions  they need solutions  and i feel like given the time and funding we could solve them but with the way today s current structure is made it feels like insurmountable odds are against solving these problems and instead just want to place blame on whichever political party opposes your view   i need help  my mind is on overdrive      and i used to smoke weed to help alleviate some of my constant sadness and anxiety but now it seems i ve developed an allergy to it and it just makes these things worse along with trouble breathing  a rash and insane headaches  my life is not all that bad  but life in general seems worthless lately  like what is the point  idk what i need  but i think it starts with talking and expressing my feelings so that s what i m trying to do   i don t have insurance right now and even when i get it through my job i don t know if it would cover a psychologist and i couldn t afford one on my own  if anyone has some kind of advice please share it  i m sick of living  i m sick of how toxic society has become  people don t wave or smile at each other anymore  they don t hold doors  they don t talk like they used to  it all seems so fake and like it s this facade we ve created to simply keep confrontation and negative feelings away  i need something real  please ,depression

t3_dlqa9h,evanrjustdieplease,it seems that the theme of life is toughing through the dread  and trying to be thankful for the small moments that you feel like there s a purpose to it all ,this is my view  as a pessimist who longs to be an optimist  that life in a whole is mostly pain and that s why the good moments that seem so rare and far apart are so dear to us  if life was forever happiness and pleasantries  there would be nothing to be thankful for  nothing to strive for  nothing to give hope any meaning   honestly if life was forever happiness  then there would truly be no purpose ,depression

t3_dlq9fg,dubjanka,just another sad soul seeking serenity ,i dont know how to start this  so i ll just try to do my best   growing up i always felt alone  but i just recently realized how alone i was   i was always my mothers least favorite and i knew this  the most evident case was when my little brother broke our baby grand piano and my mom beat the shit out of me for it  then my little brother  feeling bad  admitted that it was him  and my mother bought him a brand new gameboy  for being honest   and he never got hit over that incident   it was a cycle of stuff like this  in the summer i wasnt allowed out until i finished  mommy school    mommy school  was upwards of   hours of summer classes issued by my mother and we had to finish whatever work she decided was necessary for us before we could go outside  when my brother got a question wrong my mom would comfort him and try to teach him how to do the thing better  i distinctly remember spelling a word wrong and getting hit with a flying dictionary before i could even apologize for being such a fucking moron    the cycle of violence continued thru my adolescence and stopped when i hit puberty around    years old  this cycle effected my entire life  i couldnt socialize because of her  example    i pushed one of my neighbors down the driveway on her razor scooter because she asked me to so she could go  as fast as me   and she fell  well my mom used to sit in our garage with the door open chain smoking cigarettes just watching me play  as soon as she saw the girl hit the floor i heard an all too familiar screech  dubjankaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa get your ass over here now   that was the worst beating i can ever remember  she was screaming in my face  her entire face was red as a cherry  spit was flying   at the time i couldnt have been older than     because i remember being about mid thigh height  and she kept screaming do you like being pushed while she threw me into the wall over and over and over while hitting me with a wooden pasta spoon anywhere she could  i was smart enough to know to protect my face but there was nothing i could do to stop my entire body from being thrown around  when she finally calmed down i limped down the street and brought  the girl  back to my mom to explain what had happened  i thought that things were getting better until the girl left and my mom locked the garage door before coming in the house  i knew shit was going to go down  she didnt appologize  she screamed in my face how dare you embarrass me like that    ding ding round two    once that subsided i was allowed to go to my room where i proceeded to cry my fucking eyes out  until i heard a knock on my door and   ding ding round three   i had the distinct pleasure of hearing for the first time in my life  you wanna cry  ill give you a fucking reason to cry   so that round stopped after a few minutes because thank god my father came home    my mother made me feel so estranged from my father that i felt bad asking him for a ride to a friends house  or even just to talk  she always said  dont you dare bother your father hes very busy  it was just her way of keeping me from telling on her for hitting me    i have an older brother  and he was my hero   oh ill explain why in a few paragraphs  because he was the only human in the entire world to interfere with a beating  he was sleeping  and he heard the commotion downstairs  i dont think ive ever heard anyone come down the stairs that quickly in my entire fucking life  and right as i looked down to avoid getting hit in the face the hit never came  i looked up and there he was  in all his glory  my big bro bro  the absolute gem grabbed the pasta spoon mid swing and he screamed at her something along the lines of you might have done that shit to me but ill be damned if you ever do it to him  and we hopped in his jeep wrangler  doorless  and he sped away with me in a baby seat  unfortunately on the way to his friends house we made a sharp left turn and i dont think my brother buckled me in properly  or the seatbelts were faulty like he said  and my entire baby seat came out of the car and i hit the ground and rolled  it wasnt so bad it was only like    mph give or take  and from my toes to my knees the skin was just gone  i had some minor scratches on my arms and face but the majority of the damage was to the legs  so my brother rushed me home and my mom just put me in the bath tub and scrubbed the gravel out  and they put me to bed  and within   minutes my brother came home with the most toys that i have ever seen in my entire life  i got my very own ninja turtles and a buzz lightyear and some batman figurines  i was surprisingly happy about the whole incident   fast forward to my late teens i would always talk about the aforementioned story any time i ever saw my big brother because it was one of the happiest moments of my life  even if i got a beating that day  and fell out of a car  i was just happy that someone cared about me  but my brother had to go ahead and ruin that by saying  are you that fucking stupid that you think i would actually buy you toys  and that i would buy them that fast  those are just the toys mom had around the house to shut you the fuck up when you wouldnt stop crying   well ok then buddy memory ruined   i was never allowed to have a childhood  my entire childhood i was forced to swim for multiple teams      teams per season   yes thats per season and no im not lying    because of this i never got to make any friends because anyone i met during school i could never see after  so during this period of swimming at around age    a coach tried to rape me and i beat his ass in the locker room  it was mid winter and i ran out of the facility into the street and straight into oncoming traffic  thank god a soccer mom in her soccer mom mini van saw me  i had cuts on my chest  was visibly crying  and was soaking wet in a speedo  she took me into her car  asked what happened  covered me in a coat and immediately called the police  within   minutes and im not joking it was the best response time ive ever seen  rambo pulls up  this cop couldnt have been a more muscular guy if he was doing steroids every day since birth  absolutely brollick  he runs up to the car  takes one look at me and says  who did it  and i tell him its jim  jim did it  he runs inside and in   or so minutes he came back out with a new breifcase  and by breifcase i mean my swim coach  he cuffed his hands behind his back  cuffed his ankles and cuffed the ankles and hands together with   sets of cuffs  he walked out with jim crying like the little bitch he was that his circulation was being cut off and bla bla bla  he opens the police cruiser door and throws that little bitch against the door  within a few minutes my mom comes to the scene and sees whats going on and tells the officer to immediately let jim out of the car  my mom insisted that it had to be my fault and that jim would never do this if it wasnt my fault  to this day she tells me that she saw a car with a broken window and she thought i smashed jims window and jim beat me up because of that  nobody i know ever saw a broken window  not even the cop when i came back a year later to decide if i wanted to press charges  i didnt want to press charges  i had just hit puberty  so i wanted to get a sanctioned boxing match against jim so i could kill him and get away with it  the officer informed me that regrettably i could not do that  so i didnt press charges   my mother always used to tell me that if i was ever drinking and needed help to call her  so when i was about    i got drunk and called my mom to pick me up  right before she got there the police arrived as well  she walked thru them and came to get me and started screaming arrest this motherfucker and all this shit infront of my entire class  it was so embarassing  that was the night i told her i wanted to kill myself  she told me to go to bed and called a shrink that was retiring in   weeks  the shrink gave me every single sample he had of anti depressants  coupled with literally no therapy  we just used to play with his guns and then he would let me leave  so i just got     s of free anti depressants but thats not a good thing  i have rapid cycling manic depression  they make me go hyper manic    so eventually things die down but im still alone  because of how i acted as a person  i had no self awareness and no introspection at all  and because of how my mother was i was entirely unable to make a real friend  everyone that i was friends with invited me out so they could laugh behind my back and use me for my money  i started landscaping at    because i needed money  i was always known as the lazy child though  anywho  you know how they say if youre not in a group chat thats because the group chat is talking about you  well i ve never been in a group chat my entire life  ive also never been invited to a party  ive also never had a best friend  ive had a series of girlfriends that were just more and more like my mother  until i met my most recent girlfriend  we ll call her d  hi d sorry youre on the couch and im being weird on reddit  so up until d i never had a friend  being with this woman has shown me what an actual friend is like  what being comfortable is like  and its nice  well thats alie  my dads always been my best friend  he s really the only person who ever wanted to hang out with me  he would take me kayaking and golfing and to baseball games  its really dope  im    and we still chill on the regular  without him i would have undoubtedly killed myself     amp  x   b    amp  x   b   i feel like im rambling  im sorry guys  i dont really know how to properly express my deep sadness     amp  x   b   what i was trying to get at is that just because someones cis gendered  and white  and middle class  and decent looking doesnt mean their problems are invalid  my entire life my ability to feel sad has been socially invalidated because of those   qualities i have  thats unfair and i don t appreciate it  everyones problems are relative  everyone has a best and a worst moment and no one gets the right to tell you dont   eg  if your entire life is perfect and nothing bad ever happens to you until one day you step on a lego and it really really hurts  and you keep telling everyone how much it hurts and how its effecting you and no one listens  well i hear you  and i really am sorry that you had to go through that  you just experienced your worst moment and you re still here  what can i do to help you  do you wanna go for a walk  do you want to talk about it  wanna just watch tv and forget about it  count me in  the only problem is you cant count me in  because you dont talk to me and youve always made fun of me  but hey  despite everything  id still be here to talk to you if you wanted  you just choose not to talk to me    amp  x   b   tldr  i m an emotional mess who cant express himself and i m just now at    learning how to deal with life  it s never too late  if you refuse to accept failure as an option you will eventually succeed  i m    and   years ago i was homeless because my mom kicked me out because and i quote  if youre a fag i will never love you   well im not a whole fag  just half of one  bi  but in those   years since losing everything  i have found myself  and i never thought i would  i still dont have a job  but im in school  i only have two friends  but thats way more than i had before  ones my dad and the others my girlfriend     amp  x   b   idk im just sad and wana vent  i wish i could do it better  but eventually i ll get some closure or i ll just pop like a balloon filled with too much vapid bullshit    amp  x   b   if anyone wants to talk  i m down  maybe we could start a reddit group chat so we can all help  eachother and just have some good vibes and good times    amp  x   b   i love u reddit  you re like the best friend i always dreamed of  if reddit could give actual hugs it would be a perfect place  but i guess pobodys nerfect ,depression

t3_dloy7s,Shadow-nim,does medication really work  did it help you release some of the anguish distress and numbness melancholy ,people say that talking may help  but i don t think that therapy will be that effective with me  of course  i ll make an appointment with a psychiatrist with the sole purpose of getting medication  yet i don t see the possibility that opening up with anyone will be any beneficial to me ,depression
t3_dloxzg,HolyWaterLube,really think i don t deserve to vent here because i m just some edgy teenager ,so here it goes  you can all call me a quirky teenager for wanting to die  but i honestly need to dump my thoughts here   just because i feel like my friends will just brush it off like my problems aren t even worth talking about it  i ve learnt that from earlier experiences   i slept more than    hours today  i woke up many times realising that i need to be awake to get my tasks done  only to just give up and crawl back in bed   today  my mother and father played videos of the past on the tv  god  i despised every second of it  i was so happy  annoying  fucking fat and who clothed me in the most unflattering clothing ever  no wonder i got bullied  and let alone afterwards because i responded like a dead fish  it felt like a confirmation of why i already hated myself  it s like a theory  proven right  i really don t deserve to live  the earth is already over populated   they ll probably never notice   sorry  that s everything that i can get out of my brain right now  i swear it s more than that but my brain won t allow me to write more than i think to myself   have a good day you amazing people  thank you for taking your time to read my shitty story ,depression

t3_dloupi,CptJoestar,something has always felt  off   idk i just need somewhere to put these thoughts ,i ve always been afraid of opening up to people so i hope this helps  i remember when i was younger about elementary age i remember feeling that happiness was always harder for me then the other kids  later on in life at about highschool i always had some sort of numbness emotion wise and i realized that i had started to drift away from people in general  i never really questioned this until now  i m a freshman in college now and i think i ve hit a breaking point  i m immensely unsatisfied with the state my life is in but i would never think about it to hard or talk to people about it  all through high school to now i  just lied to everyone and kept smiling and cracking jokes  a couple of weeks ago i woke up in a horrible mood buried under the stress of school and the inadequacies of my life  i had always thought suicide was stupid and if you commit it that you were selfish  i thought i would never amount to doing such a thing  but for that entire day ending my life was all i could think about  i had a hard time thinking and breathing all day i might as well not have gone to class that day and when i got off of the train to head home i looked at the train tracks and i remember saying in my head  this could be it   i quickly snapped out of it and walked home  i haven t told anyone about these thoughts and i still have them occasionally and it all culminated to today where i found myself crying into school notes debating on whether to end it or not  i wish i wasn t born  i would kill myself but i would hate knowing the effect it would have on those who care about me  so tonight i m gonna tell my mom how i truly feel inside and seek help before this gets bad     it might a little in cohesive but i just need to get my thoughts out ,depression

t3_dlorw3,rocketcat05,i don t want to die  help ,a little back story  i m autistic  i was taken out of high school for issues i had with the environment and how it negatively affected me i didn t say a word to anyone anymore  i skipped frequently  ran away from home hoping someone would kill me or take me away  after i was taken out  it was nice at first because i could just do my schoolwork in peace and play videogames for the rest of day  everyday  all day  eventually  even though i was in an environment that better suited me  i was still depressed and hopeless about my future and still hated myself for being different from everyone else  i had no doubt that i was going to kill myself eventually one day in the near future with how things were  at that point  i d been locked in my room for around   years  and hadn t been outside in around   years  i was nothing less than miserable and ready to call it quits   but  i somehow kept myself distracted on videogames long enough that another   years had passed  i was still miserable  but i was alive  i was    at that point and knew i was hurdling towards adulthood  i knew i had zero skills of any kind  i knew i was socially inept in every regard  and i knew i still had no clue on what i wanted from life  so again  i was planning on killing myself before i turned    with a mindset of   this world isn t made for people like me   and   i d make it nowhere if i couldn t communicate   although  amidst all that frustration and confusion  after a meltdown where i broke some things  i just got an idea from nowhere   i had literally nothing to lose but my sanity  so i pursued it and started writing my idea  and i wrote  and wrote  and wrote  and wrote all the way through      without noticing  around late       i realized that writing actually made me feel good and it was something i was good at  i had found a purpose to live and a goal to chase  that was the thing i was missing my entire life and it was now right in front of me  i d been dead for so long  just cruising by along the river of life  and i d finally gotten a hint of what it felt like to be alive  i didn t want it to fizzle out   fast forward to now  and i ve written my first fantasy novel coming to    k words  i m working on a sequel to the first and a standalone on the side as of this moment  but then it came back to me that i was going to spend my life in this room  i don t want to spend my life in this room  i want to experience things my own way and not be restricted to these four walls for forever  then  i was back to wondering what was the point in writing  just so it could rot in this room alongside me  and not bring others as much joy and excitement as it s brought me in writing it  i want to live so badly  but at the same time  i don t if this is what my life will be   i asked my mother to let me see a doctor so i could get help and maybe get to a point where i can function enough to exist in the outside world  but it doesn t seem like she s on board  at first  she said i d see one in september  then it was pushed back to october  and now october s almost over and i m still sitting in the same spot i ve been in the last five years  i can t do anything on my own because i m powerless and have nothing  again  i m back to thinking i guess i m killing myself after all  and this time it feels like the end  like i m aiming a gun at my own head and waiting to pull the trigger  why should i keep jumping through hoops and trying to better myself  when i always end right back where i started  feeling the same as i ve always felt  i don t want to go without saying i fought my hardest  so after october passes  i m going to have myself put into a psych ward  but i m also afraid that will result in nothing  and then i ll really have to kill myself and it ll be over  i ll be dead and have never known what it meant to be alive   that s why i m also here  i don t want to die  but i m weak and tired after fighting the same cause the entirety of my life  what other options do i have besides dying ,depression

t3_dlnljk,zefylum,about me  lol,growing up i was good at ignoring issues  negative feeling and thoughts  yeah i would get upset sad every once in a while but i wouldn t let it get to me that much  i had a very stoic approach to things and i only cared about having a good time but as i got older everything seemed temporary and meaningless  even family friends that were once very close to me are now nothing but people i hang out waste time with   nothing interests me anymore and the only thing that is keeping me going is my mom  i don t want to disappoint her needless to say i don t want to be selfish and drop out of university   i know this is a very confusing post but i feel like i had some signs of depression early on in life but i never cared enough to look into it because i don t want to be a burden and add another thing to a list of things my mom has to worry about  as you can tell by now my father isn t a part of my life and i think it will stay that way for a long time   my parents finalized their divorce this january which has been an ongoing case since      and only recently did i start to notice how resentful i am towards him  and towards myself for not being able to support my mom   i d like to go to a therapist but i don t want to come across or sound like a privileged  whiny bitch   so i came to pour my thoughts out to the second best thing i could think of and that was reddit ,depression

t3_dlm89v,hmm-what-do-now,nothing works and everything is going wrong,i first noticed i was depressed my sophomore year of college  over the summer of my freshman year  my  friends  kicked me out of their suite and put someone else in it  i was hurt but was determined to not let that stop our friendship  i tried hard last year to stay in touch with them but they seemed to drift farther away  at that time my mental health definitely started to decline and i stopped putting in the effort  if they did not want to spend time with me i didn t want to spend time with them   they also hinted that since i became depressed i wasn t as fun to be around  and they have no desire in being there for me during this time  i ended up spending most days in bed unless i was doing something  i d still  study  go to the gym and call home  but besides that i just stayed in bed  i smoked almost everyday  not too cope or numb the pain but just to do something  i was bored  that being said it did help me with my plan  i tried to make every day so similar that it would feel like a blur  and it worked  time honestly seemed to fly by and the next thing i knew it was summer   side note summer  winter vacations  breaks are all the best  i am happiest when i am home  with friends that care  with work to distract me  during these times i m only sad at night when i m alone   fast forward to junior year everything got worse  the year started off well  i tried to rekindle my friendships at school and it did seem to get better  i also had a single room and had signed up to study abroad  solo  in amsterdam  i had peace in my room and i was excited to finally get away from my school next semester and discover amsterdam on my own  i then learned that i would be getting a new roommate  he was moved in because he sexually assaulted someone in his last suite and rather than kick him out they placed him with me  he was horrible  drunk and belligerent every night  made my room a mess  stole my clothes and finally caused so much of a scene that the school kicked him out  i was told he wouldn t be coming back so i decided to splurge  spent       on new fixings for my room  posters  sheets  etc to try to bring some life to the room  i was told last week that despite what i was told i would be getting a new roommate again  not only would this throw off my single room  which was the one thing giving me happiness at school but i also had now wasted a lot of money    at this point i decided i would try to graduate early  i had a few ap credits and just needed two extra classes  i am doing a winter class and was told i could do an internship over the summer for credit  today i was told that to do an internship even if i found it i would have to pay my school        to have it count as a class and that it might not even count since they prefer me to go for   semesters  i explained i was trying to leave this school as fast as possible and they said they d get back to me   in the meantime my relationships at school have all gone to shit  i have completely cut off ties with my friends  the purposefully exclude me now and i have heard them talk about how they wish i d stop visiting them on multiple occasions now   i ve been skipping meals and have already lost   lbs  already a skinny guy   and im not doing great in classes  the only thing i have to look forward too is my study abroad and winter and summer break  until then i feel like my situation is going to get worse and at this point everything feels like a waste  i m killing myself with extra work and stress and might not even gain anything from it  i think i can handle one more semester but if i can t graduate early i don t know what i m going to do   i m at a point where i feel like nothing i do matters and everyone is out to get me  i know this is a long rant so i hope it flows well but i ve never posted here and feel like i just had to get this all out in the open  i just want to be done with all of this so i can focus on myself and get back to work and out of this horrible school ,depression

t3_dlm47m,FauxStardust,the feeling is back,i feel so dead inside again  i haven t been this depressed since my last attempt  i ve been staying at home for weeks and if i go out i get blackout drunk and make some seriously fucked up choices   i don t really know what to do  i can t just do this again  i can t continue laying around wishing for someone to just be my friend so i don t have to live inside of my head where my thoughts nonstop eat away at me   every morning when i wake up i wish everything weren t real and dread the fact that i ll have to just exist for a whole day  the only people who talk to me at the moment are my parents  both of which are narcissistic and just being near them is a constant psychological battle   and because they re the only people who speak to me i try to share things i like and enjoy talking about but they just get annoyed or completely ignore me  and then i remember why nobody wants to talk to me  i m just a nuisance  a waste of space  a disaster  whatever you want to call it  but what i know for sure is that everyone around me wants me to vanish   just within a month my entire friend group turned on me  then my boyfriend did too and started hitting me   it made me realise how little people give a fuck about me let alone my wellbeing   i let the violence continue until i just called the cops one day  now it s been some time after and this is the most isolated i ve ever been   i keep thinking i can text a friend about what s going on and then i remember none of them want to speak anymore  i keep waking up and expecting my boyfriend to be in the house and he isn t here either  and then i remember why too   i keep picking my phone up every time it buzzes praying it s a text from someone  and it never is   i feel like i m watching the entire world happen from a telescope  seeing my used to be friends posting photos of all the parties and events and adventures they re going on  i m really glad they re happy but i miss being a part of that  how the fuck did i go from making friends every time i leave the house to having none and being kept inside due to crippling anxiety  how and why  i m so tired of life   this was pointless to post but i need to get this out and put it somewhere  i m losing my mind ,depression
t3_dllzs7,ahassan666,anyone else want to die because of school ,i m in college and i absolutely hate being here i barely talk to anyone and i m so slow and have failed a few courses  it s getting to the point where i don t even know if i should stay here  because my transcript is a big shitball  all my motivation goes away because of one stinkin class that i m doing horrible in  and i lose almost all my confidence  anyway i m curious if anyone feels remotely similar ,depression
t3_dllvy2,silenttigersteps,i fucking hate my life and looking forward to shoot myself one day ,i fucking hate everything on this world  from the beginning of my teenage years of    years  everything rotated around and turned into miserable shit that i have to suffer from every single day  now i m eightteen and shit hasn t changed from the tiniest bit  fuck all of the scums who say  everything will be better bro    just love yourself bro   the right people and so will come along just wait bro   these are the kind of people who don t know what it s like to be depressed and destroyed to the ground  the repetitiveness of every single day  month and year just tires me out to the point i just can t take it anymore  i feel the hate  my loneliness  my anger  more and more as time passes that i can t be assed with to get outside anymore  i hate school and don t want to go there anymore even if it s my last year before graduation but i still force myself to see one big crowd of canned piss at one place   i never used to had any true or loyal friends in my entire life reaching back to kindergarten times and that already sucked  i m not a great conversationist to woo people into my direction but i m not the weird nerd type either  no one visited my birthday parties  i never went out to play neither do activites with other kids  i was always the loner from the beginning of elementary to now who no one wanted to talk to  i for real cannot remember anything positive and memorable in my life other than slitting myself like a violin on new years eve at midnight and whimpering through the year how absolute shit my life is  love life is non existent  girls laugh their asses off telling i look like    or    when i m actually    as mentioned and my height         seems also too problematic for them since everyone of them is either tall as me or even more taller  had only one long distance but it didn t last much and she lied and dated multiple men behind my back to ultimatively dumping me  taking advice from people who say to wait for the right one will level you up to a age    virgin wizard if that s what you want  i find it unbelievable that the majority of people aren t redpilled and still live like in a disney dream world  fuck relationships these days because i don t care anymore  i see no reason to get into romance with these emotionally driven children anymore  this school year i developed an unnecessary crush on a girl in my class which makes it even more depressing for me  i doubt she even likes me back but who the fuck would like me anyway  i never had a crush have mutual feelings and all i received was rejection from getting all my rejection fearing shit together to confess to them  while the girls i have absolutely no interest to chase me down instead  i m fairly attractive from ratings of people  today was an extremely shit day and i felt so completely done  overwhelmed and couldn t concentrate at all  couldn t answer the questions the teachers asked me in class and did everything wrong  she probably thought what an idiot am i so why give me attention   highschool is complete bullshittery  no one liked me there when i switched my school and came over to them  survived half a year in there getting told into my face that no one likes me till at one point right before the end of the school year i got falsely accused out of nowhere as an school shooter from someone i don t know of  some guys had spread false rumors about me being a school shooter which caused half the population of the school refusing to come the next day  principal and teachers forced me to go apologize infront of the class for a believed lie about me  told them to fuck off and got suspended from the school  had to deal with cops  stuff went fine as i was innocent anyways  the dickheads got busted out instead  but for the cost of my reputation my entire city hates me now and spits on me wherever i walk  i m also not allowed to enter the area around their school anymore  no true friends  no support  nothing but only hate filled text messages i receive from random people time to time  someone came one night over to the entrance door to my apartment and destroyed it by throwing rocks and bashing on it  all the   people who told me they re here back in the days i used to talk to vanished from me and pretend i don t exist anymore  there you go  true friends we can call that  i was so over by that point i tried to commit suicide three times in a row on the following new year on midnight  failed all of them and instead had some retarded johaniters call me on phone to try to assign me to their sanatorium  by the way in my country showing any history of issues like these and you re guaranted to have no career lol  i m fine in school and my grades are okay and aren t affected by my issues   so i talked my way out of them and continued to live like always  i wish i could have had a gun on that moment   it would make the work so much easier just thinking about it  then i finally wouldn t be here anymore but only a flying spirit wandering this depressing world over the clouds   fast forwarding one year later to today and shit still isn t anything worth  on the other side stuff has calmed down and i get ignored and disliked by the entire population in my city  living a normal gray normie life though filled with loneliness  sadness  being alone and without any motivation  literally zero people in my life  i never talk  family is the typical eastern european toxic family that doesn t have depression in their dictionary  my parents mocks me why i still don t have a girlfriend at my age and mum tries to transform me into a complete beta by telling me to be mr  niceguy on a whole new level to girls  shoving toxic masculinity onto me is also okay for her  she doesn t want to understand today s females and thinks we re still here in the   s  i don t spend any time with my family and go on my own instead since i feel too mentally drained around them  i like to be alone and not bothered by them   i don t need hobbies as i m oversupplied on them already  i m a boxer  i workout  i code  i rap and sing  i m a gamer and use video games to temporarily numb my feelings  there s more but fuck that  i lost motivation to do anything for the past three months but slowly returned to it again to not feel like a complete loser  i still don t enjoy life  i never got to enjoy my teenage years  i never got to experience fun and have a adventurous life with other teenagers  i never got anything of that  hell i barely ever reached a peak of   people who i would talk to sometimes in school  though they pretended like i didn t exist outside of the classroom   the only social interaction i have in my life is e mail penpalling which i discovered back in      to make up for the emptiness in my soul  i fed off from them to keep me internally alive but not a while ago i don t feel like doing that anymore  the majority of them left and only a few besties of   year are holding on onto me  funny how internet people are better to make friends with   that s it  i m done with venting random shit on here because our reputation got ruined by cutting attention whores flexing their scars to everyone in the classroom and white girls who find it trendy to have a mental illness so there s no one to vent to  i never unbottled my feelings to anyone or showed any signs of sadness just to have unnecessary asshats off my back that i don t need   afterall  fuck all of this  i see no brightness in my future anymore  i m destined to be alone for the rest of my life and follow the same routine in my day while listening to an endless loop of the same  uicideboy  songs  i m made to be starved  i will get out of this body full of aching pain as soon as i get my possibility  see you all in the afterlife ,depression

t3_dllr75,sorrystheonlywordino,after so so many years of pain i can finally say i am no longer depressed,i don t really know where to begin  it wasn t even a week ago when i thought all was lost  i had no faith in anything but i finally found a reason to be faithful it literally hit me like a ton of bricks and everything changed i am just so happy simple as that and i just do not see things changing anytime soon for me i don t know how it happened but the fact that someone as lost as me can have an unexpected life altering experience and just feel so much better overall and just feel so great in less than    hours it happened believe it don t believe it in    hours my entire mindset shifted from fuck the world fuck my life kill me now to holy fuck life is the single greatest thing that has ever happened to me  you don t know me  you don t know just how fucking far gone i was and there is just one simple truth anything is possible how could it not be  the fact that someone as lost as this mother fucking piece of trash can flip a switch he didn t know existed than that means it can happen to you as well  i know it sounds cliche as fuck but the power of belief is so much stronger than we realize  i thought there was no hope i thought there was no way it could get better i was wrong and i so not give a fuck what kind of life you live  if you feel this way too you are wrong you are wrong you are fucking wrong and never god damn forget it i love all of you i love everyone never attempt to kill yourself i am living proof that it doesn t matter how bad it gets there is always hope               i know it won t be easy for you but it will get better tell yourself that everyday because it is true and i swear on my life if you can find a way to convince yourself of that it will be true the power of belief is so incredibly strong i can t even begin to stress this enough and it might even be the key to getting better you have to fucking believe it is the key ingredient to unlocking you re potential again i am living proof and honestly i am so grateful for getting depressed in the first place without it i would have never have understood that there is no limit to what we can accomplish if it wasn t for depression i would probably be just a regular guy but now i feel unstoppable           love you love you love you you are all loved never fucking forget                   ,depression

t3_dlkwn1,longarmman68,do not seek help ,i attempted to seek help a little bit ago  worst mistake i ve made  i was so close to killing myself  and then i thought that maybe i d give it a try to seek help  so i did the only thing i havent tried yet  i went to the e r  and asked the registration lady if there was anyway they could help me find a cheap therapist   she said yes  and i even asked her  if there was anyway they could keep me from leaving  and she told me straight to my face  no matter what happens  i can leave when ever i want  fast forward    mins  and they re taking all of my belongings and they lock me in a room with only a bed in it for    hours  with no food the whole time and no opportunity to bathe or change my clothes  then a cop came  handcuffed me and put me in the back of his car and drove me to a mental hospital  on the way there  i asked him if he could crack the window cause i was getting car sick  and he said   well you should ve thought about that before you got yourself put in the back of my car  he then dropped me off and then it was in the looney bin i went    while i was there  it took me   days to speak to anyone besides a nurse  and when i did finally see a psychiatrist and a therapist  they just basically just asked me the same questions the nurses had been asking me for   day  they then gave me a discharge day and left me alone  and i tried to ask to see the therapist again  the nurses told me that they would put my name on the list to see her and she would see me as soon as possible  i asked them to put my name on the list every single day until i left  and i never saw the therapist again    so i got out yesterday  and now i lost my job and my means of transportation  and i m gonna be homeless in about   days  i told the doctors that i couldn t afford to be taken to inpatient  and they would just ignore me and some of them even walked away from me mid sentence  now i m left with an e r bill i cant pay  and a huge bill for my imprisonment at the mental facility  so now they left me with no choice  the only thing seeking help has done for me is it helped me decide that killing myself was what i should have done in the first place ,depression

t3_dlkun8,philthekinger,i have to get some things off of my chest,the title is pretty much self explaining   i don t really have people to talk to because i m anxious of annoying people      also if i dont let this out in some way shape or form  i feel like my head ist going to explode   disclaimer  sorry for my poor choice of words every now and then  i m from europe and not a native speaker  i ve always had ups and downs  some down s lasted     days and some last weeks  lately i have been feeling miserable again but this kind of takes over now and doesn t really stop  until now  it always was like that i felt amazing on the ups and horrible on my down phases and at the moment i feel the worst i have ever felt  there is a constant feeling i can barely put into words  all i feel is anger  sadness  hopelessness and just sadness overall  on top of that down  i just moved out of my parents house into a bigger city  i had to due to me going to university  a good       hours drive away and i miss them like crazy  because i always had a good bond with my parents  in addition  to that and the down phase also comes the doubt and anxiety towards the path i m taking  currently i am studying at university in order to become a teacher and i have a lot of doubt about that  it s a cool thing to do but it s not the real deal to me  what i really wanna do is livestreaming but this is another story and a rather small reason to my constant bad moods and sadness     today i even started tearing up in the bus just because i reflected my current situation and i just couldn t help myself and exited as soon as possible  i just cannot help myself and have more suicidal thoughts than ever  meanwhile thats bringing me down aswell because i cannot leave me family behind  i just hate everything and i just wanna sleep all day  stay in bed and not do anything   ,depression

t3_dlk8w9,Helpmehelpsomeone2,how do i convince someone that life can be worth living  that things will get better ,a friend of mine is going through depression  it s gotten to a very bad point  unfortunately the only thing i could do  is convince her that things will get better and life is worth living  other than that  whether she ends up killing herself is out of my hands it seems  although i would blame myself for it     i have had a long history of depression myself  so i know for a fact that things get better  sometimes things will get worse  but then it will again get better   whenever i try to convince her of that  she ll say that  i don t want to get better  i just want to die   the conundrum in that is that if she starts feeling better  she wouldn t be angry about being happy and not wanting to die anymore   it doesn t help that she s bullied a lot at school for no reason other than kids being evil  she get s called names like  w      e  daily and her  friends  keep telling her to kill herself    from her perspective i guess the world is an evil place  i have tried to be a beacon of hope for her  but i m starting to fear that i m not bright enough to shine out all the darkness ,depression

t3_dlju1t,allstyle777,telling my story ,this year has been one of the hardest in my life  even if nobody reads this i think it will help for me to get it out there    i am someone who under normal circumstances suffers from depression and anxiety  and when my life isn t on fire medication and some therapy keeps me more or less good    but like this year has just been too much  just going to list all the things that have happened so far   my wife and i just bought a house and since have been a little house poor    this february our furnace died on a day when it was     f  we had to divert money we had saved for my wife s maternity leave to pay for it to be fixed    then we had plumbing issues to the time of     dollars    we then had our son which was wonderful and terrifying  my sleep evaporated   for a good cause but further exacerbated my mental health issues    after my paternity leave came the worst event  the day i returned from leave the owner of the small company i worked for told me he could no longer pay my salary  to my knowledge we had no money issues and i did not see this coming  this was my worst fear realized  not going to lie  for that day i got home and collapsed on the floor a total wreck    i scraped myself up and got out there with vigor to get a job  each rejection hurt more than it should have  each week that goes by without landing a job i feel more and more useless    while driving     miles home from a free lance gig where i made some good money   the alternator on my relatively new car died leaving me stranded    miles from home  the tow home and repairs i personally did all but negated the money i earned    i then landed a temporary gig where again my car had issues  at least this time i had aaa and the tow wasn t expensive  but i was stranded for many hours on a friday i was going to go home early and relax      weeks after that i had a really good interview somewhere that could be just the break i was looking for  i was on the phone with my wife  both using hands free  telling her about how great the interview was when she was involved in a car accident  an f     plowed into the back of her car  i heard her scream and glass breaking  she did not respond to me     seconds went by  i was frantic  i thought she had died  she then responded that she was ok abut needed to go  she had a major concussion whiplash and bruising all over her body  but she walked away   that s all i really cared about    this last week i was offered a really promising job with a great salary  i finally felt like things were taking a turn for the better  yesterday they retracted the offer citing that they wanted to cut costs    so today  i m just feeling defeated  i ve been treated like garbage and had so many things happen that i don t even feel like getting out of bed anymore  this is just the short version  there s things i m either missing or just not remembering  i just feel like so many shitty things have been happening i can t imagine life ever going back to a happy place ,depression

t3_dljpkh,anonTwat1,is anyone else here a bit of a workaholic  though possibly less so in the traditional school career sense  ,i m bipolar but can t post there on a throwaway and i spend a lot of time in depressive so here i am    i think i m a bit of a workaholic in that i m pretty much always working on something  productive   and it s quite common for me to be working almost nonstop  even while eating and on the toilet and so forth  from the moment i wake up to the moment i crash into bed   however  i m not really a workaholic in terms of school or jobs   i m still fairly ambitious  at a top school on a competitive course  going for a first and decent career  and also have a bad habit of agreeing to lots of extra shifts at my part time jobs  and strive to do well  but i tend to do the minimum amount of work required to succeed therein  and don t like going above and beyond with work  last year at university for example i literally got     overall to the nearest    which is what you need for a first   on the other hand  when it comes to personal projects and stuff like volunteer work and helping others  i constantly have ideas and slave away relentlessly past the point of exhaustion  i ll often pull all nighters and just sacrifice aspects of my life like sleep  eating  exercise  social life etc  to crank out as much work done as possible    i don t really know how to relax and rarely watch tv  play video games  go out with friends etc  anymore cause i feel like i m wasting time i could be being productive producing something  work is pretty much the only thing that brings me a sense of satisfaction meaning and makes me feel slightly less useless and pathetic in my existence  and just generally cynical and hopeless about the world   anyway i was just wondering if anyone else here is similar  i have some theories as to why i push myself to work so hard and think a lot of it stems from low self esteem  feelings of guilt  anhedonia  anxiety  existential dread etc  but am interested to hear why others feel like they might be this way    i know it may seem counter to depression  and i do go through periods of  worse  depression in total despair where i can t get myself to do anything  though i can normally now get into the mindset of it s better to stay alive doing  something  like volunteering than kill myself  and i somehow manage to push through the darkest periods    if you re still reading this i hope you have a nice day whoever you are    ,depression
t3_dljnv6,TryingToImprove0,i ve lost weight  now my depression is lifting ,just thought i d share this  for the first time in years i can actually feel my depression lifting  also i am no longer overweight after losing   lbs  i know you hear it all the time that exercise is the key  blah blah blah  my diet is terrible  the only thing i ve done is lost weight now my depression is incredibly reduced    i m probably just like you  i heard all the advice thrown my way and immediately think that it won t work  until it actually worked  i was so stuck for years to try and find a solution and now finally i ve done it  so i encourage you to just try something  for me it was slimming down  maybe for you it s just getting more time outside  spending more time with people in general  etc    giving up and accepting you re stuck this way not only harms you  it harms your family  friends  co workers  just try  you haven t got to go full grind mode  but trying means your moving  you may not see it in a week  a month or even a year  but it means you re moving away from your depression and towards a better future  that s all  from someone probably not so different to you ,depression
t3_dljl65,throaway635851,i am planning on ending it next year,i won t bore you with the long story about how i got here  long story short  verbally abusive father led up to me being really introverted and not speaking to anyone which led to a lot of bullying  life eventually got better  but my emotional state got worse and worse    the only reason why i did not do it until now was my mom  who would be devastated if she d lost me  another reason was my friends but i came to the conclusion that they do not care about me at all  how i m feeling and stuff  they just want me to live and that s it    i do not have enough money to pay for a therapy  nor any person i could talk to and no hopes for the future    the reason i chose next year is because i want to plan it very carefully  to make it look like i was kidnapped or something and to end up on the missing people list in the worst case  no one knowing that i actually died  summer      will be the perfect time  since it will be the end of my first year at uni and will plan a trip where i would go alone    why i m posting this here then you might ask  well  it is very hard to keep going even until then  and i felt sharing this with someone  anyone  will help me just for a bit ,depression
t3_dljfq6,Elite250,because of a series of unfortunate events  i seem to randomly lose my motivation drive,not sure if this is the right sub for this  i live most of my life pretty much normally without much mental distress until about   years ago  graduated top     in my university  i was extremely confident and was ready to start working and start my life as an adult  however  the reality was not as good as it seems  took me   months before i got my first job  which was through a friend  and it was a low pay job unrelated to my major with unclear prospects  i decided to use this as a stepping stone to get my foot in the door for future job hunts  fast forward   months later  i was bullied and gas lighted by my boss and had extremely toxic and backstabbing co workers  i had to leave the company  as i foresaw myself getting fired  as well as to save my mental health  had to see a therapist a couple of times to convince myself that the entire thing wasn t my fault  result of being gaslighted   losing my job also caused me to lose my residency in that country  i was a foreign worker   after trying to look for a new job for another   months with no luck  i decided to study again in another country   with this fresh start  i started to slowly regain my confidence and aced my classes  however    months into studying  my long term girlfriend of   years left me with no warning through text  it was a long distance relationship   this obviously caused a drastic drop in my confidence and motivation and i started flunking my classes  i also started to binge drink  practically intoxicated     of the time  the other    is the morning right before i drink my first drink  however luckily  through support from my newfound friends as well as family  i managed to pull through and was finally sober after   months  i am now with someone new  almost    months now  and is happy most of the time  however  i have this random spikes of negativity  which i didn t really have before having my first job  when i m in this negative  i am irrationally conscious of what people think say and is always in this weird fight or flight mode that i think everyone is the enemy  i also have occasional thoughts that people can just leave me anytime they want and no matter what i do now  there is nothing i can do to stop it from happening  probably because of the breakup   when i m in this mood  i also lose interest in doing things i usually like such as playing music and video games  it has caused minor inconveniences in my relationship  mainly my partner has to re assure me about certain things   and sometimes it makes me a little bit insecure and makes it hard for me trust my partner  or anyone in general  only when i m in this  mood    as i am graduating again  soon and i have to yet again enter the adult world  thinking about getting a job gives me bad memories and triggers this mood more often  i am not sure if anyone can relate to this   if you do  what are some things mindsets i can apply to alleviate these moods  also  is this common for anyone who were previously depressed  is this something that everyone goes through at some point in their lives ,depression

t3_dlj6d6,Kasha-UK,why does depression stop me doing things ,typically i would be classed as having  high functioning  depression  i don t spend all day unable to leave my bed  no shade on those who do  and can go do whatever i need to do    but i ll have bad phases where i ll have a few days where i ve nothing to do and everything slips   i ll not go to bed until  am  and i ll find i can t do a damn thing   then feel guilty for doing nothing but sitting on my phone or watching tv all day    for example i could do with going to the supermarket  second day in a row i ve just not been able to do it  yesterday i at least got to the shops across the road but it took hours to get myself to get washed dressed  even then i put in minimum effort   i m trying to beat the inertia now too just so i can go get some milk    what is it about depression that causes this  why do we experience this inertia and lack of motivation  i m not tired i just can t get into gear ,depression
t3_dlj47z,helpisneeded_,i dont know what s wrong with me,why am depressed  i have all the things that should provide someone with a happy life  i dont mean material things  i have a good job in my dream field  i literally have the job i wanted in my childhood  not only that it pays well i m comfortable i have a roof over my head  i can afford the luxarys i want  i m not rich by any means but i m comfortable  i m close with my family i have friends  i have a girlfriend who i love dearly who loves me  a woman i can see a future with  spend the rest of my life with    i think theres just somthing wrong with my brain with me as a person  i ve been to the doctors  i ve tried the medication  it helps somewhat but i still don t feel great about myself  i used to blame it on the loneliness but i met my girlfriend over a year ago   i m not lonely anymore yet i still occasionally feel like i want to fade away from the world  i used to have problems i could attribute to it but i ve worked on every one of them and yes i m in a better place than i used to be but i still feel like shit a lot of the time     i flicker from having a good time with my girlfriend or friends to wishing i was in bed asleep and having to pretend to continue to enjoy myself i just shut down randomly  i constantly feel like i m not good enough emotionally while logically knowing that i am  i haven t felt real motivation for years  i m waiting for everyone else to notice how much of a peice of shit i am then when my life is worth nothing no one will care what happens to me    i m a fairly selfless person  i like to help others with their problems because i feel valuable and because it distracts me from thinking about my own     my partner knows i struggle with mental health but i dont often share when i m feeling low because as i said before it can be randomly in the middle of having a good time i dont want to constantly kill any happiness we have together by proclaiming i feel like shit  i want her to have a good time that s my priority  she also struggles her self when she feels down she doesn t have the ability to function and put on a mask so i feel like it s up to me to be the strong one     nothing makes me happy  if it does it s extremely fleeting ,depression

t3_dlirob,Stefanbl96,widowed parent dating issue,hello everyone   i have an issue and would like to hear someone else s opinion   i lost my mother almost three years ago  she died from lung cancer  i m a very emotional person and very attached to my family  during her struggles  i was mostly away from home because i started studying at the faculty  i couldn t focus  always felt anxious and worried because of her condition  i had even hurt myself once    cuts on my forearm   she died when i was    years old  as time passed  it got a bit easier  but i m still unable to hold my tears and emotions when i visit her grave  or even see a picture of her in my phone  recently found out that my father started seeing another woman  i want him to be happy and not spend the rest of his life alone  but is it too much to tell him that i don t ever want to meet that woman or have any contact with her  i m not willing to even give her a chance or anything  i mean  i can live with them being together and everything  as long as i don t know any of it  it does sound very selfish of me to ask something like that  but she doesn t mean anything to me and i don t want her in my life  but i do care for my father and would like to have a good relationship with him  without involving her in there  if anyone has any advice or an answer to my question  i d gladly hear you out  because i m lost  i don t know what else to do ,depression

t3_dlipll,dylandarko16,i ve been listening to  the origin of my depression  by uboa and it s actually been very comforting ,i imagine most people have heard of this album through theneedledrop so think of this post as a sort of personal review since i use music like this for comfort when i m at my lowest   before i explain myself i need to be clear here  this album is dark  and not like listen before i go by billie eilish or anything like that  this album comes from a very  very personal place for uboa  the artist herself  at from what i understand was a very difficult time in her life  the sound is very sparse and ambient at times and shrieking and intense at others  it feels more like the soundtrack to a well paced horror movie  it s scary in a way few things can achieve and forces you to confront all these emotions in a way that is terrifyingly accurate and often uncomfortable  if you don t find comfort in dark depressing music i honestly think you should ignore this album despite how good it is imo   this album is incredibly dark and intense and i would only recommend it if you use music as a form of comfort and enjoy ambient industrial music  if you want an idea without listening to it  watch anthony fantano s review it s a good summary   to put it simply  this album contains blood curdling screams  glitchy ambience and strange samples that make it an album that has the ability to give you a panic attack  which it can and has done to me  but despite that so many moments on this thing left me breathless and beside myself  it s atmospheric as fuck and uboa has zero trouble facing her problems head on and she clearly put everything into making it   imo the biggest pros to this album are two things       the sound  when this album becomes distorted and glitchy it s uncomfortable but never unlistenable and the ambience hits you directly and can make anything and everything else fade away around you  the opening of the title song floors me every time  it s the kind of music that you need to listen to alone  in a room  at night for it to truly hit you  it s also worth mentioning that the album captures a lot of the moods that depression can take   quiet and reflective but also overwhelming and tormenting      the lyrics  honestly some of the best i ve ever listened to in an album that deals with these topics  the lyrics essentially act as stanzas of poetry that are either quietly and carefully delivered or screamed like the desperate cries of a murder victim  whichever one it is  they make the entire atmosphere of the album feel hopeless and weary in the best way possible and there are some disturbing  relatable and genuinely sad ideas on display  with titles like  please don t leave me  and  detransitioning  it s pretty clear that uboa is working through some stuff with it but in a way where the listener can twist it to fit their own feelings    it s about    minutes long and i d say worth a listen  if you are at that point where you can t sleep or just alone and having a really intense episode  this album can be comforting  i ve had it on for the last week along with deathconsciousness  another good album btw  and it s pretty overpowering    if you use music as a comfort i d seriously give this one a listen but be prepared for some intense sounds  emotions and production or this will knock you flat ,depression

t3_dlijrj,uglyman96,im ugly  really ugly ,most of my life i was rejected by almost everyone except my parents but they too joke about my appearance  which made me almost suicidal   imagine even your parents hate your looks   people also say it right into my face that i m ugly  never had a girlfriend and never had sex   i had to admit that i won t be getting this things in life and just accept everyone hated me without me even being able to do anything about it   no surprise  i got bullied in school and i couldn t make it far  now i m    years old  have a bullshit job i work for and still live with my parents   and then i hear people saying  beauty comes from inside  or  noone is really ugly   this simply isn t true and they probably won t ever understand unless they are in that situation themselves   i probably would have killed myself already if i haven t listened to alan watts and eckhart tolle they helped me alot to control my thoughts and emotions and i don t really take anyone s opinion that seriously anymore but it s still hard to live through this experience   i would describe myself as a rotten tomatoe only useful to feed the animals or something worse ,depression

t3_dli5oj,Debbie1300,love is not real ,it s a quote i live by everyday because my life couldn t any better and i feel like i drag anyone down because i ll never be good enough  i m so alone and miserable in darkness and there  will be no real life human connection out there for me just pure pity in how pathetic i am and how no one would ever want me need me or care for me because i can t imagine that  i m so boring and dull not even energetic because i don t do anything and i always thought maybe i deserve to be alone but it kills me a lot inside and i always hide it and it s also making me lose the ability to be high functioning  happy and to feel like myself again  sure some might say life is great when you have no one to look forward to and to spend time with because its ok to be alone and do good without anyone but for me it s not  i don t depend on anyone nor want to because no one takes me seriously   but it would be good to have someone  unfortunately i don t because people are far too busy and careless to even notice me love me or even hangout with me  the more i depend on wanting love from someone the farther its gets away from me because i ll always be attached to it by paying attention to it  love is hard to believe even though its mentioned a lot  because it s so complicated and annoying yet keeps you crawling back for it then drops you down like your worthless and i know i am  experiencing love would be nice and is a magnificent wonderful thing but instead i have hatred towards it because how much i ve been so poorly treated over the years  desires and expectations aren t met when it comes to love and therefore i don t care because when someone acts like they love me i don t believe them because they really don t  love for me is painful  and dreadful to deal with goes with how many times i ve been worthless and less appreciated not needed   i can t erase the fact that most people have someone except for me  which makes me feel worthless and unattractive and left out cause i m so average like who could ever like a girl like me  i m treated like trash  why even grab attention when i can t even flirt and besides i always feel the need to better up myself every time i m around a guy or want a guy  guys are just so picky and want a specific type of girl  same with me but opposite  people in society have it so easy to attract a guy or girl to be with and i end up being the one that all guys want to go away from and find someone better  people i know think i will find someone one day to spend the rest of my life with creating a false hope for me that will never come true  i could wait and wait a long time and i guaranteed no guy will ever like me  they d probably be busy  taken or cheat on me  depending on one and expecting one is a waste of time and i believe they can never satisfy a girl like me unless they think i m worth it which i m not  they rather a girl that is confident  sweet  kind well dressed flawless etc they make the effort  besides i m a complete failure and people manage their life and issues and do good better than i do and so i doubt think i will ever be ready for anyone,depression

t3_dlhsvv,Exoticarrno,the funny guy ,everyone knows me as i guess  the funny guy  and i guess i fit into the meme of the funny guy going home and being depressed   i don t know if i m really depressed though like i ve had a good life growing up  i ve been lucky and had a few people that care about me coming to school everyday and i apparently make people feel better but i have had bad thoughts of suicide and self harm for about two years now  i used a razor blade and cut lines all over my hands because i m too scared to do it anywhere else and i ve thought of countless ways of suicide but i ve never nearly have the courage to do it   i almost feel selfish reading through all of these posts of people with hard lives  abuse  years of depression yet i m sitting here with a lucky life and like a handful of people who care and that just makes it feel worse     if anyone reads this hope your doing good and you have a good day    ,depression
t3_dlhscj,alisonnes,depressed or just lazy ,first off  i m aware no one here can tell me if i m depressed or not   neither can i  so that s why i want to hear others experiences by creating this post  to see if i should seek help    i apologize in advance for the really long post  but hopefully someone is willing to read it  and hopefully they can somewhat relate        the past few months  probably even longer  i ve felt awful  a little backstory about me    i m almost    and a big part of my life i took online classes  and didn t attend public school  i tried a couple of times at age      and now    to attend a public school  last year i started at a new school right before summer vacation  i made some  best  friends  turned out they were both very toxic  and after months of being belittled  called ugly  left outside etc  i cut off all contact with them  and it felt amazing in the moment    now  it isn t all that great  all of that happened about a  year  ago  now i m not in school anymore  because i honestly just stopped going altogether    here s where the depression comes in     i don t have any friends  at all  i talk to no one  and i m home all day everyday  and i haven t hung out or interacted with anyone my age for the entire time since i stopped going to school  with no one  i truly do mean no one    i like being alone  i always have   but i don t like being lonely  and there s a massive difference  being lonely is the most suffocating feeling ever  and i don t know how to get better    everyone tells me   talk to people  initiate conversations  join a club  basically  a lot of people have been saying  just make new friends  as if it s that easy  my problem isn t social interactions  i personally think i do fine with that  how am i supposed to join clubs  though  when i can t even get out of bed in the morning   now  i m just at home       i watch some netflix  play some video games  or just lay in bed on the couch every single day  even the smallest of tasks are unbearable  i have a dog  and walking him is the most impossible thing ever  just getting ready will drain all of my energy   just taking on my shoes  getting up and making food for myself  even if it s just toast or cereal  is unbearable  showering  getting out of bed in the morning  it s all impossible     to some  that might just seem like typical teenager behavior   but personally it s stopping me from enjoying my life  it s difficult at any age to not have friends  but my teenage years is something i ll never forget  and being alone and depressed in them  is not something i want to remember them by     i m not sad  just kind of empty  like i have no motivation  no motivation to do anything at all  i can t concentrate on anything  and i can t do stuff i used to enjoy  i have nothing to look forward to  at all  it s been getting a lot worse the past month  a lot worse  to the point where i can t do anything an entire day  because i just don t know where or how to start  i feel like i m always tired  and on the verge of breaking  i feel everything and nothing at the same time  i can lay and stare and do nothing for hours and hours on end  and then a wave of extreme emotions will wash over me  and i ll probably cry  because i feel so shitty and helpless       btw     my dad was diagnosed with depression last year  and from what he s told me and my family  it s exactly how i feel  i know my family would be supporting  as we re a lot that has struggled with mental health   but i feel like i might just be overreacting  and i wouldn t want to seek help if that s the case   but i truly am doing awful    my question is now  based on you guys experiences with depression  does it sound to you like i m just being lazy  or do you think i should seek help  the waitlist here to a therapist or psychiatrist is pretty long  and can take as much as   months to see one     i know some people would just tell me to get my shit together and push myself to do all the things i m having trouble with ,depression

t3_dlg49b,chickenNCmugget,anti depressants are drugs that are able to convince your brain that the world is a nice place   when in reality it isn t ,obviously this doesn t always work  but this is how i feel  i mean  honestly  look at the world  do i even need to write down things that make it an awful place  just turn on the news  which i stopped doing  or remember that in order to be able to live on this planet you have to sell some of your time to do mostly useless jobs for a major corporation that almost always underpays you  yes  there are great jobs  but what does the majority on this planet do  great jobs with great pay and benefits  i don t think so   how can anyone not be sick in this society  but because suicide is a taboo  depressed people like me have to do therapy and take drugs and are just generally forced to stay alive by all means   people say depression makes you see the world in a more negative way than it actually is  but who needs depression for that  you will notice that the world is a generally negative  bad and evil place   except if you re rich and privileged   if you just pay attention   the world is a horrible place  our society turned it into one  people who are healthy are just able to deal with it or ignore it  people who are sick receive drugs and or therapy to make them able to deal with it or ignore it ,depression

t3_dlfigu,welcometo_myworld1,sally, if you haven t read my previous story  you won t understand this one   basically sally got her phone back and her parents have her her instagram  i went on her instagram and found out she is seeing her boyfriend again  i wrote i this note and i thought i would share     today is already gonna be a horrible day  it s     am currently and it s already complete shit   sally got her instagram back and her and her bf  are already dating again  i scrolled through all the messages and i ve had so many mental break downs  i just can t deal with it  she promised me she wouldn t get back with him because it would hurt her too much  but a few days ago i saw her wearing his bracelet  i should have known  bullshit  i can t believe after everything she put him through  they still want to be together  she put that kid through hell and back as if he already hasn t been through worse with his dead beat mother in the drug industry  she overdosed and almost died because of him  she just wants to throw that all away and be with him again  a part of me is happy that she found her true love  but that same part of me snaps back into reality and remembers how shitty the situation really is  i guess the grass  is greener on the other side  she is completely destroying her relationship with her parents  her future  and our barely their friendship  it just hurts me so much  that after everything she put me through she wants to just jump right back on that horse  she s gonna end up dead because of him  and get this  i have to go to school and face her  and all of this ,depression
t3_dlfgb6,suckthezucc,my boyfriend wants me to do more stuff during sex but that s rly hard for me and makes me not feel like he enjoys what i do now,so when he asked me to do stuff i get sad and don t feel good enough which then we don t have sex and i feel even worse but when i try to do the stuff i fail and feel just as bad i just hate this this is the second night in a row this had happened and then i just have to sit here depressed asf bc he feel asleep,depression
t3_dlffro,viral_snyde,thanks for putting up with me ,i ve been trying harder to get on with others and have some social interaction that wouldn t hurt me and i just realized i keep thanking people afterwards for the time they spent on me  like  wow  thanks so much for sacrificing your comfort to tolerate me for a few minutes  it really feels like a one step forward  two steps back sort of ordeal lately  cuddling up with my papa roach and seether albums listening to metamorphosis and finding beauty in negative spaces   i know that even if i get through this right now  i won t be able to truly move on until i process some things or just let them go  but i dont know where to begin to unravel things  i just have to keep telling myself things will get better eventually ,depression
t3_dlfbt6,Kwaad_Naas,i m broken,i feel more broken today than ever before  i lost everything and gave up everything to move to a place where i could atleast sleep under a roof    i lost my job but i still have the most loveable woman that i could ever ask for  but today my depression is getting me  i dont have the funds to afford medical help and continue my medication intake and i dont have the funds to see her im scared i will lose her  i am scared i am useless to her   i am scared i can t support her enough because of my illness    today i feel more alone than ever before but i still have her  i m not here to ask for financial help  money is the last thing i need to feel better  i know it will get better we all have to know that life is hard and struggling with this illness is the most horrible of things and when it feels everything is going wrong you cant help but feel hopeless but we have to still try and get better we stil have to stand up and fight against our own thoughts   we are only human and emotions can overtake our every thought but anyone that is going through what i am going through today should remember we are there for each other  we are not alone  stay strong   ,depression
t3_dlfazj,kmdnn,i took the anxiety off  using alprazolam   now there s only depression     and i feel like absolute shit,yes the title is poorly worded  this is actually more of a question than just a story  felt like this fit this sub more than  r anxiety since the majority of it is about depression   so after i told my doc i had some pretty bad anxiety when on ritalin  which he prescribed me for studying   adding to the anxiety i have even without ritalin  he prescribed me alprazolam  xanax on the us i think   i ll just call it that since it s shorter   and holy shit does this stuff work  basically all of my anxiety was gone    minutes after taking it  and this one isn t even expensive like the other stuff  amazing  right   no  kind of  now  i don t know if this is just because xanax took the anxiety off and the depression is just taking over saying thank god now i can ruin his life in peace  or it s actually one of the effects xanax has on you  but my depression feels much worse  before  on most days  i could actually function  i gave at least half a fuck about taking showers and especially studying  or anything  but now  holy shit i m lucky if i can read a single paragraph before trying to stab myself with the pen i m holding out of frustration  also no desire to play games  or use the computer  i use my phone to browse reddit and that s it  if i take ritalin i have   hours of   entertainment    where i kind of want to do things  but after that  it s back to hell    sorry for the yelling  the question is  is it actually the xanax directly causing this  zombie mode   or is it more of a side effect of xanax eliminating the anxiety  leaving the depression free to do what it wants   if it s the former then great  just switch meds  but holy shit if it s the latter  my depression has gotten much  much worse than i had thought   ironic that i spent so much time typing this thing  maybe i am just lazy  i ask myself this question every single hour of the day ,depression

t3_dlf9jx,lancaster115,the pressure is real,this post is a lot of me rambling on and speaking my mind and i apologize in advance if it s confusing  but i feel that i just needed to tell someone about my thoughts   can t sleep and it s usually like this every night  so why not spend my time posting about it  ever since the school year started  i ve grown to depend on using melatonin or weed every night to help me sleep because it s almost impossible to sleep naturally now  here s why   i literally keep myself and my mind busy throughout the whole day so i don t get stuck in my own thoughts because it is almost entirely full of negativity  the only time i do get stuck in my own thoughts is when i am about to sleep and that almost always keeps me awake    i finished two years of college and ended up getting put on academic leave for my bad grades  because i lost the motivation to go to school and do homework  i blame both my anxiety from having to go to classes as well as my laziness  my dad then convinced me to do a semester of online courses at a community college  which i have also lost motivation to do  the shitty part about this is that my dad keeps believing that i ll do better and decides to waste his hard earned money to help me get through school  i already have one brother that has completely failed him and i am getting close to that  it just eats me up inside every time i get stuck in my thoughts  because in a way i m using him for spending money on a lost cause  i could ve never asked for a better dad  honestly  i wish i could prove myself in school  but just can t for some reason    after    years of constantly disappointing my dad with my horrible grades throughout elementary  middle and high school  i think it s just finally hit me of how much i am putting my dad through    i ve heard that working out really helps getting your thoughts straight and all  but i ve been working out nonstop for   months now and  nothing  it doesn t seem to be helping with anything except my physical appearance    about every night  i think  why not just go into my garage and end it now  wouldn t that just be easy for everyone and not have to be another useless and disappointing son  i then persuade myself to not do it just yet  i want to live life and try finding someone to care for  i have this small amount of hope that having a partner that i can love will help me get my life back on track  i am even pursuing that love right now  with a girl i ve known as a coworker for   months  but i m scared at the same time lol  it could definitely fail  who knows ,depression

t3_dlejwd,somedewche,i wish i could let go of my sexual perversion and suicidal ideations,sometimes i go out at night walk around and i m comforted by the possibility that being a small lone female with no form of self defense means i might get lucky and get murdered  i ve been through some truly hellish things in my short life and i d rather go out now while i m still young  society doesn t seem to care much for older women and i am pretty shallow with a lot of narcicisstic traits it feels damn near impossible to envision things getting better for me in terms of living a humble  functional and fulfilling life wherein i can be an actual blessing in other humans lives and don t constantly rely on others to have my needs met  i believe i am on the autistic spectrum  older men in general seem to be attracted to me but i don t wanna be too comfy with that scenario cause they re a bunch of shallow fucks  too   being a musician entertainer narcicisst i seek out activities where i can feel most appreciated  amp  admired or at the very least feel numb but i ve finally begun to pray about my emotional dependency on alcohol  i m sure i can kick it but likely be one of those miserable bitter sober people that don t really do much to address the root issues  as far as my ego goes i can t imagine changing how i see life  the world and myself  i have wished to be murdered for a long time but being sexually assaulted or entangled in psychologically abusive exploitative relationships is as close to that as i seem to ever get  i ve been celibate for a minute and at the very least i have the self awareness to realize i don t seem to know how to treat people and am wickedly jealous insecure  against my better judgement i still hope someone will kill me  soon enough and quickly  humanely  enough ,depression

t3_dleive,princ3vinc3,i don t know about anything anymore ,i m in my room  it s       am currently  i m laying down with the lights off  and i just feel lonely  i feel sad  i feel like shit overall  my dog just died today  she was kind of the only thing i would talk to or play with ti get my mind off of things and feel better about stuff  now i don t have that  i talk to this girl who is my ex but we still talk on the phone every night  its a long distance thing   and she hung up earlier tonight because she wanted to fall asleep to music  so i been left alone kind of just feeling like crying about just my life in general  i miss her  i miss my dog  i miss my dad who died   yrs ago   i just wish i can just have people who i love to just be there literally      which i know is unrealistic but its something i feel will help me because nothing else is working    i feel a lot of my depression currently for the past   months has revolved around this girl  we click soo much  we get along  we know each other  we understand each other  its a very very deep connection i feel towards her that i havent felt before  i feel like she s a second version of myself in a way  but since we broke up   months ago  things changed  as expected  we stopped really talking all day everyday  she kind of did  i still wanted to talk all day everyday but she refused because she wanted to put herself first and not be so invested into putting her time and effort into me  so its to a point now where we are barely kind of getting back to talking  she hints at certain things  she wants me to say i love her  we even started making sexual little insinuations toward each other and it s nit been brought up as an issue so its kind of just confusing me in a way  she didn t want to be calling me everyday anymore for the simple fact she feared i would get attached and start expecting her to do it and i would get sad or mad if she didnt and now that she s been calling every night for the past almost    days now  i m feeling like im getting attached because now everytime she hangs up i m right back to feeling sad and missing her  i dont know  i just really want to just not talk to anyone for at least a day  but she s the only person i talk to and i can t resist texting her back or anything at all  it s just so frustrating  the sad part is i been putting up a front as if nothing is a big deal to me anymore and she s believing it  she don t know in reality i still want to talk to her  i still want to even be with her still  she just dont know  she thinks i ve changed but i really haven t  i ve just been suppressing my desire to talk to her this way she wont see how attached i am to it and end up not talking to me as much anymore ,depression

t3_dlefhh,PhrygianNoodles,i was fucked over by the education system and life,all of the good jobs available these days involve technology and math  these are the fields that are growing and promise a stable income  for my entire middle school  highschool  and now college experience  i have had but one decent math teacher    of them have been after i had them  and the rest are notorious for being mediocre teachers only in it for the money  i feel i was robbed of a math education and now only know up to algebra   and statistics  i feel like there are entire swaths of information missing that can never be replaced  critical thinking skills i lack because we would learn only   chapters in an entire year  no child left behind bullshit     i m good at humanities  writing  and analytical thinking  but problem solving is a real struggle for me  it seems like i m damned if i take a degree where my strengths are at because no career attached to them can pay off the debt it costs to attain them  but i m also damned if i go into a tech math field where everyone else has an advantage over me    i know there is the medical field but i have actual homophobia that will render me unconscious or nauseous  also  i m not good with my hands but more of a brainstormer writer    i see these career lists with various managers and engineers topping out in income and there are no humanities represented  it s as if all of my weaknesses are what this world functions on and it s very demoralizing  i constantly am trying to become smarter and better at critical thinking but i know my brains developmental potential is pretty much over and i m just wasting my time    trying to learn computer coding languages was seeming pretty easy because i have a natural gift for languages  but trying to make sense of actual code  like creating an order of operations and understanding how things work together  it is panic attack inducing for me  i cant visualize a detailed system in my mind  i m only good at seeing the big picture and guessing where something might fail  i can t contain the information for how one action plays into another efficiently  it s a huge weakness for me  and all of the psychology tests i have done have said the same    i have a great memory to where i can pass college classes without taking notes or studying  but i rely on memory recall triggers and odd associations i make  i can t see all the information at once or anything like that    i m worried i ll be some worthless nobody making    thousand a year substitute teaching because that s the only viable option i see right now that plays to my strengths and isnt extremely debt inducing  it still is to some extent     i m watching my friends begin trade apprenticeships that will end with them making        k dollars a year  they will be able to raise families and enjoy life  i ll always just be scraping by   i m too physically fucked up to work a job like that  i m only    and nearly all of my joints already show serious damage to the cartilage and i hurt all the time  i dont know why because i never physically overexerted myself  i just have weak  brittle joints and bones    as it is i work a minimum wage job       hours a week and am hit with car trouble  medical bills  college fees  and more all the time  i m not able to save but     or     dollars a paycheck and it feels like its adding up to nothing when i see college tuition costs of   k a year  conservatively  in my future    there isnt even a career i want to do which is another big problem  i ve been depressed my entire life and have thought about killing myself daily since i was   years old  its just part of my routine now  i break down and cry at the end of every day and feel the hopelessness wash over me  it s only been amplified by bad decisions i made in highschool that damaged my brain even further    i just have no passion for anything even though i force myself to have hobbies and exercise  life is really hard for me and none of my friends show any support  they are all sociopaths who hardly believe in emotions and sure as hell wont allow me to show any  i m hated by everyone else in the community  i made a lot of enemies when i was young   and i cant leave my friends because they would be vengeful and ruin my life as they have threatened to do   i just feel really stuck and directionless even though i m working harder than i ever have in my life  my mom and grandma just died and my dad has terminal cancer so things arent good at home either  i dont go to school full time so i dont get the free therapy access and i have no health insurance to pay for any outside of that  i m really struggling to find some path that can give me enough money so i dont have to worry about this all day every day ,depression

t3_dldydl,smilingfemalemachine,one is the loneliest number ,this post is probably going to be all over the place  but so are my thoughts  so please hang in there   my entire life  i ve been constantly abused  friendships  relationships  family  i ve been molested  raped  hit  gaslit  cheated on countless times  financially abused  emotionally abused  psychologically abused  you name it  it s all i know   i m honestly a really modest person  but i know i m loving  caring  empathetic  driven  loyal  honest and i do my absolute best to be a good person in every aspect  i m not perfect  and i don t think  anyone  deserves the abuse i ve been through  but i especially don t understand why it happens to me  i m not confrontational  i m not a controlling bitch  i m pretty easy going  generally speaking   because of my history with abuse  at this point in my life  i m realizing that i don t trust  anyone  anymore  at all  i let people in just fine and consider myself to be an extremely open person  i don t hide things or try to keep people out  i m a truly open book and nothing is off limits  but letting people in just makes me trust them even less  it s like agreeing to babysit kids you know are monsters  yes  i let you into my house  i signed up for this  knowing what i was getting myself into  but now i have to watch every single move you make so i know you re not breaking all my shit since you re here   my parents divorced when i was   and my dad died in an accident at the ripe old age of    when i was     we didn t have the best relationship for much of my life  but just when things were getting better and i felt close to him for the first time  he died  and it fucked me up for years  and now  almost    years later  i m realizing how much my relationship with him fucked me up too   i ve always craved love and affection  i ve never really gotten it from anyone  aside from maybe my mother  i ve been married  gotten divorced  been in relationships  had deep meaningful friendships that dissolved into nothing  nothing lasts forever  i understand that  but i m a true hopeless romantic and i want that  forever  more than i ve ever wanted anything  and i think that s why i ve tolerated so much abuse and neglect  just because they were bad to me sometimes didn t mean they were bad to me  all  the time  and if they  loved  me  then i was just compromising with myself  that s how i looked at it   i m in a relationship now with someone i am absolutely crazy about  he is everything i ve ever wanted and more  we haven t been together long by any means  officially together for only about a month  but i already feel all kinds of ways about him that i ve never felt for anyone  even my ex husband  we spend time together every chance we get  sometimes for days straight  but i don t even trust  him  and it breaks my fucking heart because i want to so badly  i pretend i do  i m not trying to overstep any boundaries and make him think i m some possessive bitch  but i m constantly wondering why it s taking him so long to text me back or what he s doing when he seems preoccupied or why he didn t answer his phone  and it makes me feel so horrible  i don t pry and just act like everything is fine  and he honestly seems none the wiser  it s not like i m completely irrational  there  are  occasional things present that would generate concern from a normal person  but a normal person would give him the benefit of the doubt  i can t   i ve felt like this in every relationship  whether it was justified or not  and as far as friendships go  i m constantly telling myself that they re just my friend because they feel bad for me  or that they have something to gain from me  things like that  i m not close to any family  aside from my mom and my stepdad and one of my siblings  but i don t  really  trust any of them either  they ve all hurt me or lied to me at some point  i don t expect anyone to be perfect  i just want the same unconditional love and loyalty and commitment i have to offer to be returned   no matter who s around  i always feel completely alone  and i m too insecure of a person to be as independent as i ve had to be  and i know i m not the only one that feels this way  but that isn t at all comforting  i ve never felt so down  i don t want to kill myself  and i don t want to die  i just want to sleep and wake up when everything doesn t suck anymore   idk if anyone will actually read this  and idk why i m even posting this  guess i just needed to vent about it to strangers online because i don t have to pretend to trust any of you   anyway  if you  did  read this  thanks  i hope you re having a better day than i am ,depression

t3_dldt0d,dogcatmoose,just needed somewhere to vent about my life right now,as of right now in my life  i feel like i have nobody to talk to about my issues so here i am to spew my guts  clinically  i ve had major depression and anxiety for over a year now  but i ve suffered way longer than that  i m on two different antidepressants and i don t think they re enough anymore  but then again  my life has overall been hectic the last few months so i think it just might be in my head  bear with me  this is going to be all over the place    to put it into perspective  i m a third year nursing major  too much stress  but in the end it will be rewarding  and i m someone who is also very hard on themself  i expect myself to be perfect and do perfect  when i m not  i kind of spiral out of control and everything collapses along with it  i failed one of my major classes tests  which isn t like me  but it coincides with everything else happening    i had a relationship from april until the end of august and it was beyond toxic  i cringe over how foolish i was and how i allowed myself to be treated because i thought it was  love   obviously  it wasn t and i was terribly upset during the entire relationship  the guy i was with was manipulative and knew how to mold me like clay  i m not proud of what i put myself through because lots of people told me i deserved better  i knew i did  but i loved this person so i stayed  i thought i could fix him  i thought i could heal all his wounds  but by doing this  i reopened all of mine that i had worked months to heal  he ended up moving back to school and i wanted him to commit to me  but he wouldn t  i spent a good month thinking i wasn t good enough for him or anyone even though i put him on a pedestal and put up with his lies  i never thought i would end up in an emotionally abusive relationship  but here i am  booboo the fool    fast forward a few weeks from that episode  my friend persuaded me into downloading tinder so i could get over this guy  i didn t want to because it felt dirty and wrong  but i knew i needed a distraction  this was a whole ass mistake and for anyone reading this  don t be stupid like i was  i matched with this guy who was a friend of a friend  and i was coaxed into pursuing him  everything was wonderful  like a story tale  i couldn t believe i was finally getting what i had longed for  well fast forward to the present  all good things come to an end and he just wants to remain friends  that just added to my shit pile  when i have interest in someone  i develop feelings fast and hard  it s all biting me in the ass now   a few weeks ago my best friend and i had a falling out  she has been battling her own demons and i love her to death  she knows that i ve been battling my own too  but together  our battles become completely exhausting  we both agreed we needed room to breathe to try and heal but of course we said we would still be here if we needed each other  i m used to talking to this girl all day every day about stupid shit  i ve felt lost without her and i ve expressed this to her  it s just that things have been very hard for her  i respect her needs of course  it s just difficult when your main emotional support is missing  usually  she s the one i would be running to to discuss everything i am in this post  but she s not here    half the time i don t even know how to put into words how i m feeling  i constantly feel like i have something sitting on my chest  there s always a lump in my throat  the only time i feel most normal is when i fake it going to class  work or eating dinner with my family    i know that some may suggest i talk about how i m feeling with my family  except we re not that kind of family  we each are very private and deal with things on our own  it s not the healthiest  but i guess it s what works for us as a unit    if you ve read this far  thank you  i know i probably sound dumb as my issues are very minute compared to others  i just needed to vent and get it out so i would stop crying and hopefully go to sleep  there s so much more going on with me personally  but this post is already long so i m going to cut it short    i plan on talking to my primary about getting referred to a therapist psychiatrist and maybe altering some of my meds to help improve my daily quality of life    and a reminder for those of you who struggle like me  there are brighter days ahead  keep trucking along and you are not weak for wanting or looking to receive help  you are strong and your journey isn t over yet  it may feel like the end of the world  but i promise  it s not ,depression

t3_dldlpp,louisamargo,i feel miserable because of school  what should i do ,to be honest  i ve never really been one to love school or be the most motivated  but i ve always had quite good grades nonetheless  about two years ago  i started feeling pretty horrible and depressed for no real reason  but i still went to school and last year i had the best grades yet  this year though    th grade  i hate going to school more than ever  i used to have tons of friends but during the time i got so severely depressed  i became close friends with some people i actually didn t like at all  just so i wasn t alone  this year  i was very motivated to  do me  and pushed those friends away  which made me feel very guilty and i think hurt them a lot  too  i changed a lot  i felt lost and didn t know where i belonged to  and to be honest that s still the way it is  i ve never felt this alone  most days i can t even fall asleep and before going to school i start crying and having panic attacks  i can t concentrate when i m in school because i just keep thinking about all the things i ve fucked up and how unhappy i am  i have tried everything  every bit of advice i got  i m in therapy  i do a lot of stuff outside of school  i talk to my mum about it a lot and she absolutely understands and supports me  i considered changing schools but found out it isn t possible for my school to change in the middle of the school year  nothing seems to make this feeling of numbness and darkness and hopelessness and most of all  this feeling that i m trapped in this excruciating routine  go away  every morning when i drive to school by bike  i wish for a car to hit me  this morning i woke up knowing that i would have to spend   hours in school and i just couldn t do it  i asked my mom to have me stay at home and now i m laying here not knowing what to do  feeling like i ve screwed up once again  now i m even more behind on school work  and other than that i can t skip school just because  and if i start doing that  it s not going to stop  there s just this big hole of darkness inside my heart and i feel like i m underwater and everything is very far away  very detached from myself  the days are just going by as i drag myself from room to room  from one torture to another  at the end of the day  i feel so tired that i can t do anything other than watch some stupid tv before falling into bed  also  for two years  ever since my unhappiness started  i ve been consistently picking at my pimples every day  it used to be so bad that i would spend hours in the bathroom  until i would bleed and the throbbing pain would be too much  my skin now is nearly perfect but i still find ways to poke at it  and on days where school was especially bad  i will do it for hours  i know this was a lot to read  but i think i really just needed to get this out  there s a lot more i could add but this is probably what s bugging me the most right now  i don t know what to do anymore  i know i should just get through this because it s only one year before our classes get mixed together  but the year s only started and i literally can t take it anymore  the thought of having to get through this agony every day for a whole year makes me feel so hopeless i want to drop out altogether ,depression
t3_dldj6s,lusynn,art,i just wanted to ask people who are engaged in arts not as a hobby  but for whom art is all their life  the meaning of existence  do you think that periods of depression in your life contributed to creativity or hindered growth  quite a lot of stories about artists who created their best masterpieces during the depression period and they became known to the whole world  but there was much more unwritten about those artists whose depression broke and no one heard about them   gt  sorry for my english  i know its bad   lt ,depression

t3_dlczvx,ILikeMyAnimosity,i need to  vent  and i am posting to reddit to do it ,funny  how i have reached a point in my life where i am posting to reddit  so  to whoever ends up reading this  lets begin  i ve been around here for a couple of months but never said anything  i feel really selfish for posting here now but i feel as if i don t have any other choice   i am at my lowest point in   years  i saw it getting worse and worse over the past month or two  maybe even longer but i didn t act on anything because i never thought i would get this bad  it certainly wasn t a slow decline and was a rapid decent into this  i am posting here because i just need someone to read this   friday  i ended up leaving school early because i just couldn t bring myself to stay i was a broken down mess of a teenage boy  who sat in a toilet for an hour and half in tears  i ve  skipped  school because i feel like shit and i don t even feel safe going  i am extremely demotivated about doing any form of school work and with exams coming up this isn t helping  the thought of going back to school is absolutely destroying me mentally and emotionally  i am struggling to get myself to do even remotely anything that i enjoyed  everything feels so difficult and tough to do  nothing brings me joy and i just sit there not enjoying anything  playing games  talking to friends  reading books and writing  nothing is enjoyable for me anymore  i ve taken to sleeping during the day a massive amount to just escape the emptiness  loneliness and sadness that i feel  yet  i still wake up drained and overly tired as if i haven t slept for days  i barely eat anything or keep myself hydrated correctly   recently  i decided i needed a break from my friendship group  as i was coming home everyday feeling extremely lonely and in pain  in the end  they where affecting me negatively and for the worse and i felt that was also projecting onto them  i explained i needed a break but would still be friends with them all  and they where all supportive of the decision without a question asked as to truly why   although  i feel as if they aren t happy about it and are talking behind my back but that is hopefully my anxiety talking and not the truth   yet  i am now feel extremely guilty and like a traitor to all of them  that i ve somehow just stabbed them in the back and hurt them trying to do right by myself for once  i ended up talking to the one friend who i don t feel lonely and really shitty around and asked them if they wanted to do more together  thankfully  they said yes but i can t help but feel extremely guilty for asking such a question  i have sent them a few other messages trying to explain things and apologise for it  they are super understanding and supportive but my own guilt wants me to keep going and i have to actively force myself away from any form of digital contact with them for a little while  as i feel like an annoying pest  they told me i ain t annoying but i still feel like i am   the worst part about all of this  is that i am once again having suicidal thoughts and relapsed and cut myself   i didn t draw blood or have to clean anything up   i broke down crying when i truly processed what i was doing and went and took a shower that was way to hot  i am stuck up at night for hours just thinking about killing myself or hurting myself  every waking hour i want to die or hurt myself to make it just go away  i feel so worthless and empty  i really want it all to be over right now   ah hell  i m sorry for doing this but i just don t know what else to do right now ,depression

t3_dlcj1i,elquoi,she left with the cats and any hope of my redemption,long story short  she lied to the police    and while in suffered through the terrifying loss of freedom sacrificed for her inability to wrestle with guilt     but the time i got back  the cats   my children    were gone    and in those final days  she claimed fear and the victim card  oh she was so scared to be around me despite my never ever laying a finger on her  my years of bending over backwards to make her happy     but she was the one who assaulted me  she was the one who robbed me of my freedom  but frankly  society never believes the guy   and with good reason  i suppose    no  i never pressured her for sex  in fact  i d go months until she was comfortable    and that was probably a mistake  but i thought i was being a good life partner  i didn t realize that i allowed a lack of oxytocin interfere with her selfishness   unless i really am that bad  and if so  i deserve to die    anyway  i just want it to be over  or    i just want to see my cats ,depression

t3_dlcemu,ganralph,self destruction as a goal,during the lower times of my depression  it s almost as if self destruction is the ultimate goal  i have bad coping mechanisms not because i think it s making me feel better but because i know it s bad and harmful and that is the reason i want to do it to myself,depression
t3_dlcdf8,Who_U_Calln_Pinhead,i m suicidal and i have nobody,i m    and i m getting professional help for my depression  that s the only good thing i have going for me at the moment  i have no friends or supportive family with me  all my mom does is make jokes about finding me dead in the closet   i m not exaggerating  she legitimately makes suicide jokes about me quite regularly   my father is also mentally ill and a narcissist  despite me telling him that i go to therapy and have recurring nightmares about his abuse  he doesn t care  he just tells me to take some xanax  my sister      lives outside of the country but is the only support i have    today we got into an argument  she  said  i can listen to you all day  but when i get upset about something its a problem   to add further context  she got upset about something that is completely out of our control  i really couldn t help her and i told her that it s out of our hands  i also made an inappropriate joke that she took offense to  but i apologized for all of that  she called me an asshole and accused me of invalidating her   i always make an effort to be there for her and ask her how she s doing  even on the days where i can hardly get out of bed  but i understand that i may not be there enough  i really make an effort to not mention my problems too often  because i don t want to be a burden  so i asked her if i really talk about my problems that much  my sister backtracked and said no  but i feel like she was just lying to spare my feelings     she said a lot of hurtful things in the argument  but that line really fucked me up  like i can t stop thinking about it  she is literally the only support i have and i really try not to bother or upset her  i even asked her a few weeks ago and she said it was fine  all of a sudden i m this burden to her  i honestly don t see the point in sticking around if i m a nuisance to the only person who cares  i get how difficult it is to deal with a person who is depressed  i just really feel like shit  i m trying in therapy  i m trying to not be a nuisance  but i feel like i m failing at everything     tldr  i m just a fuck up   edit  my mother is lovely and i don t think she really wants me to kill myself  she just doesn t understand mental illness and takes it as a joke  even so  her suicide jokes still make me uncomfortable ,depression
t3_dlcdea,Erinb1217,my mind is killing me,i feel like this sick twisted person that does nothing but destroy my own happiness   i have this raging mind that constantly wants to be heard but no one will ever be able to listen because it s not only dark but it s like a magnet that pulls everybody in it s path and i hate that  i m a nurturing person with knives for hands so i see someone who needs something for their heart and i go to fill it to only drain it  i write music and paint masterpieces in efforts to deflect how horrible i am inside  i sing about love to hide that sometimes i don t feel anything  i paint oceans and mountains to escape the darkness in my head  and when i admit to anyone how dark and sad i am  they don t believe me because of all the brightness i bring  i don t get it and i want to  i want to be happy and i want sunshine  i want to feel everything good without all the bad drowning it out  but how ,depression
t3_dlcd14,jackbutt37,nothing makes sense,does anyone else feel like just nothing in their life makes sense  like everything about my life feels wrong and honestly it may just be better to end my life  everyone talks about finding what you enjoy and following that but there is nothing i enjoy  just daily tasks become hell because i have to put on my smiling face and act like my life is as amazing as people seem to think it is  i have no direction and at this point i m just tired of being a failure ,depression
t3_dlcc3k,DreamingIndianBot,dreamt about her last night ,it s been around   year since we broke up  it was mostly my fault for not being a good boy friend  she tried her best for   months  best of my life  to keep things together but there was not much common in life except the fact that we loved each other    we broke up last year same day  somehow she moved ahead while i am still stuck with this life  not even a day has passed when i didn t missed her    now she has a boyfriend  they both are in love with each other so much that they got matching tattoos with each other names  maybe they are more happy together than we were     ever since she moved on  i am in depression type feeling  can t confirm  because i don t know what other feels  but for me it hurts  now nearly every night i dream of her and in all dreams she leaves me in the end  no matter how the dream proceeds  the end is always she leaving me   tried my best to move on  but couldn t  tried alcohol  drugs etc all  i haven t shared these feelings with anyone  and i don t think i will ever share  mostly because people don t care  even if i share it will somehow make me look pathetic looser  somehow writing it here  i don t know if anyone understands me  i know people here don t care and will ignore this  that s ok because no one has enough time for a looser like me      ,depression

t3_dlc75p,feed_me_happiness,i often wish my mom would pass so i can die too ,let me preface this with a disclaimer  i have no intention or interest in harming others    i can remember wanting to die from as early as elementary school   home life was rough  but not nearly as bad as others have had it  i ve generally been blessed with a great life  i can t understand why with all i ve been given  i can t seem to find the drive to find my own joy or why i have such trouble finding joy in life  life to me is just a waiting game to find ultimate peace in death  i used to spend all my time sleeping but lately i can t even do that right   the only thing holding me back from actively pursuing an accelerated demise is the guilt of burdening my mother and my best friend with having to deal with the aftermath of my suicide  so i selfishly wish they would hurry up and expire so i could get on with it instead of having to get up every day and put on my face and do the same meaningless things over and over again  on the other hand  the last thing i want is for them to die   they lead such beautiful lives and are such kind souls  they have so much to offer in life   but if they did      maybe i could finally be free ,depression

t3_dlc3x7,foundthefurry,my completely mangled sexuality,i don t think i ve seen other posts about this here but i just want to vent  depression has completely ruined my sexuality and just turned it into a mangled pile of burning tires    i ll be honest  i hadn t quite figured it out before i got depressed  but depression sure made sure i locked down that confusion and didn t go anywhere with it  am i straight  who knows  i like girls most of the time but sometimes getting down with a guy sounds fun  am i bi  maybe  except i ve never been with a guy so maybe i m actually gay  everyone else seems to know  why can t i answer such a simple question about myself  to add to this somehow i m also trying to figure out if i just really like feminine things or if that actually means something deeper     then you add in depression just killing your sex drive overall  i can t speak for anybody else but damn  depression doesn t kill my sex drive  it kills any attempt to go out and meet people and try to get a relationship or fling going  but it doesn t kill your sex drive  so it just turns into me staying at home rubbing one out literally just to force my early   s hormones to just chill for a second  any kinks i have have slowly dissolved into a puddle of  meh  and stuff i would ve died to have done to me before depression hit just seem like another item  it s such a weird thing seeing everyone else with sexual interests and clear turnons when you don t really have any anymore    i m just tired of it  i want to go back to feeling normal and feeling like i had myself figured out ,depression
t3_dlc3js,fakepebong,i keep thinking about how it would be better if i died or just didn t exist anymore,since i started having depression  when i feel extremely sad and lonely  i think about how good it would be to be dead or just vanish and not exist anymore  because i know that the things that makes me unhappy and sad won t change and there is nothing i can do  on the other hand  i will never be able to kill myself  i can t even imagine the pain i would feel and how desperate i would be  not to mention the fact that it would be something terrible for my family and might destroy their life aswell  but i don t know what to do anymore  i want things to get better and i try it  but nothing works  any help  advice or just kind words are welcome  sorry if it was long ,depression
t3_dlc37t,iced007,i am just there and i see no point in life,at this point in time  i don t remember how long i have been depressed  it just feels like i have always been depressed  sometimes i get a caffeine high or hookah gets me excited and i like to call it bite sized joy because i only get small pieces of it  i think about ending my life a lot but i also think about what the point of all life form is and if i could  i would destroy the planet in a push of a button ,depression
t3_dlc2zc,matheman42,wanting to not exist is not selfish   ,i get people use this argument but why is anyone else s sadness a reason why you can t end your suffering  if i really think it would be worth it to not be here why is it anyone  else s decision  shouldn t people argue more to find my own happiness instead of guilting me for potentially making others sad if i were gone  seems like a crappy argument and i just want a better perspective than my mind is giving me   thanks in advance for any good perspectives,depression
t3_dlc2pr,GG-92,love is my drug,i m    and i ve had treatment resistant depression for    years now  i also have anxiety  ocd and autism spectrum disorder  i ve tried     medications  various natural remedies  cbt  dbt and tms and i m getting ready to try spravato soon  sometimes my depression will lessen  on two of the meds  but for the most part my life has been a black hole  the one and only thing that seems to bring me out of depression is being in a relationship  that dopamine rush when i feel loved is really the only thing that breaks through in any way shape or form  i don t understand why and it s frustrating to no end because i don t want to rely on anyone for my happiness and it creates unhealthy relationships  hence my current single status for almost a year  does anyone else experience this  how do you cope  it s so hard when the one thing that feels like a cure is mostly out of your control   i also wonder if this is any indication of what is actually wrong with my brain and what might actually finally help ,depression

t3_dlc0br,passion4ass,risk vs  reward   wellbutrin ,good evening from california  hope you all had a great weekend  this is one of the few posts i ve made to reddit  so i apologize if i m making errors with how i address this  but i was hoping to gather some advice from people with more experience than i have  i was originally put on wellbutrin about a year ago for my anxiety   idk what they were thinking lmao   but i quit taking it about   months ago due to a mental fog i feel like i developed and also a grand mal seizure   although i did do heavy drinking the night before  i know  big no no  i was otherwise sober for the treatment   but the honeymoon phase was phenomenal for me  i found a new love for life i never knew i could have  since coming off of it  i ve had some life changing events that furthered my pre existing mild depression into a severe one which i m having a harder time coping with each day  nothing brings joy  sex drive is chatting with satan in hell s depths  i feel terribly unwanted  and i ve lost this charming confidence i used to be praised for  the seizure thing is obviously the biggest draw back from maybe trying it again  but i really think that it made me a better  and happier person   i d like to talk to my doctor about this and figure out an optimal method of addressing this  but i m worried of having my drivers license stripped away  or being blacklisted from using it regardless of my misuse with alcohol the night before the seizure      additional info i may have skipped   i was on    mg for two months before being bumped to    mg    the seizure occurred about a month and a half after being bumped to    mg     my low sex drive is affecting a potential relationship i m building with somebody i care very much about  my name on reddit holds no meaning anymore        i m a    year old male      i have tried zoloft  but only felt lazy and the thought of feeling lazy just added to my anxiety   depression       my apologies for the lengthy post  just seeking advice from people who may have been in the same boat or can offer some insight into my situation  if you ve made it this far  thank you so much for your time reading  i really do appreciate it  i look forward to hearing from you guys  i find myself peaking in here just to be amazed by the community you guys have established here ,depression

t3_dlbwph,bbrown3212,really long post ahead  really would appreciate any and all input ,so i ve struggled with depression since i was a kid  i ve tried suicide before and have made multiple suicidal threats and gestures  this is coming from someone who has had every opportunity in the world to succeed and have been lucky enough to have a great supportive family  however i constantly feel like i m letting them down and myself down with not completing college  i ve been in college since i was    and am now     throughout my time in college i have failed enough hours to get a second associates degree  i ve never felt especially passionate about college or school in general  the only real positive i ve had with college is i met my current gf and we have been together for   years  while it has been great it has also given me another person to worry about taking care of  i feel like i can t really take care of anyone since i can t really take care of myself anymore  i have a really bad back and hip from my time in the air force and it has led me to believe i can t physically do much  i ve been stuck in a loophole with the af for over   years about my status and i haven t even begun the process with the va because my unit hardly knows i exist  i try to frequently call and email them on a bi daily basis and i either get no response or the same generic response of   we re waiting on this   with all of this in mind i feel pressured that i have to get an education to be successful  personally i don t believe a bachelors degree guarantees me success  but since i can t stand for more than    minutes and am not physically active i have no idea what to do  i help all the people i can around me when it comes to pursuing their dreams and goals and they are out achieving them  while i m very glad that they re pursuing their happiness i can t help but feel left behind  i ve gone to multiple therapists and it almost always goes the same with generic responses and the feeling of them not caring  i had a therapist for   years that helped me get through some bad issues in the past that abandoned me when i threatened suicide a couple months ago and got detained by police and taken to a mental health clinic  he had to go on vacation and he would talk to me in a couple weeks time  after that i just don t trust people anymore with my feelings besides my gf  she s currently in basic training and i don t get to talk to her besides letters  i m afraid that if i talk about how i truly feel then i will get sent back to that mental hell hole and rot away  lately i haven t done much  i take my dog out on walks and make sure he s happy  bought some groceries for a friend that i hadn t seen in a couple months  and i just laze around playing video games until   or  am  i have other friends spend time with each other without me because i probably suck being around  last time i was with them we went bar hopping and into a club  which i m terribly afraid of  had a mental breakdown and that was that  i know this post has a lot of back and forth in it  but this is how my mind is right now  the only time i feel comfort and peace of mind is when i play video games  i get to be the funny outrovert guy that i can be and have a great time with some old friends i ve been with for a long time and make new friends  i guess this is a bi product of the kid who had the silver spoon in his mouth growing up  i thought i had gotten over my laziness after completing basic training and going back to school after a break  but i ve come back full circle feeling like a complete loser  i have no idea what to do or where to even start  if i m being completely honest all i want is to have my dog  gf  video games  and time with the family  i don t care about what job i have  but at the same time i want to find a career i m passionate about and that won t hurt my back or hip anymore  i feel like i m quite literally in   different loopholes and i have no idea how to get out of any of them  i don t even know how to explain this in a coherent fashion yet here i am trying ,depression

t3_dlbiej,Khostan1,drowning,like my title says  i m drowning     i don t know what to do anymore  or how to even keep going  this last year and especially last few months  have been horrible     i really don t know why i m here anymore or why i even try to keep going  i was kicked out of home by family  because i  a white male  have fallen in love with a black girl  who is my world  and as you will see  will never be backseat to anyone or choice i make   i asked her to move in with me after we dated for a few months       and she said yes  we had been living together for almost a year when my family  gma owns the property  i own the house  pretty much forced me to move out because  instead of coming to me like adults  they went to my gma and bitched and loaned etc  until i made the choice for her  she is extremely old  had stints in her legs  takes blood thinning meds  and suffers from stress  due ofc to family  i moved to avoid causing her anymore pain and hospital visits    after we moved  she asked if she could take time for herself  to figure out what she wants to do and also figure out a few other things  i said ok because i want her to be happy and if that is what does it  then i will  i miss her and have not slept well without her since  and it s been hard  after that  i lost my job due to a conniving co worker  i really started struggling then     when i lived back home  i payed for both mine and my cousins power bills   after i moved  they broke into my house and stole a lot of very expensive computer and gaming equipment  as well as very sentimental things i had not been able to get moved yet  my gpa was the father i didn t have  and he taught me many things    he is also why i got into gaming   he brought me an nes with mario duck hunt and the zapper when i was barely able to hold a controller  took me fishing  arrow head hunting  swimming  etc  the things he left me  i cherish them  on top of that  they stole the money i had saved up and i couldn t prove any of it  i knew it was them  i yielded that because there was nothing to be done and besides my gma and mother  my family has nothing to do with me  i m not like them at all  interest and personality  i was expected to keep paying their bill     are you fucking stupid    so when i said that  they pretty much made it where i can no longer visit my gma  because after a fistfight in her yard with my cousin and uncle  they have told me that they will call the cops on me if i ever set foot there again    so now where i grew up is completely off limits as is my gma  so i m where i am now  but alone  i have asked my mother for help  but she can t really do anything as she s currently going through an issue my stepfathers old job caused with their income  something about him accidentally earning too much that last year before he retired  the woman i love though  she still sees me everyday  take her to work  bring her home  to the store  etc  despite how far i have fallen      she still wants to be around me  and tries to help me when she can    she cooks for me and buys food sometimes  gives me gas money  and spends time with me  i have found a new job but it s only     hours a week at minimum wage     what she does for me     even with everything going on with her mom and sister  lots of stress from there because her mom has had to be watched due to an accident  and her sister dumps her   kids off on them and takes off all the time  i guess i m trying to say that it brings me to tears     i want to help her and make her happy as i know she s struggling with all the stress her job and home life put on her    i honestly thought about cutting ties with her and moving w o saying anything  because i feel like i m a source of stress to her as well  i love her so much  and i had thought about proposing to her  i still do     i never have felt the amount of love and care in my life for anyone  even myself  ever     before her  i thought i d go through life alone  and i was ok with that     until i met her  suddenly   i feel things for someone else    i cared and still do  about my gma and mother  and i ve been in a few relationships in the past  but they were only a few months and it was mostly sex  eating together and just hanging out   when those relationships split and we were just friends   except one who was very bitter over a few things  it did not hang over me  like i was missing something  i didn t feel much really  i enjoyed being with them and around them  but if they weren t there  no loss  her  it s been different   before i asked her to move in  which i never did with anyone else  i started feeling     things for her  i tend to over think things and yes    i m stupid because i try to analyze love  and i have never felt the way she made and still does  make me feel  i love her  i truly do  for the first time in my life  i started thinking about what someone else wanted before i got something i wanted  i did and still do what i can for people i care about  but with her  i really care when i do those things  i think about her before myself  and if i can make her happy  there isn t a cost that is to high  she means everything to me  and as i said before  i thought about leaving for here as well  despite not really being in the best circumstance to do it     i have suffered and dealt with so much this last year  and have even had my phone cut off     yet she still wants me to take her to work  be around her  and treat me to food  and even bought me some clothes for my new job     i just don t want to be a ball and chain to her     i feel like i m hurting her just being here  and i can t stand it     we aren t together  and i don t know if we ever will get back together     but i want her to be happy  safe  successful and comfortable  i pushed her through cosmetology school and she has since gotten a job at a stylist place and she s doing amazing there   and she s happy there with the people she works with  i just feel like i m the last memory of a time maybe better forgotten     she suffers from self image problem  and thinks she s ugly     it breaks my heart to hear her say those things     i wish i could show her how amazing she looks to me  to everyone else     she is the most beautiful smart  hard working  attitude giving woman  person  i have ever met  there is no one else for me out there  no other woman even gets my attention     there has been a few times where i ve been flirted with and straight asked out  but i just couldn t do it  we aren t dating now  but it felt and thinking now  still feels like betrayal     she is the one i love  i have given my heart to  and she knows this    i just don t want her feeling like because i feel that way  she should reciprocate  there is tons of guys out there that could do more for her  give her more  take her places  etc    at this  point  i m a complete failure  and she should avoid me before being dragged down     i love her more than anything  and i want the best for her  even if it s not me     i am sorry for the length of this post  i m just all over the place with emotions     trying to keep it to together while i type this  and i guess  to ask others what they think     what should i do  i do t know anymore     i m struggling   wise and emotionally    i have no one to talk to anymore  i don t put any of this in her simply because she already deals with so much  i couldn t bear to hurt her ,depression
t3_dlbhmu,m_m_3,just gotta vent a little,so today i tried telling my friend who had depression about how i ve been feeling depressed for a while now  it s been a little over a year  i didn t really want to tell her because i didn t want to burden her and make her feel like it s her fault  idk  but she s the first person i tried opening up to because i thought that maybe she could help  i texted her and told her about how i feel empty and nothing matters anymore and i asked for some advice or help and she just left me on open   i feel like she doesn t care or she just doesn t want to deal with me and idk if i m being over dramatic i probably am and i m probably just overthinking it but now i m really regretting this  do you think i shouldn t have done this  i feel like now she has this burden over her shoulders or something idk,depression
t3_dlbhl9,Jurrisian,hopeless future as a teacher and as a student,i m going down a career path i probably won t succeed in  that is becoming a teacher   i can t really imagine myself doing anything else  at the same time i can no longer imagine myself doing it  i ve become a mostly absent minded  unmotivated person  can t really think critically  the only thing i can think about is depression  regret  and suicide  can t pay attention in class  college is killing me  all i want to do is sleep everyday away  have not been keeping in classes  i don t know how i m still going to class   speaking of college i might have fucked myself  i transferred colleges  from a known good school to another school  the justification was the commute  almost   hours each way  this school is only an hour  was the education program there good  yeah  is the education program here good  i don t know  i hear regardless all education courses are mostly useless  there was bullshit there i didn t want to deal with and now bullshit here i don t want to deal with  i felt more at home there  here everything feels foreign  i think if i stayed i wouldn t be happy  and now i m here and i m not happy  it might have been the right choice all things considered  but i simply cannot live with my decisions  doesn t help that i made that decision when i was in a terrible mindset   back to absent mindedness  some of the time when i talk i don t know what the fuck i m talking about  like words come out of my mouth and i m like wtf am i saying  i don t feel connected to what i am saying  i have trouble speaking in general  timidness and voice cracks and occasional slurring which in turn makes me more timid  i have trouble explaining things  which is not a good quality to have if you re trying to become a teacher  i cannot process things well and most of the time have nothing to say   official diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder  though i m not sure  i m now on my  th therapist and  rd psychiatrist  the new psych described my case as complex  and me as strange but not weird  funny thing  he asked me what school i go to  i told him which school i go to  he never heard of it  and i told him what school i used to go to  first thing he asked is if i regretted it  great  he wants me on lithium  lamictal isn t working  i m honestly excited for it  he says it should improve my mood and stop my suicidal thoughts  which is what i m struggling with heavily  i tried to kill myself a month ago  ended up in a psych ward  felt at home there  now out and i m miserable  i don t want to be here  i m running on fumes for college  i can t continue like this much longer  otherwise i ll fuck up this semester and my entire future  if i have a future  everything seems so pointless and hopeless  i ve spent most of my life depressed  had three breakdowns  one psychotic  within a little over a year with two suicide attempts  out of four suicide attempts total in my life  and am trying to avert another crisis  all while trying to become part of a profession that requires a lot of work  motivation  energy  stability  competency   nuance  and tact  all of which i lack  and a constant drive for self improvement  which i do not have to improve myself as a person  so how am i supposed to do that for an intensive field  that is if i can even get fucking certified in the first place   sorry for the ramblings ,depression

t3_dlba4r,FearJarl,so it was my birthday today,i ve lurked on this sub before but this would be my first post and honestly just need a place to write out what i m feeling  my birthday was today and every year on this day feels more sad than happy  and i feel like a greedy narcissistic asshole to think that i should expect for people to gift me or wish me happy birthday but today my own family forgot it was my birthday and didn t realize until i mentioned it  i don t really have any friends and this day is just a reminder day telling me i m still alone  the only thing that is keeping me from breaking down is my dog that is basically the only thing that has shown genuine affection towards me ,depression
t3_dlb90e,raventth5984,it feels like a constant  painful battle ,i feel like it is a constant battle with my mind to struggle against horribly destructive habits   they are too ingrained in me after years  and it feels like a constant battle  using new tools i have been learning from competent therapists to fight against the bad thought and feeling patterns that would suck me down into a black hole of despair  only to leave me withdrawn and paralyzed with misery and fear   it makes me feel constantly anxious  and it is exhausting and draining   it is discouraging to think that it will always feel like this  i do not always want to be fighting against my unhealthy self that has persisted for years   it terrifies me that the battle will never go away  or become more bearable  or that it will take too long of a time for things to become  easier  for me to exercise more positive self care habits   i am fighting very hard to not beat myself up here on this post   about how many years i feel like i have lost because of feeling stuck with incompetent  selfish therapists  and not realizing at the time just how bad their lazy  methods  were for me at the time   it was only shallow comforting and instant gratification that i received from that  therapy  instead of more long term  useful tools for better  positive health and self healing   this constant struggle brings me close to feelings of wanting to just give up   to just give in and consider suicidal options  that is how exhausting and frightening this process has been for me at times   but i have still been fighting against that  i feel so lost ,depression
t3_dlb8q6,BigGayvibes,feeling hopeless,i feel like there s no control i have over my life  i feel as if everything is coming down on me at once  it s hard to just keep going  and i get more and more hopeless everyday  i m young  but it feels like life is already too much for me  does anyone else relate to this ,depression
t3_dlb8n5,EchoGrae,oops triggered,the tiniest thing triggered me tonight   an old writing partner mentioned a character in a group chat that she uses with new a writing partner  she and i no longer write  after    years of doing so with this particular character having been my favorite  and i m a fucking mess  writing is my passion and writing with her meant everything  sooooo this was awful for me   i got my shit together enough to make another alcoholic drink in front of my family   i guess that means i m good   tight   ,depression
t3_dlb8c9,ThatGuyAllen,i m terrified ,i havent posted here before  but i dont know where else to go  i m alone  scared  and having really bad thoughts  all my friends are asleep  i m going to go to sleep and wake up and check this  anxiety and depression have taken over my life  and right now i m having flashbacks  i know this is kind of vague  sorry about that  im nervous and tired  but just leave some positive comments or something so that i can get out of bed tomorrow  i m gonna try to sleep  but i ll reply in the morning ,depression
t3_dlb6a6,ishovedcolaupmynose,i feel so unloved and invisible ,i know no one s gonna see this  let alone read through it  but whatever  i just want to vent for a little bit   i m so sick of appearing as non existent to everyone  people around my age are in stable relationships or are already getting married and having kids  i can t even say i have   friend  i ve no one to talk to  the only friendship i ve had in my life in middle school i recently realized to have been toxic  but at the time it was all i had  now  i have nothing  i didn t make any friends in high school  so i thought maybe i would in college  i m halfway through college and i have no friends still  i ve tried so hard over the last few years to befriend people and nothing ever came out of it  i always got ignored  in high school  i invited the entire class for my birthday and had like a huge table reserved  but only   person showed up  been celebrating alone at home since because no one ever remembers my birthday anymore or cares  i ve been so afraid of being alone for the rest of my life  but now i feel like that s coming true  i never leave the house unless i have to go to class or get something else done  every time i try to connect with someone  i just feel out of place  i keep telling myself maybe in the future at the workplace i d be able to make a friend  but at this point i know it s not gonna happen  i feel like i m not compatible with anyone  no one ever remembers me anymore and it just hurts getting ignored all the time  i ve been trying to open up to people lately but i keep getting shit on by people so i guess i m just gonna go back to being closed off and emotionless  not that it worked great last time  but i don t really have much of an option  this whole year has been a bust  i ve hardly done anything  i feel like i ve improved in a lot of aspects  but on nights like these it just comes down crashing back to me  i don t know if anything s changed for the better  but i m clearly doing something wrong when i have nobody in my life that i talk to anymore  i ve never been close to my family either  i ve always felt some kind of disconnection between us  and i don t see myself being close to them ever because they ve always shut me off whenever i d talk about something i m going through so i feel like no one really understands me anymore  many years ago i would ve wanted things like money and a big house but now i just want a single friend  it s sad when i feel like even something as small as that is not in the cards for me  everything i do to do improve  no one notices  on top of that i keep getting told i m wasting my time on useless things for hobbies i actually like and learn from  i wish i could disappear because i know no one would notice  hell  as of late  i ve hardly been able to feel anything at all myself  i m just empty inside  waiting for the next day to come  go to class and get back  repeat  i don t feel loved by anybody and everyone is just so much better than me  i honestly hope it doesn t come true  but right now i do see myself living like this for the rest of my life  alone and all that  i could kill myself right now and i know no one would even notice besides my parents just because they live with me  i see so many people and their friends showing them so much love and always being around them but that s never happened to me  i don t have anyone to lean onto and just cry  i really want to hug someone but i ve got no one  it s so sad that i had this dream of kissing this random person  but didn t feel anything  then i asked for a hug instead and it felt so amazing  i don t know when s the last time i ve hugged someone like that  even one person being nice to me can make my day  but every time i enter a new circle  i try my best to interact with people and befriend them and just end up getting ignored very quickly  the next day  everyone is already somehow magically best friends with each other and they talk about everything  and tell each other how much they love each other  meanwhile i have like   contact saved on my phone  i don t get why i would be even alive anymore  there s just no point to it  i m just skimming through life without feeling anything or being with anyone  i know no one cares about me or loves me  but i wish it were otherwise  i just want to feel loved for once  but no one even notices me or what i m going through  i want a friend i can talk to about everyday stuff  play games with  go out and have fun or just do nothing but chill  but i know it s never going to happen  as far as relationships or getting married  that has absolutely no chance of ever occurring because i m not very attractive in my opinion and i d probably get dumped quickly  i work out at home because i m anxious to go to the gym because i think everybody will stare at me for not looking as good as i probably should be looking at this age  and even when i work out a lot  my family and people at school college have kept reminding me about how much i should work out instead of not doing anything with my life and get a girlfriend  so it doesn t matter what i do or how hard i try  people will always see negative things about me  no one ever appreciates me or what i do  and even when i try to talk about things i like i always get  uh huh   and the conversation ends there  now  i understand not being interested in what i like  that s totally understandable  but what i mean is  often times people will just make me feel like i m dumb for liking something and that s it s useless  i just want to give up at this point with all the things i ve liked and done because i m just not getting anywhere  i just want to die and get this over with already  i used to be religious  but then gave up on it  but now what with having no one else to turn to  i sometimes feel like resorting to god again if it meant getting some things off my chest  but i don t know man    i m not sure if i m even worth saving at this point  i know i probably sound like an idiot  but i m just tired of dealing with depression for almost a decade now  i m just straight up worthless  i probably should ve taken one out of the many chances i ve had of killing myself in high school  but i didn t  hoping it d get better one day    except it never did  i m just so hurt and fed up with everything   anyway  sorry for rambling  at this point i don t even know what i m saying  but i m open to talk to anyone if someone s up for it  if not  whatever  all good ,depression
t3_dlb5nb,Michealbrown1984,why the fuck am i never good enough for anyone,my bosses at work don t appreciate anything i do  no matter how hard i try they talk to me like i m a dog and pretend i don t do anything   my parents think i m a failure  they treat me and talk to me completely different than my brother  they beg me to spend time with him and hangout with him because he lives by himself and doesn t have a girlfriend or many friends but don t give a shit that i m obviously in a horrible mood       my friends don t even text or call me they only hmu when they re bored and no one else is available  one of them was talking just the other day about how anyone who even thinks about suicide is a pussy   the only girl whose ever showed interest in me left me after only a month and a half    months later i still think about her all day every day and i m sure i haven t even crossed her mind in months  i can t stop missing her no matter what i do    amp  x   b   literally the only people who ever show interest in how i feel are people who don t know me outside of work and other people on this forum who have never even met me  i m sure if they knew me better they d stop liking me too ,depression

t3_dlay35,lovelikedusk,should i be worried about my thoughts ,sorry this is long   tl dr   i get overwhelmed sometimes over seemingly silly things  and internally say to myself that i want to kill myself i should just die  no depression diagnosis  is this how the path to suicide starts  should i seek a diagnosis and should i be worried    i  f  am in my mid twenties  growing up i was never talked to about depression  anxiety  or really any of my feelings  i was very moody around age    basically until now and my parents never really helped me figure out why and instead thought i was just being whiny and  too old  to act how i was  and often blamed my friends and tried to get my school to do something  i never did anything bad besides yell at my parents a lot  i did relatively ok in school  i was also bullied for a few years about my weight  skin  and kind of weird clothes  since then i ve always felt kind of socially awkward with very low self esteem and feel like i m judged everywhere i go  so basically i just grew up thinking something was just seriously wrong with me for being so mad all the time and i was the only one like that  fast forward to college and i had one year where i was not doing well at all  i talked to my parents about seeing a therapist and they really looked at me like i was insane and said  you re not going on medication  and that was that  i ended up seeking a therapist at my school and never told them    now i m a little older and understand how the world works a little better  i see my own therapist  we talk a lot about my continued low self esteem and very obvious anxiety  i always thought anxiety was something  other people had  but it s definitely what i experience and it was just never talked about  one time i did bring up depression with my therapist and she kind of brushed it off because she doesn t like it as a defining term  i really kind of want to see a psychiatrist to know if somethings wrong on a chemical level  the reasons for this post is    whenever i feel like i say something stupid or am causing issues  i really say to myself  i want to kill myself  or  i should just die  and start thinking about ways to do it  but not seriously  last night  this happened and i stared to wonder if this is how a path to suicide really starts and if i should be scared about not addressing my thoughts  i haven t told my therapist in fear of it coming off as just being dramatic  recently i found myself hitting my forehead with my hand after an embarrassing moment  and i did this for a few days  i have no other history of self harm besides binge eating   anyways  i m looking for clarity on what i m feeling  i can get up in the morning but also have daily  i want to die  thoughts   i m wondering if my confusion is due to never being able to name my feelings as a child  and always being yelled at for being upset  what is it really like when you see a psychiatrist  any insight would be helpful ,depression

t3_dlaf72,venthrowawayyy,i don t feel like i can do this anymore,     was the worst year of my life  i spent it alone with my self esteem and worth in the gutter  it was really the first time i was depressed and it was awful  looking back on my childhood  depression would explain a lot  but it went from a minor nuisance that i had never even picked up on to a life destroying monster that left me spending entire days in bed   i had friends and family but none of them have ever been close with me  yeah  i interact with them both but i ve never had a real relationship with any of them  my family generally dislikes me and friends have never really supported me in any way beyond casual appreciation  that didn t change until early       when i met somebody new   within a week we were together and every day after that was spent madly in love  it was the first time i could open up and feel safe  she struggled with everything i did  so we kept each other afloat for a while and she gave me more than a reason to live  she was perfect and my everything until a few weeks ago   she broke up with me because she felt a reltionship was stressing her out  we were still on good terms  remaining friends with plans to end up getting back together  even though i was assured that it was temporary  i sunk back into a depressed state which was now much more severe since i knew what i was missing out on   things we fine between us until we got in an argument  i was stressed and venting and upset and i guess i had been doing that too much because she turned on me real quick  calling me toxic and calling out a lot of negative things about me  we re still talking but it s clear that we ve hurt each other   i have never felt more like garbage and it hurts bad  i have hurt coming from every angle  i ve lost my friends slowly over the last few years but now  i have absolutely nobody and nothing for support  i hate that i m back to crying myself to sleep every night and being plagued with nightmares  i hate myself for screwing everything up and being a bad person   i m starting to feel numb and tired to anything and i just don t feel like i have it in me to go any further in life  i m a toxic person and knowing that stings   to anybody reading this  thanks for letting me vent  i ve run out of places to turn but i guess typing into this void helps for now  i have absolutely nothing else to rely on anymore ,depression

t3_dla93v,PJDont-Stop,the best way i can say this,you open your eyes and peer into a blank canvas  you look around you to see an ocean of colors to use to paint that canvas with  when you look at yourself you see an infant  you stick your fingers into random paint tins and get to work   amp  x   b   time goes on  you re a child now and unlike before your using a large paintbrush  the canvas is filled with color  it s vibrant and beautiful  something you would only expect from the mind of a child  you grow a little older  in your hands the typical paintbrush   unlike before your canvas is primarily one color   in a small corner of the canvas the primary colors everyone must know and need are prominent   amp  x   b   now you re older  preparing yourself to commit to your color full time   the primary colors in the corner always there  however  as you paint your color grows duller  your paint has dried out  that color no longer has any interest or meaning to you   amp  x   b   you try a couple of other colors you always acknowledged but weren t overly interested in before  those colors dry out quickly  you in desperation look to the many tins of color surrounding you  empty   as you look back to your canvas it s once again empty but this time you can t fill it  this time there are no colors  this time you don t know what to do  this time your lost  sad helpless  but the worst part  no one can tell anything is wrong when they look at you    edit  i m surprised i was able to get all this out  i m not much of a talker  or good at socializing these days,depression

t3_dla5q4,shutupmyhead,does depression hurt your intelligence ,i don t know if i ve ever been smart  i was always a good student  but i always just memorized things in order to pass tests and then tossed aside all the information forever  i never cared about learning  but now it s really starting to hurt me   i feel maybe my depression is causing me to be unable to learn things  nothing ever sticks in my head  i could not tell you who the countries were fighting in wwii yet i ve read it a dozen times  i don t know basic american history  i m american   i can t do simple math in my head  etc  every time i try to hold an intelligent conversation with other people  they end up correcting me on literally everything i say  and then i just stay quiet or leave  i get really angry when people correct me too   maybe i m just not a smart person in general  but that depresses me because my dad is pretty smart and he always tried to teach me cool stuff about science and history  and i feel horrible that none of it sticks in my brain   i feel i got broken up with because i wasn t smart enough  he was always correcting me  then it just always caused fights  i kept apologizing for not being smart but i couldn t help it   this is an endless cycle and i wish i was smarter  i wish i could have a full thought  any thoughts i have are very scattered and i can never finish a thought  i don t have adhd or any learning disability that i know of  but i m starting to question it   i hope my post makes sense  i feel like my thoughts are always scattered all over the place and confusing  does depression affect one s intelligence or ability to learn ,depression

t3_dl9y80,-Noctis-Strife-,the imposter syndrome of a mildly depressed psychologist ,it s      am and i just swallowed my first ever anti depressant  it tasted slightly sugary for a moment and then nothing  i have some interesting thoughts running through my head  though  and i thought i might benefit from documenting them   i feel like a bit of a fraud  i even had to  confess  to my gp that i don t suffer from clinical levels of depression  i m not suicidal and i m left with the feeling that i m cheating the system  he just kind of looked at me with a bit of a smile as if to say  i never said you do suffer from clinical depression   it s that old story of  you must be yea dysfunctional in order to complain about it   but i ve never felt justified in complaining  it s only in the last two years that i have sought a regular gp because i unconsciously believed i was not worth the quality level of care which comes from a person you have built rapport with  so i feel like my challenges are not  bad enough  to decide to pursue treatment   this way of thinking talks to me about arbitrary measurement standards rather than valuing what i want  when i yell at my kids  i feel guilty  when i snap at my wife  i feel ashamed  when i zone out  i feel angry at myself  these are the symptoms i would like to see improving  and it s not about whether they meet some idealistic standard of what is  bad enough   but what i would like to get out of seeing them improve  i want to be a more patient  involved  caring  energetic person  and this is a possible means to that end    i feel my mind racing to justify my decision to go on anti depressants  and i have to keep reminding myself that no justification is needed  except that it may be a valuable step in my life  it s so bizarre that i can encourage clients to take this step themselves with no judgement or convoluted decision making process  however  for myself  i need to wade through waist deep resistance to the idea which demands justification from me with every step   i m learning that thoughts  behaviour and emotion  although heavily influenced by each other  do not have to be congruent  i can think one way  feel another  and behave in another yet  and this does not demonstrate dysfunction  it demonstrates flexibility  if i went around believing that these parts of me had to be entirely congruent all the time  that would be rigid  inflexible  and add to my anxiety and depressed mood  it s okay for me to judge myself harshly  we all do  it s okay for me to feel overwhelmed  we all do  it s okay for me to behave in ways radically contrasting these thoughts and emotions   i hope you have a wonderful day ,depression

t3_dl8zpw,GrumpyRapt0r,thoughts kicked back up by an argument,i ejected myself from my friend group of   years after an argument with one member that essentially invited everyone to a party and then left me out  no one mentioned it to me and apparently there was a conversation about whether i was invited or not but no one else really fought for me despite knowing it was sort of messed up to do so  so after questions asked and various explainations essentially the  friend  having the party didn t invite me because he wanted to invite a person that caused alot of grief for me last year  essentially he s made it clear he s always going to choose this person over me no matter what  the thing is there s several accounts of the things that transpired between me and this person   but the  friend  has avoided the main issue   the fact that he didn t invite me and it felt sort of shitty to not even be told  and also an agreement between me and everyone else that s met him that on an emotional level he lacks alot of consideration for anyone elses well being  all things i ve brought up in a peaceful way initially   because his opinion of this person is so strong he s been trying to gaslight me   somehow telling me that what i feel and what i went through isn t real  despite his own friends confirming that as well as several other people around  the thing is he wouldn t ask anyone when i told him that all the proof he needs is in anyone else s account of the matter because their perception will match up with mine  making it clear that i m not the crazy one  with every mention of that he d just not address it but still persist that i connect with this other person that really put me through a situation of isolation when i was grieving and was just overall an asshole to me  this entire conflict caused me so much grief  and while i understand that no one is obligated to partake in a conflict that they don t want to  i kept telling the other friends what was going on and wrong it was  and they agreed at one point only  and stayed silent every other time  the midst of another obvious unfair treatment against me they wouldn t stand up  i was going to meet up with everyone all together at some point to hash it out again   but i decided i had explained enough already and the main person i was having the conflict with just refused to listen to me  he wrote me off as crazy despite any of my evidence  and so i decided it wasn t worth the sleep i was losing trying to come up with more evidence to disprove that  and cut him and everyone else off for just letting it happen  as much as i love them and maybe they were just afraid or soemthing  i was constantly saying that i didn t feel listened to   i was constantly making the extra mile to get them to say anything at all  i was constantly let down by them   it s funny because i kept mentioning how we literally all agreed that coming to him with anything personal is a bad idea because anything he says just makes us feel worse or the situation feel worse and maybe he should have a bit of introspection about that  and that s exactly what he ended up doing because i felt so fucking gaslighted that i ve been questioning myself and contemplating just ending it cause i see a pattern of situations in my life like this one  and my bf and alot of other people around me tell me i m sane  but considering it was a pretty important friendship to me and no one really ever answered when i called for help  i can t help but wonder if i really am  or contemplate not living lmao  considering this is one of many shitty friendships i ve had in my life where i ve obviously been fucked over  and when i defend myself and others people either go against me or dont listen  i m just sort of tired of never being heard  never having friends that are really there for me  you know ,depression

t3_dl8qyf,UsuallyAlone,i keep getting trapped between depression  social anxiety and existential anxiety   ,   but i don t think i ve given up hope completely   i feel like a total asshole for being depressed a lot  my life is wasted on me  i have a whole bunch of minor health issues that i obsess about  but nothing debilitating  i m not very happy with my looks but i m told i m handsome  and i m quite tall  which means that in return for back knee pain i get taken more seriously  i have really bad adhd but i m good enough at my job to make a decent living  and i live in a country that is currently doing quite well   someone could probably take all that and be a happy  successful person with a meaningful life  somehow that s not me  i spend my nights and weekends at home playing videogames while watching tv  i m introverted and socially awkward  so i find it difficult to meet new people   usually i don t even know where to begin  i ve stopped doing online dating because it either makes my depression worse  or i get on an emotional rollercoaster that quickly derails and then i take a bunch of innocent women with me down the abyss  it s like treating a migraine with heroin   for years i was avoiding exercise because i thought it was making me sick   now that my depression is getting worse again and i m old enough for a mid life crisis  there has been an interesting development though  some of my anxieties are getting overpowered by a sense of desperation  if i get sick from exercise  then what  i m currently getting sick because of lack of exercise  and some socially awkward situations might actually distract me from being depressed  plus  the times in my life when i ve been stressed also happened to be the ones when i felt most alive   i ve always thought that before my depression becomes terminal  i ll first try all the things i ve been too scared to try  after all  what do i have to lose  i realize that this only works during the  desperate  phases of a depression  and not necessarily during the  unmotivated  ones  so i better make any tiny bit of motivation count   the thing that has worked kinda well recently  hiking  it started out with me getting drunk  which i rarely do  and going out into the woods at night  in total darkness  after a couple of times i decided to go hiking  i even brought some alcohol in case i got too miserable  but i didn t even need it  then i ve done it two more times  and there s really something about being out in nature that i ve underestimated ,depression

t3_dl8qjw,sucks_to_be_a_duck,     just getting by   scared i ve missed my chance,this is long but i ve got to get this off my chest    here it goes      i was leading an exciting  successful life up till the age of about     i m    now and really scared for my future  i feel like i ve missed my chance to live my full potential  each day i loose a little more faith that i m capable of doing anything anymore  i think i need to give up my dreams  it s like that poem about two paths  where the author takes the one less trodden  well i did the same  and now i m totally fucking lost  with nobody about to ask directions  and even if i did get back to that fork  it would just mean taking the path i had no interest in in the first place  it would be like accepting an early death  the things that made me love life are fading  and i am very scared that in a few years  i ll have nothing but memories   some context   i have been obsessed with storytelling all my life  i ve been working hard to make a career out of it  as a filmmaker  photographer  writer   in my early   s i felt ahead of the curve  living the dream  i saw great things ahead of me  when i was in my early   s i started a community of creatives  and from that a huge number of opportunities opened up for me  i took those opportunities   seeing things and doing things that would sound unbelievable if i shared them all here  i also met a girl and together we chased the sun and the next wild adventure  i went about collecting experiences   around    i sunk my soul into a project that eventually i finished   years later  i was proud and hopeful  but the world didn t receive my film the way i hoped and i felt totally defeated  around the same time i got a job at small company  it was miserable and i was taken advantage of  and that crushed my spirit even further  and then myself and my partner broke up  it was sad but necessary   paradoxically  a loving decision for us both   from then till now  i still had a few adventures  one satisfying project has kept me going in the last few months  but something in me broke  i can no longer write  i can no longer find the will to create  i am self employed but slowly losing any passion in what i am doing  i have stopped believing in myself  i started taking more and more drugs  weeks and months and years are slipping by  i watched many of my friends find  sensible  paths  get married or find their way somehow  i am increasingly lost  increasingly alone  my mind is suffering from abuse of cannabis  my joy of living has festered into bastardised solitude  i have slipped into deep depression   today i don t know if i have the will to go on  i know i must change something  perhaps it is to accept that my dream of telling stories for a living will never come to be  perhaps i need to find a sensible job  and be content with whatever place the world has for me  it feels so wrong and so necessary to admit that i might have failed  i might have to give up  that maybe all those people who doubted me when i was younger and full of fire  were right  that the wild drive i had years ago was just a thing of youth    i have no mentors  my friends are scattered  i work alone for the most part  i think about suicide more often than i care to admit  i cannot write  i do not take photos  i only make advertising videos  the last few years i ve picked myself up from failure so many times  and i don t know how many more set backs i can take  time is falling away from me and yet i am still here  in this cold  quiet room  where the last years have escaped me  i can t seem to get a job  even as a trainee  in the field i truly want to work  i ve set so many plates spinning it is hard to keep track of them all  and they are falling  my hard fought  small business  is suffering from my own indifference  i do not believe in myself anymore  i am in a relationship i feel is doomed to fail  and feel guilty for thinking that   i cannot organise myself  i cannot motivate myself  i cannot wake up in the morning and i cannot sleep at night  i feel like nobody understands me  i feel like friends and family are waiting for me to give up on my crazy dreams and rejoin society as a normal human being    but i am not normal  everything good in my life has come from embracing my will to be and do different  to give up now would mean starting again  somewhere at the bottom  in a world that is now totally alien to me  the pressure of my ruthless independence has become a prison   i ve quit weed  for the second time this year   i m forcing myself away from the dark hole of internet browsing where i lost myself in recent years   i even wrote a few pages today  but i m not sure for what  self employment means i can t stop  or rest  or take stock  without my business failing  i ve looked for jobs and i m willing to take the cut in freedom and pay  to not be so damn alone for a little while  and to be around people who inspire me  but so far i can t get those jobs  i m starting to think i m unlikable to potential employers  i hate advertising yet it s all i do  i want to tell stories that mean something beyond a product   disaster is looming  the little i have today  i could loose  if i don t get my life together  i don t know where to start  or how   thats my story  i don t know if anyone can help  but i just want to put it out there  thanks for reading ,depression

t3_dl8a5a,Cheslovas,sleep and depression intertwined in a bad way ,i used to hate going to sleep  maybe because i am not really a good sleeper  i wake up during the night about     times  sometimes even out of fear  don t know why  maybe because i am so dissapointed in myself  i keep procrastinating everything  even the littlest of things  this wasn t such a big problem during my school years probably because it wasn t really that bad  now that i started studying in a university i feel completely obliterated  i now skip gym for no reason whatsoever  do my homework late up all night and don t eat as much as i should  sleep has become for me a literal escape from my delusional reality    everyday all i am most excited about is just going to sleep  when i lie down i can forget about everything and just feel complete emptyness and quietness  i feel free but at the same time shackled by the accumulating feeling of regret and pity  i hate myself so much i can t even describe the feeling in words  i used to be so on point in everything  i am a schedule person and i like everything to be in order and perfect    but now it s just all over the place  i feel like i don t even know what the hell am i doing in my life   i can t do my homework or learn a new subject like before  all i do is wait and wait until the critical hour comes by  when there s about   hours left of sleep i finally start doing something  my procrastination is unreal   maybe i am overthinking about all of this  it s just really getting in my way of enjoying life  sleeping helps me reset for each and every new day that comes  and at the end of the day i break down  the cycle repeats   maybe it has to do with my autism  it s a level   severity  then as well i have tourette syndrome  honestly i don t know    it s just that i can t focus anymore or stop my procrastination  i feel like i had to let my feelings out somewhere  sorry if this is the wrong place ,depression
t3_dl89x5,Woogles94,everytime i think i have a friend they end up basically ghosting me ,i have been back and forth with my depression for a really long time      years  everytime i ve felt like i had a good relationship with someone and started to talk about myself  not even my depression just anything  i am ignored  i get that know one likes to listen to constant whining  and i really make a big effort to not talk negatively often    the last couple months have been especially hard  and i have had almost no one to talk to and unfortunately i cannot afford therapy  i had a friend at work that i would talk to sometimes about relationship stuff and just general life problems  but last week that person just suddenly decided they no longer wanted to talk to me and has been ignoring and avoiding me  this happened so often when i was younger that all i can think is i must be the worst most annoying person to meet because it seems like after a few months of friendship everyone decides they don t want to do it anymore    i know that i need to just stay to myself and stop trying to talk to people but it is hard  i hate myself but that does not stop me from getting lonely or those random times where i want to be sociable  honestly it s like i hate my life and i go back and forth all the time thinking i want to make all these changes and get out of this hole i ve built  and then i ll think there s no point and it would be easier to just not wake up     i m not sure where this post is going  i m just feeling really alone and depressed and wasn t sure where else to put my thoughts  thanks for listening reddit ,depression
t3_dl88nq,bja98,the same thing happens to me all the time and i m sick and tired of it,i ve never been a social guy  i m quite shy and never had lots of friends  i m really bad at talking to people and opening up to them  i tell you this because it s really important to understand the situation    so back in      i had a crush on a girl  we were close friends  but i started to feel more  i told her  and she rejected me obviously  it really hurt me but we still tried to be friends  it didn t work out well  we stopped talking and caring about each other  i was very depressed because as i told you  it s really hard for me to let people close to me  so obviously losing her was a big trauma  it took me about     years to fully accept that we are not friends anymore   but something started again  i started to talk more and more to a girl  we became friends  and then later  best friends  we knew ecerything about each other and we talked every day  literally every day  it didn t took me long to fall in love  since he had a boyfriend at that time i kept my feelings to myself  i didn t want to stand between them  all i wanted is her to be happy  and not to mention i didn t want this friendship to result in the same thing as before  it was hard  but i kept it in  fast forward to february       and she somehow found out that i had feelings for her  she stopped talking to me  one day everything was fine  and the next day she acted like we never knew each other  she didn t even tell me what was going on  but deep down i knew that somehow she found out my secret  i was shocked that i lost another loved one  another friend  i cant tell you how much i ve cried  how much i thought about ending my life because i only saw darkness everywhere and i wanted it to end  because the one person that i loved from the bottom of my heart  left me  some people say that it s even harder to lose a really close friend than a girlfriend boyfriend  but with a help of a an old friend of mine  after almost   years i managed to climb out of this  and i felt good  it was hard  really hard  but i was happy again somehow    fast foward to       i can t believe it  but the same thing seems to be happening again  for the  rd time  there is this girl that i got to know over the internet  we started talking  i m not saying we are close friends  but we talk regularly and i really enjoy her company  after a long time  i met someone that i could possibly open up to  as i said  it s really hard for me  so if i get close to someone it show that the person is really  really important to me and i trust him her  a couple days ago we were chatting about random stuff  but suddenly she stopped responding to me  i tried to ask her what s up but she didn t answer   since then  she doesn t like my pictures  i know it sounds kinda stupid  but she was almost always the first one to put a heart on my posts on fb and instagram   i don t know what to do now  i don t know what i did wrong  but i m just so afraid of losing her that i already cried myself to sleep last night  i don t want it to happen to me again  because this time  i m not sure i ll ever get up    honestly  i m at a point where i just want to go away to a deserted island and live the rest of my life there  without people  just me   thank you for reading it  it really means a lot  i had to write this down because i don t really have anyone to talk to  ,depression

t3_dl7ro6,whycantifindaname123,i think i m just a coward,i feel like i have no control over what happens in my life and i m too scared to try and fight it    backstory  i have been fighting depression for about    years now  it s been a rough fight  i had a few suicide attempts a couple of years ago after some bad shit happened  about a year and a half ago my gf got pregnant with my son  i was scared and acted like an asshole but after i came to terms with being a dad in my early   s she forgave me  i was there for his birth and for the first    months if his life  my son is amazing  the best thing in my life by far  he s the sweetest  happiest little guy ever  this is where things start to go back downhill   about two months ago my gf decided she was moving back to her home state where my son was born  she moved to my state after he was born for a few months and had been living with me for a year before getting pregnant   she moved because she couldn t get work in my state with her degree and thought she could in her state  i ve gone and visited them twice so far but after coming back this time i ve been massively depressed that i can t be with my son    now it would be an extremely easy choice for me to drop everything here and move to be with them  but i am still in school and very dependent on my mom as she pays for my school and let s me stay with her since my school is close to her house  i have tried talking to both of them about the situation and how i feel but when i talk to my mom about me moving to be with them she gets very angry and says she will stop paying for my school  when i talk to my gf about coming back she says she doesn t want to be in a state where she can t find a job she likes    i feel like a damn coward all the time  i m too scared to drop out and move to be with my son because i feel i would be stuck in my low paying retail job forever but being away from him is killing me  i haven t been suicidal in years and i know i would never go through with it now that i have my son  i grew up with no dad and i could never do that to him  but every day i wake up and don t want to be awake  i can barely get out of bed  i m always angry and sad and terrified of these thoughts that i have    i ve tried getting appointments with psychiatrists but none of them return my calls and it just makes me feel worse  i don t know what to do anymore   thank you for listening to this  i hope your day is going better than mine ,depression

t3_dl7kvy,nourm124,my boyfriend broke up with me,it s been like a month or so since we last talked  when i first met him online he was so insecure about himself and kept telling me how he doesn t like to open up to people because he thinks that they may think that he s weird and because hate seeing people like that because i myself am so insecure  so i d try comforting him and what so ever and hopefully he got some confidence in himself and i was so happy he did because finally my existence is useful to someone on this earth  however  days went by and things are normal till one day i had a problem with my phone so i couldn t talk to him i kept sending him emails to describe the situation to him but he never replied and i was so miserable because i thought when i d be gone for a   weeks or so  he d at least try making at least the slightest bit of effort to contact me but  nothing  finally  when i had my phone back and i tried texting him again and was so angry because he didn t even try to reach me at all  he just replied saying  sorry i was so busy with my studies   i get that but the fact that he wouldn t take only   minutes from his day to text me  was so sad  however  we kept arguing till one i had a break i had a breakdown  one of those days where the bed was like a magnet and all i could do was cry  and since i couldn t talk to anyone about it i just started opening up to him and i though at least he d support me  but he didn t he kept telling me that i was overreacting and that i m wasting his time complaining about stupid stuff  and that just broke my heart to the point where i d just cry for a very long time and think that everything about me  is worthless and maybe it actually is   one day when i decided that i ve had enough i just asked him right away if he still loves me and he just said no  he said he didn t  and that just broke me    he broke up with me after i d lifted him up  and made fun of my sadness when i just needed some support  he just broke my soul and maybe telling this story wouldn t just take the pain away because that s not how the world works but i just needed to get this off my chest  i know my story might sound stupid  but   i don t really know anymore what s real or not ,depression

t3_dkqy22,TehTexasRanger,how to stop comparing myself to others ,i m    and i ve had major depression and anxiety for most of my life but now it s at an all time high  even with a college degree i hate my life more than ever and feel like a complete failure  everyday i see people who are my age and they re doing way better than me financially which means they are better than me as a person and i can t take it  i see them going to exclusive events  having acting careers  seeing them on media outlets  keep in mind  these aren t celebrities but people i know irl    then i imagine people who have made it when they were my age like mark zuckerberg and basically every athlete ever  i m over hear doing absolutely nothing with my life making   k a year at best     k at worst  i feel like a failure as a human being and like i deserve to be treated as such so i don t mind being treated like crap because i feel like i deserve to be treated this way for being a failure    it s hard for me to do anything anymore without constantly comparing them to myself  it s hard for me to enjoy anything when all i see is a bunch of people doing what i couldn t even dream of doing living their dream while i am stuck on the sidelines  i ve been to therapy and been on a few pills at this point  but it hasn t helped and now i m at the point where i barely have energy to do anything  what should i do   tl dr     year old with major depression can t stop comparing himself to successful people around his age or people who were successful by age  therefore feels like less of a human being and should be treated as such ,depression

t3_dl67gp,anonymous876543,how can i not give up  after these last few years ,these last few years have been so bad that i actually laugh to myself whenever something bad happens now  i got a letter today and thought to myself   this can t be good   and low and behold it wasn t  i actually laughed to myself like a weirdo after opening it  i just don t understand how anyone can tell me to keep going  or be patient  its infuriating  i know of course that people have it worse  then i feel even worse about myself for being so depressed  this is some of the stuff i ve had to deal with in the last few years  i ll keep things as short as possible   possibly abused  basically my partner has suffered with depression  social anxiety  ptsd  past physical abuse  suicide attempts and self harming  we met at uni and i isolated myself from friends and family to keep her happy  and threw myself into my degree in a stupid attempt to make it worthwhile  she made me feel guilty for having friends  guilt tripped me into doing countless things i didn t want to do  looked at my phone without permission  interrogated me about girls i knew  and much more i wont bother listing  i never really thought about it as being abusive until i recently had some therapy and my therapist said it sounded like emotional abuse  we finally break up  but a week later  whilst still living together  a family member of her s commits suicide  she leans on me like we are still together  and tells me things like  i know i m not suppose to say this  but i still love you   whilst i m down with her and her family for support  this week she admitted to feeling suicidal and having strong urges to self harm  whilst making me promise not to tell anyone else  she also told me she self harmed when i went away for a few weeks for a family holiday  i told her she might feel better phoning samaritans or something and she told me she didn t need to because she was talking to me  she is due to restart some therapy  but refuses to go home and get it back down near her family  because she doesn t want to change therapist  they have offered her therapy here straight away with a different therapist but she wont take it either  i go from thinking it was abuse to thinking i m a piece of shit for thinking it was  it s real confusing   job career is a embarrassing  as mentioned before i used my possible abuse as a means to motivate myself to do well at uni  i remember thinking to myself  all this misery will at least be worth it  in some way  oh how naive and stupid  i did well  and was able to get a full time graduate job before i even graduated  the pay was pretty crap for a role wanting a graduate            and it was really boring  but i was happy to just have a grad job tbh  fast forward     months and i have nothing to do at work  i worked through the organisations backlog of clients enquires and they struggled to give me stuff to do  at the beginning i would ask for extra tasks  but i would just be told to make massive spreadsheets with useless data that would never be touched again or followed up with  so i did my expected tasks which took at most an hour a day and applied for other jobs while at work  after working there for a year  they tell me that they will have to put me down to three days a week due to a lack of funding  it s a charity so it sounds plausible and sadly expected  however when they just recently brought a new piece of film equipment for hundreds of thousands of pounds  and i helped bring in new clients for more than my yearly salary  it felt like a slap in the face  i get nowhere after hundreds of job applications  even after seeking professional help with my cv  i was told by the university career service i should be getting interviews for the jobs i m applying for with my cv  they said they had nothing to recommend i do  frustrated i stupidly decided to do a masters thinking it would help me stand out more  but after two months i realise it is not for me  i m jaded as fuck about the value of a degree and the quality of the course seemed suspect to me  i decided to quit straight away so i wouldn t have to pay any money  and phone my parents to let them know  big mistake  we argue and when my mum asks what i m going to do if i quit  i tell her  get a job obviously   the silence after was deafening  i argue back for maybe the first time in my life and end up hanging up the phone  fast forward maybe    hours and my dad is in hospital due to his heart  i blame myself and i kind of shut down for   months  i dont quit uni  but i dont attend or do assignments and i struggle to get out of bed  looking back i think this was what finally broke me  years of feeling like want i want will hurt people because of my partner  and now there was my dad on a hospital bed  because i tried to put myself first  as solid evidence  after seven months of this i pick myself up somewhat  and manage to get a shitty job in retail i could have done whilst at school  i did get an interview for a job in london  but guess what  it just so happened to coincide with a family holiday in australia we had been talking about for decades  i said i was happy to do the interview over skype even if it was   am in aussie  but they said no  the best part in all of this was when i asked for some feedback on why i got through to the interview stage  their response read   you met the criteria for the job posting and was therefore offered an interview  wow  so helpful   possible childhood trauma  my therapist also made me reconsider my childhood  my mum has bipolar and i never really thought about how it affected me until now  it s probably why i was too forgiving with my partner   its not her fault it s her mental health   my upbringing might also explain why i struggle putting myself first  and believe i m not worth anything  growing up i felt like everyone else was more important than me  my mum obviously had her manic ups and downs  and was admitted to physic wards multiple times  my dad on the other hand had a stressful job and has always been overweight and even from a young age i worried about his health  my sister on the other hand would actually fight to have herself heard and argue back  unfortunately i just saw this as adding more stress to my mum and dad  as a result  i would just sit there and agree to do whatever in order to keep the peace  as everyone else argued  there s also other little things that other people have said was bad  i broke my arm whilst at school and my mum didn t take me to hospital until three days later  then there was the time i cut my leg with glass  and my mum again didn t take me to the hospital  my dad noticed the cut a few weeks later and took me to the hospital  but it was too late to get stitches  to be fair i got a badass scar out of it   i never thought about how seeing my mum in multiple manic states affected me  but it s hard to ignore the fact it probably did  for example seeing her pace up and down muttering to herself probably didn t do my young mind any good  might also explain why i ve always leaned towards the anxious side of the spectrum   smaller stuff     my very first car broke after   weeks of purchase  dealer refused to repair or refund purchase  took them to small claims court and spend an extra      which would be refunded if they were forced to pay  court rules in my favor  they still don t pay and when the bailiffs go round to collect  they are in liquidation  i get none of my money back and the small legal fees i paid aren t refundable and were for nothing   further evidence that hard work and life is bullshit      my best friend of over    yrs stabs me in the back  i open up to my friends about my depression and possible abuse by my partner on my birthday  christmas eve   he decides to tell his fiance  who then tells my partner  cue further guilt and feeling of being a piece of shit  i called him up on it and he says what i said wasnt very nice  so i end up apologising to him and his fiance  like the doormat i am  then when i talked to him about it again recently he was way more understanding and said he saw it now  i told him i forgave him  but honestly i haven t and i m not sure i will or even should   how the fuck am i not expected to give up  most of this stuff is just in the last   years ,depression

t3_dl6nwv,throwaway8299,does situational depression get better ,i have been feeling symptoms of depression for the past     months  boredom  lack of activity  sadness  weight gain  etc  etc  i can attribute everything back to getting diagnosed with a major  lifelong illness about   months ago  i knew the diagnosis was coming so it wasn t really a huge surprise  but the permanency of it left me on the couch crying for a good week or two  i am in medical school  so i have a pretty intense workload and lately i have been quitting a lot of my activities and i am very apathetic about studying  which usually doesn t bother me at all  i have also gained about    lbs over the last few months  which just makes me even more sad    i guess my question is  does situational depression like mine go away on its own  i feel happy when i am with other people or the few times that i force myself to get really involved with an activity  but most of the time i am not in the mood  being in med school and already having chronic medical issues which require me to miss class means i don t have a lot of time for therapy or anything like that  as much as i would like to try it   any advice ,depression

t3_dl6gsu,RayDelMar_0,just found out it s  normal  for parents to really listen to their kids,i realized my mom never listened to me no matter the problem  it made me question whether or not she actually loves me  i ve always assumed she didn t as much as her real son because she treats him so different from me  i could panic over something  needing help or comfort and she d just shrug it off or tell me i needed to  get out more   that was her answer for everything    every problem i faced and came to her with  i eventually kept my mouth shut and when my problems became more significant  suicidal  cutting  dieting  body issues etc  i didn t say a word because i didn t want to get shut down by her  but when her son came to her with anything  she would give him her utmost attention and support through it  trying to help however she could  she would give him the shirt off her back if he needed it  only recently did i discover that parents were supposed to listen to their kids after coming across something on facebook that opened my eyes  i thought it looked silly  saying something like  tune in to your children when they need to talk  or something  but when i saw how many parents responded i found not one person opposed it the way i did  it made me kind of sad not going to lie  i wish i could ve talked to my mom without worrying about being judged by her  it seems impossible to me that any parent could be compassionate and actually want to talk to their kids  i feel terrible,depression

t3_dl6cfj,theamazingsteve1,am i the only one who only exists in their mistakes ,my entire life i spend living in my past  mistakes i made  people i lost  and the utter loneliness and sadness that all of it has brought me   look at me    years ago i had a good job  an incredible girlfriend who loved me no matter what  a healthy and happy home life where i lived with both of my parents despite their being divorced  i maintained happy relationships with the people around me and i was loving life  my girlfriend and i fit together like peas in a pod  we loved each other more than anything  shit  we thought we were going to get fucking married  we were inseparable  and both friends our age and older adults alike agreed we made an excellent couple and a fantastic team  with maturity beyond our years  it was all good  the talks we used to have  being around each other  going to events together  the sex  i loved and cherished every single moment with her and she with me  we never disagreed  not because we are so similar that we couldn t  but because we would talk about what we were disagreeing on and work it out until we didn t disagree anymore  we never yelled  we never got angry at each other  it was stereotypical perfect love   things began to change  my girlfriend s dad s excessive drinking was having a real impact on her happiness  and thus  mine  i was bad at talking about my feelings  so i didn t have the words to tell her what was wrong  i thought that the thing making her sad was me  and so i tried to save her by breaking up with her  less than a month after crushing her heart  i realized my mistake and begged to get back together and let me try to undo what wrong i had done  she considered it  but ultimately it was too late  and she had already moved on    cut to now  two years later  i ve moved out of my parent s house  ruining my relationship with my father in the process  my ex girlfriend is still with the same guy that she ended up with after i left her  they ve been together longer now than we were  it feels so stupid that i still miss her  considering our relationship was relatively short in the scheme of things  but god damn  i still miss her  and i still haven t forgiven myself for leaving her two years ago  i think about my mistake every day  i ve been depressed ever since our relationship ended  and for over a year i quietly sobbed to myself every night  two separate times  i put a gun to my head and began to squeeze the trigger  for almost a year  i had what you might call ptsd  i couldn t close my eyes without seeing her in my rear view mirror  standing in the street  head in her hands while she fucking sobbed her eyes out after i broke her heart  i looked back at that and i fucking drove away  i fucking drove away  when i could ve gotten back out  hugged her  and just fucking opened my mouth and talked to the person i loved more than anything about what was wrong  i ve never forgiven myself for that   now  i ve replaced the crying with alcohol  i come home and start pouring whiskey most nights  more than most people my age  i m not an alcoholic  by any means  i don t feel the need to do it  or even the compelling urge  i just hate the fact that i come home each night to an empty apartment with no pets  darn lease won t let me have them   no friends  no girlfriend or companion  just darkness and the quiet click of my grandfather clock  and so i sit down  and i turn on a light  and i try to watch tv and find the will to eat  and when i finally find it inside me to get up and walk over to the refrigerator  i walk back with a can of reheated shit and a large glass of whiskey  and i just sit there and drink and eat and try not to think about how easy it would be to kill myself anytime i fucking wanted to  the whiskey helps to numb the overwhelming pain    life story  my point is  my past is all i think about  i was happy  once  and i can t help but think about that every moment of my waking life  i can t stop thinking about my mistakes  i can t stop missing this person that i m still in love with  but i also can t right the wrongs that got me here  i can t try again with this wonderful person  the likes of whom i have never found and might never find again  i haven t had another relationship since  apart from a near meaningless one week fling with someone i knew from high school   i know nobody will probably read this  but i have to know  am i the only one  or are there others out there who can t escape their past ,depression

t3_dl5xej,EvenPrimary650,me and myself,hi    so i m just posting here because im feeling down  i don t have anywhere to escape to and i just want to put my thoughts down here  i hate school  i know  every student does in some way or another  but i really do  the only class i love is art  where i get to do glassblowing  but i don t even get to do it that often  only     days a week for like an hour  i really enjoy that  i  on the other hand  pretty much hate all my classes and feel like i want to drop out  i hate home because i fight with my dad now almost always and my mom keeps trying to see what i m doing and being nosy  i hate my brother because he always finds a way to hurt me emotionally and makes fun of me and what i m wearing       i don t have any people i hangout with  even though i m a super nice and empathetic guy and no one really talks to me inside school  i usually spend lunches hanging alone  and or glassblowing  i don t really have anything to look forward to since my girlfriend is in another city and has very protective parents  i can t go over to her house at all and even see her during the week    a little backstory for you all that need it   i became depressed in the middle of  th grade and got addicted to painkillers  this continued up till  th grade to where i did give up painkillers  but started cutting more and more  i kept it all inside because i was afraid that i was gonna be sent somewhere for kids like me      months into  th grade i snapped  i tried killing myself but couldn t bring myself to do it  i then turned to my mom  the only person i felt that i could turn to and talked to here for about   hours straight  which really helped  i was then taken to a hospital and put on a    hour hold where i thought about how i had been feeling  while being with other kids in the hospital who were going though what i was going though   i was diagnosed with clinical depression  i then got out and was put on antidepressants  i then went though the rest of the year finding the right dosage for me  i then dealt with some other tings and went to private school for   th grade  which was fine and i felt great throughout the year  and even got off my anti depressants  i m not in   th grade and i suspect my depression is coming back   okay  now back to what i was saying   yeah  so i cant see my girlfriend during the week  it really sucks since i love her dearly  but i don t want to talk to here about all of this because she would probably be scared away  i just don t really have a lot of options when it comes to life right now  if anyone has any advice or just want to say something nice  please do   thanks   evenprimary   ,depression

t3_dl5qom,Twigggins,why do i even bother ,i don t even know where to begin  i m    m  i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxeity disorder when i was    years old  but i obviously have been dealing with it since i was a pre teen in middle school  but my family is sorta traditional and mostly uneducated  so they just thought i was just emotional boy  i was also diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder when i was   years old    i believe a lot of my problems stem from the lack of a stable father figure and a very overbearing and very religious mother who would hit me with all sorts of things when she was mildly upset with me  i was always the new kid because of how often mom would move  i ve always been the bottom of the proverbial totem pole  i ve always liked girls so i would try to ask girls out in middleschool and highschool but i ve always been rejected    i d like to believe that i m not all that ugly  i m at least a       i m      i m tan  i ve been told i have very proportionate facial features  and i m in pretty decent shape  i d like to think that i m kind  honest  patient and compassionate with others  i d like to think that i m at least a little more intelligent than average  i read quite a lot  and i love history  science  philosophy and music  i can also sing and play lots of instruments  however  dealing with rejection has played a central part in a lot of my emotional turmoil  i was in a few relationships in the past   years  but they usually all end the same way  they tell me it s not my fault and just ghost me forever  i don t get it    my father isn t all that great either  i went many years as a child without seeing him  and any time he contacts me it s for me to do a favor for him  i told him i wanted to see my grandfather in brazil who was very sick and was going to die  but he went without me and i only found out that my grandpa died a few weeks after from facebook    i ve been on and off allllll sorts of different medications  some didn t even work  some worked a little too well and i would lose       lbs within a couple months    i m currently on    mg of wellbutrin  i smoke a lot of thc now  they don t help  but i feel nothing for several hours  so i guess that works   i ve attempted suicide twice  one time by hanging when i was     in which the hook i was hanging from in fact broke off from my weight and i fell and i didn t bother to try again and threw away the rope  the other time was by asphyxiation by co in my garage roughly two months ago  where my current step father tore me out of the car when he woke up to get a snack  almost as if god would like to keep me alive just to endure the pain for as long as i can until i drive myself into insanity    i ve grown increasingly cynical and pessimistic with each misfortune that comes upon me  in the same year  this one  i ve lost my car  my job  my financial aid for school  and my relationship  i got a new crummy car just to get me around now  which is a step up from vegetating in my room all day  the more my mental health deteriorates  the faster the things around me collapse  i usually just stay inside because at least not as many things can hurt me   i was alone for four months and i fell for a girl about a month ago that i had been talking to  she s perfect  but i told her my feelings and she doesn t feel the same  the sting is heavy  and i feel all alone  i m scared to attempt suicide now because i m afraid to fail and mortally injure myself and i ll either become paralyzed or die very painfully  which i would rather avoid  my track record for bad luck is pretty extensive   the worst part is  my life is just good enough where i can t complain to anyone except for faceless readers on reddit who don t read anything except for the tl dr anyway  therapy hasn t worked  medicine doesn t work  exercise doesn t work  religion doesn t work  long walks in nature doesn t work  i have a raincloud that follows me all the time and it worries my family and the people around me  at this point  i don t care who cries over my death  everyone just wants to hurt me anyways   why do i even bother   tl dr  my life is fine  which is my main gripe  i tried  i really have  but any of my attempts at happiness in myself is always crushed by people mistreating me  i know i m supposed to find love in myself  but man  i m really fucking lonely  i relate to charlie brown a lot in this regard  good grief ,depression
t3_dl5qcn,ProbablyAgnes,i am tired of my life  the situation i am in  and not getting taken seriously, almost half a year ago i lost my driver s license because of a car accident that happened in february  already before losing my license i was on the verge of depression  but that pushed me over the edge  because of my inability to transport myself my education has been put on hold  now my boss i guess you could call him  the guy that is responsible for me as a student  is putting a lot of pressure on me to take a new driver s test so i can get a new license  it is in both of our interests for me to get a new license so i can finish my education  i have spend the last   months calling the police and other authorities having to do with this license to speed up the process and i feel like i have done all i can do  still my boss blames me for making this take so long  when i try explaining my situation he doesn t really listen      i often try talking to friends and family about my situation and i feel like i never get taken seriously  they all just write i of as teenage problems  or they tell me that i could be worse  as you can imagine all of this does not exactly help my mental state    sorry for rambling  i needed a place to vent and i had nowhere else to go,depression
t3_dl5q3d,Optimus_Pitts,the worst part of my depression has officially made it s yearly visit  possible triggers ,despite how unwelcome it is  i m    now and i ve struggled with depression and anxiety since i was about     never fails  once it starts to turn to fall  i hit a bottom  the downside is that in my state  we bounce back and forth from summer to fall for about     months   i ll say this  since i met my wife  my history of self mutilation and suicidal thoughts have significantly decreased  i ve learned to convince myself that i don t hate my life and i don t want to die  i just hate how i feel  that said  having to remind myself that multiple times a day has gotten extremely exhausting   just like every year  i m back to having the negative self talk in my head  dissociating a lot  random outbursts when i m frustrated at myself for not being able to do something and random breakdowns where i cry until i feel numb  food doesn t have a taste  music is just sound  shows on tv are just meaningless pictures  and i m isolating myself because faking the smile and pretending everything is cool takes too much out of me    between always being tired and malnourishment it s affecting my job  my stats have dropped significantly and when my manager has a coaching session with me  it ends with me beating myself up for not being better and crying for       minutes   i guess i m just venting here  if this isn t a good place to do it  please tell me and i ll delete my post   but above everything  i just want to feel like me again  i want life to feel like there s a purpose again  i m not going to do anything to harm myself  but i just don t know how much longer i can handle feeling this way,depression

t3_dl5omy,clocktickkie,help on remembering things  find myself completely lost at work on things i was just explained,about   months ago  i was diagnosed with recurring mdd  major depressive disorder   though i was struggling with depression and anxiety for about   years prior    i got a new job and moved to a new city  i love the work at this place  and its given me a better picture of what i want to do  however  i feel my depression numbs excitement  while anxiety makes me paranoid that i m constantly messing up    my main issue right now  at least the one that effects my day to day is trouble remembering things  i work a deadline heavy job  and im constantly having to ask my boss to re explain things that were discussed the day before  everything seems straightforward  but then when i sit down  my mind is wiped clean    its very frustrating  and makes me feel worse  i want to perform well and stay in this city  but im worried that i m seen as a dummy because i don t get instructions    has anyone else dealt with this ,depression
t3_dl5o0l,Halio344,do you ever feel indifferent to living ,i m a soon to be    year old male  i ve been together with my current girlfriend a little over   years  i have a pretty well paying job in it for my age and level of education  i also enjoy my job a lot  i have a small but amazing family and some close irl friends as well as online friends i speak with and game with regularly  i usually meet these guys for a few days once or twice a year to play some board games  i have many things in my life that i enjoy and should be happy about  yet i feel so incredibly empty  like nothing matters   i never feel this way when i m with friends family  playing games with online friends or hanging out with my gf  but as soon as i m alone  i can t stop thinking  whats the point    i m not sad and i actively don t want to end my life  but i don t see the point in continuing my existance either   does anyone else feel the same way  how does one deal with it ,depression
t3_dl5nhl,Debbie1300,life is not worth it ,i don t care about anyone or anything or what  i desire  what i love  what i want in this life what anyone has or that anyone is moving forward than me and is more successful than  me and has what they want in life because life is not worth it  i m done wasting time on things that don t benefit me and make me feel worse and my expectations are never met because reality sucks and is a total bummer  i m so unimportant and upset that i can t cope with life and i don t care about any opportunities that come my way or anything people have to offer or say because i feel so offended by life and that i think to myself why do i bother living and i feel guilty that i do  i really don t care if i m alone or have no one because nobody accepts me for who i am  i don t feel as enthusiastic and excited as i once was because life is so meaningless and boring and that everyone is joking and having a good spending time by spending time with others they love while i lay lifeless into darkness and despair  i don t care about being happy because i don t deserve to be  i don t care about success because i always fail to reach it  nobody cares about me because i m practically worthless  because who would want a girl like me around when i could be better but i m not  no one would help me or even talk to me because i have no value and i don t matter in this life and that i bother people by existing and that life would be better if i was one less problem for people to not worry about  i don t care about love because it s not true and know i will never get it  my thoughts and feelings aren t worth it because they get worse everyday as well as i m bored and tired of life that is also making me feel worse i don t care if i don t eat to improve my health i don t care if i don t have a great family or friends by my side  i don t care if society pays attention to me or ignores me because i can t stand life  i don t care how much i keep everything inside just to break down in frustration emotional angst because i m not taken seriously and i accept it  because being invisible is what i do best  i don t own life anything because i m sick and tired of people using me to their advantage and simply putting down by going on top of me  to be honest i mess everything up  i m weak and sensitive and use my anger to hide my sadness in order to make myself seem like i m strong in front of people when i m really not  i can t get over the fact that life doesn t give a shit about me and hates me and nobody cares how i feel  and i regret living by waking up everyday alive feeling worthless  unloved and unwanted  i m pushed down and insulted because i m a loser and will never get to be successful no matter how hard i try  i have no one that i can trust that is on my side because my family and friends despise me so much  i m an invisible nervous wreck  i m so afraid of being a failure and an embarrassment in society because i feel like i should better myself but instead i stay average  i think about dying everyday because that s all i look forward to is waiting for my body to stop working and not taking any oxygen  seriously life is killing me in my head and i m so hopeless and emotionally broken  no one likes me or knows me because they have someone or something to focus on and spend time with and i dont  all i do i stay inside  when i go outside people fail to understand me because they can t relate to me and i feel so alone  i m always thinking others are better off without me because life moves on and everyone only cares about themselves  it s never about the pain and suffering i feel because nobody takes me seriously and to be honest no one will ever have time for me help me support me etc  i am the worst girl to have ever been born and i really want to stop feeling like this but i tried everything to make myself feel better and it s not working  i m always in a cruddy upset mood  and will always be tied to my problems and the condition of how i feel  i dont want life forcing me to live  f ck this society   i just want peace quiet and death to happen i m only hurting myself by living ,depression

t3_dl5hpi,Pierre7115,it s hard being the fuck up of the family,being psychotic drunk at least   times a year   getting arrested for public intoxication  splitting your head open because you were to drunk  drinking every night to forget about everything and calm down  it s hard being a disappointment to your one parent and limited family  if you know you know ,depression
t3_dl5frw,riverfellon,does anyone get depressed right after being happy at small victories and then when trying to reach out and celebrate someway   you get disappointed at stupidest of things  ,its like my sad version of me constantly outweighs the joyous version  thankfully i don t have an evil side afaik  the biggest trigger for my unhappiness is seeing other people who seems to have more fun in a day than i will have in my lifetime  actually i have quite a few fun moments but even then i was overthinking and not completely relishing the moment  a few days ago i went to see the movie  joker  all alone and then i saw all these young couple of my age and i actually noticed this nerdy and snobby girl that all of my college thought was too egotistical to get into relationships  she literally talks about dating only millionaires but here she was having someone with them and here i am all alone  but i do have friends but they have different taste in movies and are raging alcoholics  i just want some one sensitive in my life,depression

10/19-10/20 1:22AM. 
I’m sitting here after quite a few shots of rum. Listening to down tempo music. The thoughts in my mind are ones longing for my existence to be over. I don’t want to kill myself but I wish my life was over. The stress of this semester as well as thinking that the person I’ve fallen in love with is going to leave me in about a months time makes me want to not experience any more. 

The reoccurring thought of me hanging by my neck in my closest replays in my mind over and over again. I would never do that to myself but that thought goes through my mind countless times a day. I don’t think I’m a danger to myself but I simply just wish the world would take my in my sleep. I don’t think I’m suicidal but I just don’t want to live any more. If my death was natural it would cause less pain to the people in my life. Just this past Tuesday (10/15/19) I told the girl I have feelings for that if I were to die most people wouldn’t notice for a few weeks. I don’t think my roommates would notice for a few days. I personally think word to my parents would take 2 weeks or more and to the girl I feeling for, I don’t think she would hear of my passing for a month or so. 

The pain that plagued my depressive thoughts comes from a mixture of felling like a failure, to not wanting to let my parents down, to stress from work and classes. I wish I didn’t feel this way and that’s why I wish this world would just make my death an untimely one. Nearly every time I go to sleep I hope that I dint wake up in the morning and that’s if I go to sleep. 

I wish this dull nagging pain in my mind would just end so I can live my life. 

The only time I feel alive is when I travel or when I’m with a bunch of people I care about. 
Even then I feel like the people I care about don’t have reciprocating feelings. 
Maybe I need help. 



10/23 2:47am
Sitting here thinking about her again. I told myself I wouldn’t get played again. I wouldn’t get caught up in emotions so I won’t get hurt when she leaves again. We agreed we wouldn’t take it to there. She started talking about how she showed me off to her family and how her friend told her she should date me. Hearing all of this I caught feelings hard again. I feel her slipping further and further away and I’m not sure if it’s my fault. Is it because I’m depressed? Is it because I freaked her out with how far I’ve fallen for her? Is it because she found someone else, someone better? I’m not sure... 

Feeling like I’m losing grasp on the person I want to love in the future on top of the stress school has me going through is making it hard for me. I want to quit. I’m doing poorly in most of my classes and it’s onto the real world in just a few months. I’m not ready for it. If I can’t get out of bed to go to an hour long class how will I be able to hold a job? I want to just curl up and not exist anymore. 
I don’t want to kill myself because I know there are people that care about me and that would devastate them but I’m honestly not afraid to die. If I went to sleep tonight and didn’t wake up in the morning I don’t think I’d be afraid of that happening. I’ve gone back to not looking both ways when crossing the street in the off chance that a distracted driver helps me escape. I’m not making attempts on my life nor am I planning on doing so. I am just giving up self preservation because I don’t care if I die by external sources anymore. 

My medication helps me sleep but it doesn’t fix my depression. I don’t think I need something to help me sleep I need something that stops these thoughts, I need something that puts me at ease. Alcohol is not a good idea because while I feel good after drinking I hate how I feel the next day, I seem more depressed. My medication for sleep also doesn’t let me drink, and sometimes some days aren’t that bad and I want to have fun or have a drink with my friends but I can’t because of this stupid medication. 

As far as the girl situation goes, as much as I want to bring it up and ask her to reaffirm that nothings wrong I don’t want to make a big deal out of something if it’s nothing and I don’t want to come across insecure. I just wish she was upfront with me. If she doesn’t want to see me don’t give me excuses just tell me why you’d rather not, I’d understand better. I don’t know how you can lie to me and tell me that you are busy with homework and want to see your little brother and then go and get high with your friend. I honestly wouldn’t care if you would rather go and do that just please don’t lie to me. It hurts. I miss you.... I just want to sit down and talk to you. 

I think I’m codependent and in a very bad way. I feel like nothing matters and my depression is gone when she is around and when she talks to me. Lately it just seems like she doesn’t want to see me or talk to me and it’s making the depression come on strong. I need to fix this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression&lt;/p&gt;

my mum has suffered from depression for a long time due to abuse she received as a child. when i was younger i remember her sitting in her room for weeks at a time just staring at the wall with this glassy look in her eyes. that woman is not my mother. 

my mum when she is not suffering from depression is a kind, hardworking and beautiful woman. she is my best friend and we do a lot of stuff together.

at the beginning of this year my parents separated after over 35 years of marriage. my mum's depression basically disappeared after my dad moved out but a few days ago it came back, and now without my dad to take out her sadness on she has turned to me.

i assume she is stressed about our current financial situation, as the money she earns per week is pretty much the same amount the mortgage on our house costs per week. my dad gives me some pocket money and pays for my school fees but she constantly is looking for apartments to rent out of fear that my dad will sell the house (he is a carpenter and he built it, and its in a really good area) even though my dad said he wanted me to graduate while living in the house. 

i grew up helping my mum when she was sad but nothing ever made her happy until my dad moved out. every time she's gotten angry with me over the last few months, even over very small things, she starts screaming and threatening to kick me out. 

i am a good student and i worked really hard to get into the school that i go to today. all of my friends are really studious and i don't hang out with 'the wrong people'. i've never sneaked out, gotten in trouble with the law or done drugs. im a captain at my school and one of the highest achieving students in two high level subjects. yet, if i do one thing wrong like not eating breakfast one morning or watch youtube when i get ready for school, she goes off at me and won't talk to me for the whole day.

now that my dad is gone i have nobody to hide behind or call for help if i need it. she has already tried to kill herself before and she said i was the only thing keeping her alive, so if she hates me, there won't be anything keeping her alive and im scared. i love my mum and so do all her friends and all the kids she works with at her job. i don't know what to do. the situation right now is not bad at all, but i know how bad it can get and i just need advice on how to help her get through her tough times together.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: i need advice on helping my mum as she struggles with depression&lt;/p&gt;

Well since you expressed your view! I will express mine. I am fat! And I gave up trying to lose weight altogether after years long struggle. I am still relatively active though thanks to having to walk 2 to 3 kms a day! But soon I am gonna trying to reduce that too I guess. Society should really enable psychiatric euthanasia actually because nobody really eats themselves to disability with a sound mind. Body positivity is aimed at women who kill themselves for having muffin tops. Not for the cases you described I think 😅

Well to be fair, I am 85 kgs with a BMI bordering on obese ( it is overweight not yet obese). And in reality I wasn’t always fat. I was a national level swimmer, had amazing stamina and military aspirations. Then I got severe asthma ! Could no longer do the sport or any sport for that matter. I was denied medicine because mommy believed exercise and yoga should cure the asthma automatically. I suffered from clinical depression and had a functioning level of depression! Never got treatment till 2 months ago because my mom called me a brat to have my problems be even considered. Tried all sorts of dieting , intensive gymming and calorie count ? Made only 2 to 3 kgs difference after such hardworking. The stretch marks seemed damn ugly anyways! 

Then it dawned upon me! Why should I 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ bother? Stopped exercising altogether since 6 months ( depression doesn’t let me) , stopped giving a fuck about my diet. I forcibly eat fruits and veggies to get my vitamin intake for the day since lack of it will make me sick. I got extreme sugar poisoning so I cut back on that! I bought a dildo so I don’t need to bother about looking pretty for opposite sex! Dildo gives me more orgasms too! Since I have such baggage I am pretty sure that me being thin won’t make a relationship work or find a mate for me. Fat men are plenty anyways and I do find chubby men sexier than leaner men anyways. My stretch marks disappeared since fat reappeared and I feel better about myself already. I eat 3 to 4 meals and I eat whatever I like , whatever is cheap! I don’t intend to live beyond a year or so why should I bother about my future health! And most of all! I don’t really want to please you Lol 😂 

I seriously do think you should help in contributing to psychiatric euthanasia though! Since you are genuinely concerned of taxpayer money! Why should we be a burden on the society when we don’t even want to? Let’s arrive at a win win !”

I came here because I only feel safe talking about this to people I don’t know in real life
They might tell on me
Well I can’t do anything  about this now so here it goes:
I hate my tita ( I’m not from the us so tita means your moms sister)
She used to be someone I loved so fucking much but I can’t deal with this anymore
As I’m writing this I’ve already made a noose.I wanted so badly to be able to make her at least care for me whatever ounce of love she ever had for me is gone.it isnt like I care about her anymore anyways
She’s constantly saying how much of a fun king dissapointment I am and any time I’m ever happy she makes me cry.Anything I did that I’m ever proud of she constantly kills off with insults and tells me to do something worth my time.Earlier she said putang in ka sana mamatay ka.(your moms a whore I hope you die instead)I wish I could cut her out but i can’t! She’s planning to live here( NO THANK YOU)
Imagine telling a fucking nine year old girl that she a disappointment and SHE WILL NEVER GET ANY WHERE IN LIFE NO MATTER HOW SMART I CAN BE.
I love my grandma and she’s trying so hard to make her stop but she’s sick and 69 years old already
My mom said she will bring me to Sweden or Canada with my sister and I want to but I can’t leave my grandma behind( p.s. my mom doesn’t know about this)
The thing is my tita has a daughter ( 1 year old) and I love her so much and IM THE ONE WTCHING OVER HER but if I leave it would mean leaving them behind.As I said earlier I made a noose,a will that gives the pesos i saved up to be given to my family ( ya know except her) but really I don’t want to die! I’m trying to think of a plan to sneak out later tonight
I locked myself in my room right now and don’t wanna go out
I think I’ll give my money to my Lola while she’s asleep later and then leave( I’ll take some to buy instant noodles and to pay for the bus) I don’t want to do this but I will.
If I end up dead I just want to say thanks for reading and if somehow my sister,Lola or baby cousin read this in the near future I want everyone to know that I love you

wish me luck

Just need to vent.

Lately it feels like I’m either drowning or when I try to pull myself back up, I’m just barely treading water. And I get sucked back down. Over and over. 

I’ve tried drinking, sobering up, injuring myself, not injuring myself, try to go to my AA meetings every day, tried meds and therapy for years and gave up because it didn’t work. Tried writing gratitude lists and I’ve been trying to pray for help from God. 

I’m almost to the point of trying to back to a psychiatrist but in the back of my mind, I already know I tried it and it didn’t help. 

People say I think too much and I know I do. I just don’t know what else to do. I want a solution and I want to feel better. So I try to come up with new things to try. Go for walks. Try to eat better. Make sure I keep my grades in college up. Socialize. Take time for just me to try to recuperate. Meditate. Talk about my problems. Don’t talk about my problems - focus on someone else’s drama. Smoke cigarettes, quit smoking, try to moderate my smoking. Make a plan for the future. Say screw it and just wing it. Nothing really helps.

I know my mental health is my responsibility I just don’t know what to do. I know that on the outside things have gotten better. Just bitter because I’d trade it all for this one thing. I do everything I can to make that one thing happen and I can’t do it and it’s killing me. 

Tried to overdose a couple weeks ago and couldn’t follow through. I got halfway through and this small voice in me told me to go lie down and not get back out of my bed no matter what. I’m sure if I had gotten back up I would’ve completed the attempt. 

I’ve tried to reach out to my support group. It kinda seems like no one can help me. They try to but it kinda seems like they don’t have any solution besides “pray more about it” or “try harder” which I’ve tried to do. And it kinda seems like they’re scared to say “Maybe there is no solution” because they’re scared of what I’ll do with that.

It's frustrating that I can acknowledge that this stuff is going on, want to fix it, and still not have the energy or drive to do so. I'm listless and anxious, and even doing normal daily tasks is exhausting.

I don&amp;#39;t deserve to be alive. I have said this before, and I&amp;#39;ll repeat - I should be tortured every day, every second that I breathe. My parts should be cut and then left   around me while I am left alone to die. I deserve the worst forms of torture that anyone can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  apologize to everyone for being alive. I apologize to everyone who has had to ever see me, had to ever hear my voice, or had to look at me. I apologize to everyone who I  looked at. Nobody should have the misfortune to be looked at by a devil like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While traveling to work, I keep my head down focused on the ground so that my eyes do not fall on anyone. When using public transport, if I mistakenly look at someone, I apologize. I avoid any and all outings that I can. I don&amp;#39;t deserve anything. I often have to lie to my parents that I am enjoying and having fun. I am stuck and can&amp;#39;t reveal to anyone how I feel. There are people who care about me and I have to pretend for them.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't know why I'm writing this. I don't necessarily want attention, or deserve it, but nonetheless something in my mind deems it necessary to do. I have been anxious or depressed for the last 9 years of my life. I do not have contentedness on a level in which I can live my life without constantly wanting more out of it. I believe in nothing. I want for nothing in particular and don't know how to express these emotions in a way that wouldn't come across as disgustingly shallow or in any other way for that matter. I am sick. I have mental illness and addictions that simultaneously improve and become the expense of my mental health. It's cyclical now,  weed, pills, alcohol, , self harm,  acid, sobriety, anxiety, depression, weed, pills.... I don't have the patience or optimism to live in denial or hope. I don't want to die. I don't want to end my life. But I also don't know how to escape from my own mind. I hurt myself everyday. Others cannot hurt me because I do not surround myself with people who are capable of such a thing. To know that your life is being lived in  a manner that is detrimental to longevity and contentedness, and simultaneously failing to change habits is paradoxical. But here I am again. Writing to strangers for some type of affirmation that I'm worth something to somebody.

The responses are always the same, but counter intuitively, they make one feel worse. Because, if other express that you benefit their lives even in the smallest way, you're left contemplating why you cannot believe them, or more fittingly, believe yourself when you tell yourself the same things. Life is so very complicated, isn't it? Imagine what mental gymnastics one has to go through to morally justify their position in society. The more I learn about the world and its inhabitants, history, and potential futures, the more I'm left dazed and unsure. Simultaneously grasping for some type of truth and feeling too tired to continue doing so. If one were to try to formulate their thoughts in a completely honest way, I think that nobody would understand them. I think that language lacks the complexity of the human experience. But I guess that's self-evident, given that the human mind created language in the first place.

Therapy is probably the worst thing that someone that thinks like me can go through. It subjects oneself to tremendous trauma, only to be left with coping mechanisms and ignorance strategies. You cannot heal mental trauma when said trauma is inherit to chemical composition. The best human society has done is develop anti psychotic or mental inebriating substances to dull or augment one’s inherit nature. I obviously favor the latter over the former. I write this, significantly intoxicated, waning off something that I never imagined myself taking, and experiencing ups and downs that bring on both fits of euphoric laughter and such despair than I cannot antiquate the feeling to the description of words.

I miss being a child. Before my grandparents died. Before my mother locked herself away from feeling. Before I grew to hate myself. Before I tried to kill myself. Before I regretted it. Before I became an addict. Before I tricked myself out of it. Before I used people for temporary enjoyment. Before I fell in love. Before I was heartbroken. Before I learned what society expects of those in my position. Before I stopped caring about said expectations. Before I sought attention from others by letting my personal issues out to dry.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;m writing this. I don&amp;#39;t necessarily want attention, or deserve it, but nonetheless something in my mind deems it necessary to do. I have been anxious or depressed for the last 9 years of my life. I do not have contentedness on a level in which I can live my life without constantly wanting more out of it. I believe in nothing. I want for nothing in particular and don&amp;#39;t know how to express these emotions in a way that wouldn&amp;#39;t come across as disgustingly shallow or in any other way for that matter. I am sick. I have mental illness and addictions that simultaneously improve and become the expense of my mental health. It&amp;#39;s cyclical now,  weed, pills, alcohol, , self harm,  acid, sobriety, anxiety, depression, weed, pills.... I don&amp;#39;t have the patience or optimism to live in denial or hope. I don&amp;#39;t want to die. I don&amp;#39;t want to end my life. But I also don&amp;#39;t know how to escape from my own mind. I hurt myself everyday. Others cannot hurt me because I do not surround myself with people who are capable of such a thing. To know that your life is being lived in  a manner that is detrimental to longevity and contentedness, and simultaneously failing to change habits is paradoxical. But here I am again. Writing to strangers for some type of affirmation that I&amp;#39;m worth something to somebody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The responses are always the same, but counter intuitively, they make one feel worse. Because, if other express that you benefit their lives even in the smallest way, you&amp;#39;re left contemplating why you cannot believe them, or more fittingly, believe yourself when you tell yourself the same things. Life is so very complicated, isn&amp;#39;t it? Imagine what mental gymnastics one has to go through to morally justify their position in society. The more I learn about the world and its inhabitants, history, and potential futures, the more I&amp;#39;m left dazed and unsure. Simultaneously grasping for some type of truth and feeling too tired to continue doing so. If one were to try to formulate their thoughts in a completely honest way, I think that nobody would understand them. I think that language lacks the complexity of the human experience. But I guess that&amp;#39;s self-evident, given that the human mind created language in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therapy is probably the worst thing that someone that thinks like me can go through. It subjects oneself to tremendous trauma, only to be left with coping mechanisms and ignorance strategies. You cannot heal mental trauma when said trauma is inherit to chemical composition. The best human society has done is develop anti psychotic or mental inebriating substances to dull or augment one’s inherit nature. I obviously favor the latter over the former. I write this, significantly intoxicated, waning off something that I never imagined myself taking, and experiencing ups and downs that bring on both fits of euphoric laughter and such despair than I cannot antiquate the feeling to the description of words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss being a child. Before my grandparents died. Before my mother locked herself away from feeling. Before I grew to hate myself. Before I tried to kill myself. Before I regretted it. Before I became an addict. Before I tricked myself out of it. Before I used people for temporary enjoyment. Before I fell in love. Before I was heartbroken. Before I learned what society expects of those in my position. Before I stopped caring about said expectations. Before I sought attention from others by letting my personal issues out to dry.&lt;/p&gt;

As the title says, I'm afraid that my little brother (15, M) may have depression and I don't know what to do.
He's always been an introvert and rarely shares/talks with anyone but my mom and me. He has no close friends, or at least, he doesn't go to anybody else's house after school not invites anyone home. I was a loner at his age to and have anxiety myself, and even though I know how it feels, I don't know how to help him.
My parents have noticed his behavior as well and talked to him, he agreed to go see a psychologist a few weeks ago (When he was going through what I believe one of his depressive episodes) but today, on his first session, when the psychologist asked him why he was there, he simply said ""I don't know, my parents brought me here"" and later today my mom said ""Maybe he doesn't really need it"".

I have another sister (13, F), and one day the three of us were talking about life, and he goes ""Some people may want to kill themselves but they wouldn't, I'm talking from experience"" and I just froze. I couldn't respond, I couldn't say anything neither could my sister. I haven't been able to tell my mom about this, I just can't, I don't know why. Today was the perfect opportunity, I had the chance to tell her about it, but I simply couldn't.

How would a parent feel if one of their kids told them another one of his kids has thought about killing himself? How do I say tell my mom about it? I don't even know if he actually feels that way or if he wants to try going with the psychologist again, I don't know how to ask him, but at the same time I need him to get help, I don't want him to live like this.

Earlier today my girlfriend told me we needed to talk after I got off work. Fearing the worst, I had constant panic attacks throughout the day. 

To make a long story short; it's not about us per say, ""we"" are fine, it's moreso what happened before we started going out

My girlfriend had...unconsentual sex 2 weeks before we started dated (a little over a month and some change ago). 

Today, she found out that she is pregnant with his child and thast what she wanted to talk about 

I did my best to put on a brave and strong face, but I'm honestly terrified and severely depressed 

She has no plans to keep thekid and has already set an appointment for the procedure 

Now she's stressed that her insurance won't cover it, so I told her I'd cover the cost of it because I honestly see a real future with her. I've told her many times that if I could marry her tomorrow, I would. She is that greay and I couldn't be happier with her

The only reason I'm acting like I am is because I've had these experiences while I was going through emt school

I've never told ANYONE this, but during my ER shift, one of my patients was a gangrape victim come to find out later that she was in this very situation. 

Without giving our much info, she attempted to end it all with a firearm, but failed, and now has to live with the deformities of it. 

As soon as my girlfriend told me this, all of my past experiences in the fire department and emt (that I've tried to forget) hit me like a freight train and I just don't know how to handle it

I'm attempting to drink myself to sleep, but as you can see it ain't working too well.

&lt;p&gt;I did my best to put on a brave and strong face, but I&amp;#39;m honestly terrified and severely depressed &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has no plans to keep thekid and has already set an appointment for the procedure &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now she&amp;#39;s stressed that her insurance won&amp;#39;t cover it, so I told her I&amp;#39;d cover the cost of it because I honestly see a real future with her. I&amp;#39;ve told her many times that if I could marry her tomorrow, I would. She is that greay and I couldn&amp;#39;t be happier with her&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason I&amp;#39;m acting like I am is because I&amp;#39;ve had these experiences while I was going through emt school&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never told ANYONE this, but during my ER shift, one of my patients was a gangrape victim come to find out later that she was in this very situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without giving our much info, she attempted to end it all with a firearm, but failed, and now has to live with the deformities of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as my girlfriend told me this, all of my past experiences in the fire department and emt (that I&amp;#39;ve tried to forget) hit me like a freight train and I just don&amp;#39;t know how to handle it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m attempting to drink myself to sleep, but as you can see it ain&amp;#39;t working too well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this girl more than life itself, and all I want to do is help people. I just don&amp;#39;t know how to help the one person I love the most and it&amp;#39;s killing me&lt;/p&gt;

-Boring Story you can leave if you want.-

I was mistreated and lost trust in life. People made me happy for a bit, until they were untrustworthy. I couldn't tell if they are here for me or my stuff. And it messed me up. Trust issues led to social anxiety which led to depression. And that led to bullying. I can't do anything about it. And I... Don't want to? It's difficult. If I try to do something about it, I'll mess up somebody else's life in the process, somehow. And because I'm the therapist in all my friend groups, I'm never being cared for.

There's no reason to live if I can't help people. And once I help that person, they don't talk to me until they need another problem fixed. But recently, I've found someone who is a therapist like me, so I am no longer needed for anybody.


When I start this, I am distancing myself from my friends and staying away from people in general.

I’ve battled depression and suicidal tendencies for years (about 7 years). I haven’t had a friend since 9th grade. I’m now 21 in my second to last semester of college and will be graduating with 2 bachelors degrees. I lost most of my belongings because I was  dumped and kicked out a year ago and left homeless for a month. She was cheating on me while she was supposedly out with friends. It culminated in her saying she was done and I needed to move out. She expected me out in a hour, so I lost important belongings and even my cats because she called the police and almost had me arrested. She got to keep most of my things except my recording equipment, a chair, and my laptop. I’m surviving, but I just feel completely empty. I don’t interact with anyone. I don’t think I utter a word to a single person in a given week. I talk to myself kinda since I pay rent by doing voice work for advertisers and such, but it doesn’t pay very well. I get the flexibility I need out of that work which is nice. 

But I’m generally always alone. I haven’t spoken to my family in 5 years except my brother, but that’s gone. My brother was the only contact I had, but he passed away over a year ago. I didn’t even get to go to the funeral or know he died until his wife posted it on facebook... I don’t have a desire to connect with anyone and I don’t worry about dating since it’s not worth the emotional pain or effort. I’ve mitigated my social network to merely work contacts that I never see in person.

My life is hinged on whether I get into graduate school or not. I’ve only been passionate about one particular field of study within the discipline of sociology so it’s limited the masters programs I have to choose from. If I don’t get in... honestly I’ll be left with nothing. I’m barely making rent, I haven’t had medical insurance in over 3 years. I barely make my car payment and I’m just lost.

I haven’t planned for not getting into graduate school because if I don’t I’m pretty much done. Where I live I could never get a job with my degrees. Even if I could I wouldn’t want to because I only get enjoyment from researching and conducting studies. Everything else I don’t have the capacity to do anymore.

I kind of don't know where to start with this, so I'll just start and see where it goes.  


so, a few months ago, I started at a program called Job Corps. I'm currently taking Office Administration, and that's been going pretty well for me. But, recently, especially today, I've been feeling like nothing has been going right for me. I feel like nobody ever wants to be around me, and that they all just want to push me away. The few friends I did make here, except one, have all been treating me like shit lately, wether it be making fun of me behind my back, to my face, or just ignoring me. The only time their ever nice to me is when I have something they want, which is generally fuckin money, which I don't have (we get paid less than $25 every 2 weeks. Its honestly bullshit). The one person I'm able to talk to about this stuff is back home now, because he completed the program. I used to be able to talk to my boyfriend about stuff like this, but he's always busy with his own life. I understand that though. Except now, I'm unable to talk to him altogether. About the only thing I had to talk to him, or my parents was my laptop, but about 2 weeks ago, I was pushed down the stairs by this jackass, and ended up landing on it, fucking up the screen and a bunch of shit inside it. The center I'm at usually refunds students for stuff like that, but apparently, it's only for stuff under a certain price range, and mine was about $100 OVER the price range. The worst part about that, is the amount of music projects I lot. Almost 3 years worth. It's not like it mattered anyway, I wasn't an good at it. Can't get it fixed either because the center was built on top of a fucking mountain and we have to apply to get off. Don't know how I'm going to talk to my boyfriend or parents for a while I don't have a phone and repairing the damn thing would be a waste of time because it would just get fucked up anyway, and I don't have the money to fucking replace the damn thing either. Having to type this shit on one of the center computers that are super restrictive for no fucking reason, just so I can get some of this shit off my chest. I'm just rambling at this point, but i dont really care. I'm usually able to deal with this type of stuff, but today was just.... fucking shit. For starters, it was pay day today, and they cut my pay in half. Of the $23 we normally get, I only got 10. So that pissed me off. Then, my ""roommates"" complained about me and they all got switched out of the room. I have no idea what they said about me, because I don't even talk to them, but now I'm having to see the center director tomorrow, and I don't know what for. I know I didn't break any rules, so I'm not getting terminated, but I still think it's bullshit. Honestly, the more I'm writng this, the more angry I'm getting over how much bullshit has gone on just today alone. I've just been feeling worthless, and unwanted for a while now, and I honestly was pushed over my breaking point today. Sorry for those of you that read this, I'm just having a shitty fucking few weeks and need to vent a bit. Sorry. I didn't mean for this to turn into such an angry post. I'll probably just leave.

I'll probably do very badly.  I was supposed to finish high school last year but dropped out two weeks into year twelve. I couldn't handle it anymore. I let other people talk me into trying again after a year. Take a break, they said. Guess what, the break did absolutely nothing for me except make me feel like a failure.

I'm 19. I never thought I'd make it so far and subsequently I never prepared for adult life. I never made an effort to gather work experience or even try to find a career path for me. 
Now I have come to a horrifying realization, I really really don't want to die. I like living. So the easy way out is just no option for me anymore and I just sort of have to stumble forward and I'm so tired of it. 
I tried to kill myself when I was 16. I remember feeling so happy as I fell asleep because I thought it would finally be over - the 'stumbling forward'. I thought, even if I survived, if someone found me, I'd go to hospital and something would happen and my life would change and I wouldn't have to cluelessly wander through life anymore, unsure if I even wanted it, every step a struggle. Of course, I just woke up and I had to get rid of the evidence and clean up a huge mess and blood and it was the worst day of my life and I had to continue on like nothing happened. 

I used to go to therapy until about two months ago. I went there for a little over a year. It didn't help me at all, I made no progress whatsoever. I told my therapist I didn't want to see her anymore and I haven't made an effort to find a new therapist since. I'm not even sure if I want a new therapist. I have very little time now with school.
I hate school. I hate school so much, I always have. I feel like I can't drop out now because I already have one failed attempt. I am mad at other people for talking me into going back and I am more mad at myself for letting them. I wish I'd stuck to my original plan. I could be working right now.

The thing is, I don't do terrible in school in general. I'm good at my mothertongue and I get As in English. I like philosophy and law, biology and geography. I do pretty well in these subjects, too. BUT where I'm from, the oral grade counts 60-70% of the final grade. I don't like talking in front of the class, so I get bad oral grades and my written grades do little to improve that. In addition to that, there are the subjects I don't like. Math, P.E., French, Theatre. Those truly make school torture for me. The worst thing is, it never gets easier. It doesn't matter if I make it through French on monday, there's Math waiting for me on Tuesday. It doesn't matter if I make it through the entire week, there will be another one after the weekend. It never stops. 

I feel so helpless. I don't want to go on but I feel like I have no choice.

I’ve felt worthless for over a while now I think it started when I was about nine, I could go into details but I don’t think it’s important. To get to the point I want to just not exist. I know somethings wrong with me, I don’t know if I’m just overly sensitive, depressed, bipolar or what but I’m rarely happy and I’m always down and have this thing about me where everyone leaves my life one way or another. I came to the conclusion that I’m toxic or boring or something’s seriously wrong with me because I have nobody and have nothing to live for which I guess is selfish. I’ve tried getting help but whenever I used to reach out for help I’d get the worst responses. The first time I asked for help was in middle school when I asked my mother if she could help me and that I was feeling really sad and stressed and she said that everything gets better and I just had to get through that time. 6th grade was a lot for me because a lot of events happened that just impacted my entire life and mindset and views on the world. I started to cut myself because I didn’t know what else to do and then I went to school with cuts on my forearm and someone saw it and told me I was an attention whore. He said “you’re such an attention whore if you really wanted to kill your self try vertical that should do it.” So I nodded my head and said thanks, I went home and slit my wrist with a 7 inch incision  going down  my arm and I remember being on the floor home alone screaming because it hurt so fucking bad, I was getting mad because I wasn’t dying it just fucking hurt and I wanted it to stop! So I got the knife and stabbed my arm and that’s all I remember. I woke up in the hospital... all I could think was I’m such a failure at life that I cant even kill myself right. Then I came tie the realization that someone must’ve taken me to the hospital, later I found out it was my mother who found me and took me to the hospital. I immediately started crying when my mom came into my room I was apologizing and she just didn’t say anything. I felt so shitty because I was selfish... it was wrong of me but I didn’t care at the time. After my mom saw me the doctors came back in with policemen and I saw my arms and they were handcuffed to the bed. They then took me to Loma Linda where I was put on a 5150 and stripped my mother of all her rights for 3 days. They made me strip... and I don’t want to go into detail because I’m still not over it. It was demeaning and I’ve never felt so numb, gone. It changed me forever, I was emasculated no longer did I feel like a man or boy just nothing. I felt embarrassed then nothing just like that. Then was I really sure I wanted to die, I hated that place and still do. The people there were rude and mean and made me feel crappy. I remember lying so I could get out of that place because I wanted to leave so bad. When I finally was let go my mom took me home and when we got home she didn’t speak to me, not one word. Afterwards my mother the next morning came to me before I left for school, looked me in the eye and said “If I see that shit again on your arm I’ll do it myself but make sure you don’t live this time.” At that moment I do feel like I lost everyone in my life that was it for me. I didn’t try again because I was scared of failing and doing all that again. As time went on I still tried getting help, I thought I was getting better freshman year in high school. I was on the football team made some new friends and was doing good in school with straight A’s. It’s like whenever I think I’m happy or okay something bad always happens, it’s like I can’t ever be happy. I remember asking my mom for help and she would just tell me that things would get better like she was in denial or she’d say it’s puberty and hormones which got me mad at the time so I said okay and went to my room. I asked again sophomore year for help and she said no, that it’d be on my record and mess up my future. As time passed and the older I got, the worst my life got. Junior year after actually begging on my knees for help my mom called me pathetic and said that she’d get me a counselor. I saw progress, she taught me about impossible people and how to deal with my depression and PTSD and social anxiety etc. I noticed my mom struggling with payments and her job and providing for the family and I have 2 younger siblings, I knew it was the counselor that was taking the money. So I went into the office on my next appointment and said I’m fine. That I was cured and lied my ass off, I said the nightmares stopped, I was happy and content and wouldn’t waste time on negativity or the past etc. She then asked me if I was sure and I smiled and said yes I’m positive, she discharged me and never saw me again.

I’ve felt worthless for over a while now I think it started when I was about nine, I could go into details but I don’t think it’s important. To get to the point I want to just not exist. I know somethings wrong with me, I don’t know if I’m just overly sensitive, depressed, bipolar or what but I’m rarely happy and I’m always down and have this thing about me where everyone leaves my life one way or another. I came to the conclusion that I’m toxic or boring or something’s seriously wrong with me because I have nobody and have nothing to live for which I guess is selfish. I’ve tried getting help but whenever I used to reach out for help I’d get the worst responses. The first time I asked for help was in middle school when I asked my mother if she could help me and that I was feeling really sad and stressed and she said that everything gets better and I just had to get through that time. 6th grade was a lot for me because a lot of events happened that just impacted my entire life and mindset and views on the world. I started to cut myself because I didn’t know what else to do and then I went to school with cuts on my forearm and someone saw it and told me I was an attention whore. He said “you’re such an attention whore if you really wanted to kill your self try vertical that should do it.” So I nodded my head and said thanks, I went home and slit my wrist with a 7 inch incision  going down  my arm and I remember being on the floor home alone screaming because it hurt so fucking bad, I was getting mad because I wasn’t dying it just fucking hurt and I wanted it to stop! So I got the knife and stabbed my arm and that’s all I remember. I woke up in the hospital... all I could think was I’m such a failure at life that I cant even kill myself right. Then I came tie the realization that someone must’ve taken me to the hospital, later I found out it was my mother who found me and took me to the hospital. I immediately started crying when my mom came into my room I was apologizing and she just didn’t say anything. I felt so shitty because I was selfish... it was wrong of me but I didn’t care at the time. After my mom saw me the doctors came back in with policemen and I saw my arms and they were handcuffed to the bed. They then took me to Loma Linda where I was put on a 5150 and stripped my mother of all her rights for 3 days. They made me strip... and I don’t want to go into detail because I’m still not over it. It was demeaning and I’ve never felt so numb, gone. It changed me forever, I was emasculated no longer did I feel like a man or boy just nothing. I felt embarrassed then nothing just like that. Then was I really sure I wanted to die, I hated that place and still do. The people there were rude and mean and made me feel crappy. I remember lying so I could get out of that place because I wanted to leave so bad. When I finally was let go my mom took me home and when we got home she didn’t speak to me, not one word. Afterwards my mother the next morning came to me before I left for school, looked me in the eye and said “If I see that shit again on your arm I’ll do it myself but make sure you don’t live this time.” At that moment I do feel like I lost everyone in my life that was it for me. I didn’t try again because I was scared of failing and doing all that again. As time went on I still tried getting help, I thought I was getting better freshman year in high school. I was on the football team made some new friends and was doing good in school with straight A’s. It’s like whenever I think I’m happy or okay something bad always happens, it’s like I can’t ever be happy. I remember asking my mom for help and she would just tell me that things would get better like she was in denial or she’d say it’s puberty and hormones which got me mad at the time so I said okay and went to my room. I asked again sophomore year for help and she said no, that it’d be on my record and mess up my future. As time passed and the older I got, the worst my life got. Junior year after actually begging on my knees for help my mom called me pathetic and said that she’d get me a counselor. I saw progress, she taught me about impossible people and how to deal with my depression and PTSD and social anxiety etc. I noticed my mom struggling with payments and her job and providing for the family and I have 2 younger siblings, I knew it was the counselor that was taking the money. So I went into the office on my next appointment and said I’m fine. That I was cured and lied my ass off, I said the nightmares stopped, I was happy and content and wouldn’t waste time on negativity or the past etc. She then asked me if I was sure and I smiled and said yes I’m positive, she discharged me and never saw me again. I regretted doing that because I was slowly going back into my life and when I tried to read those stupid papers that would “help me” or write my thoughts down or preform any of the techniques I was taught they just didn’t work. It’s like it was all false. I sucked it up though because I had too. I was the only other somewhat grown up in the house, my dad wasn’t in the picture and I did it for my siblings.

I’m not really complaining, I’m just saying that I can’t develop any new memories because my life currently is so bland, uninteresting. I can’t seem to remember what I did last week, or even yesterday because the days are so similar.

Tomorrow's is my birthday, but I'm not happy about it.  Happiness is an aberration in my life.  In high school I thought of ending my life nearly everyday, but I didn't.  Now I am a graduate student and lately I have been extremely depressed by a number of things that have piled up over the past few months. For starters, I had 7 friends graduate and move on with their lives this past summer. I really miss seeing them every day. More will leave in the coming year and I wonder if they will remember me. I'm not the funniest or interesting person they've known, but I tried to spend time with them before they left, at the expense of spending time with my family. One of them recently came back and invited some of my friends for drinks.  I opened up to this friend about my social awkwardness and the loss that  I felt over the summer.  He seemed very supportive and shared similar experiences in his life and how he got over them.  So I thought that when he came back he would've invited me to hang out.  Instead, I never got an invitation and later I found out that he wanted to hang out with those that he had a deeper connection with, which we didn't have. Even though we got lunch before I found this out, I still feel gloomy about not being invited after all that I invested.

This past summer 3 people I knew died: one of my cousins, a middle school/high school friend who likely died of drugs, and a welcoming grandmother-like figure in my community.

There's more. I had a crush on someone in my program. Early this year she started inviting me to lunch and other events with her friends, which was a pleasant surprise because I almost always initiated those things. She had rejected me before, but now I thought perhaps she had a change of heart. I didn't focus on asking her whether this was the case because of my past experience and also because I was in a harrowing struggle that I won to remain in my graduate program (I cannot disclose anything about this for fear of retaliation, but someone was trying to get rid of me from my program. That person failed). It seemed that everything with my crush was going well, but after a friend's wedding in late April, she stopped initiating those invitations (even though I continued to invite her to lunch with friends). To make a long story short, I heard recently she's dating one of my good friends who left the program.

When I found out about this, I felt devastated, really devastated. I was in a depressed state before this happened, but now it's unimaginably worse. She is a very kind person that grew on me over the years. I feel so stupid and evil for thinking that things were going in the right direction. I feel so disgusted at the thought that I bothered or made her feel uncomfortable. I feel bad that she has to deal with this in her new relationship.  My crush told me that we need to take space from each other. When I apologized for placing her in this situation and for any times that I made her feel uncomfortable, she thanked me. That made me feel worried that there were times when I made her feel uncomfortable. So I texted her this question, but she said that my texts were making her feel uncomfortable. With that, I haven't contacted her 3 weeks and I haven't seen her in nearly a month. I don't have any intention of doing so anytime soon. But this doesn't lessen the worry that I caused her discomfort. It also hurts me socially because I cannot hang out with friends that know her. I'm trying to avoid venues where she will show up. Negative thoughts like ""I want to be turned into roadkill"" or ""I should receive the death penalty"" have come to my mind. I have absolutely no intention of ending my life, but it's been very difficult lately and almost every day I'm sobbing. This is excruciating.   

How can I be happy tomorrow when everything ended up like this?  It's like my life is a bad set of cards that I got and I feel like it's time to fold...

One of them recently came back and invited some of my friends for drinks.  I opened up to this friend about my social awkwardness and the loss that  I felt over the summer.  He seemed very supportive and shared similar experiences in his life and how he got over them.  So I thought that when he came back he would&amp;#39;ve invited me to hang out.  Instead, I never got an invitation and later I found out that he wanted to hang out with those that he had a deeper connection with, which we didn&amp;#39;t have. Even though we got lunch before I found this out, I still feel gloomy about not being invited after all that I invested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past summer 3 people I knew died: one of my cousins, a middle school/high school friend who likely died of drugs, and a welcoming grandmother-like figure in my community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s more. I had a crush on someone in my program. Early this year she started inviting me to lunch and other events with her friends, which was a pleasant surprise because I almost always initiated those things. She had rejected me before, but now I thought perhaps she had a change of heart. I didn&amp;#39;t focus on asking her whether this was the case because of my past experience and also because I was in a harrowing struggle that I won to remain in my graduate program (I cannot disclose anything about this for fear of retaliation, but someone was trying to get rid of me from my program. That person failed). It seemed that everything with my crush was going well, but after a friend&amp;#39;s wedding in late April, she stopped initiating those invitations (even though I continued to invite her to lunch with friends). To make a long story short, I heard recently she&amp;#39;s dating one of my good friends who left the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I found out about this, I felt devastated, really devastated. I was in a depressed state before this happened, but now it&amp;#39;s unimaginably worse. She is a very kind person that grew on me over the years. I feel so stupid and evil for thinking that things were going in the right direction. I feel so disgusted at the thought that I bothered or made her feel uncomfortable. I feel bad that she has to deal with this in her new relationship.  My crush told me that we need to take space from each other. When I apologized for placing her in this situation and for any times that I made her feel uncomfortable, she thanked me. That made me feel worried that there were times when I made her feel uncomfortable. So I texted her this question, but she said that my texts were making her feel uncomfortable. With that, I haven&amp;#39;t contacted her 3 weeks and I haven&amp;#39;t seen her in nearly a month. I don&amp;#39;t have any intention of doing so anytime soon. But this doesn&amp;#39;t lessen the worry that I caused her discomfort. It also hurts me socially because I cannot hang out with friends that know her. I&amp;#39;m trying to avoid venues where she will show up. Negative thoughts like &amp;quot;I want to be turned into roadkill&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I should receive the death penalty&amp;quot; have come to my mind. I have absolutely no intention of ending my life, but it&amp;#39;s been very difficult lately and almost every day I&amp;#39;m sobbing. This is excruciating.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I be happy tomorrow when everything ended up like this?  It&amp;#39;s like my life is a bad set of cards that I got and I feel like it&amp;#39;s time to fold...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post.&lt;/p&gt;

So now I’m almost sure that I have chronic depression but when I’m feeling real down more than I am in general I think back to how just perfect that experience was and I remember the view and listen to the song and I get happy for a bit.

I have a job I don't hate, but it is exhausting and unpredictable and doesn't pay the bills. I lost my old job that I SUPER hated back in February, and with it my health insurance, so I had to stop taking my antidepressants. Even then I couldn't afford therapy, so I definitely can't now. I don't have a degree and desperately want to go back to school, but have just enough in delinquent student loans that I feel I can never make that right/get funding again. I failed out of college twice because of undiagnosed major depression (+ anxiety, + OCD which WAS diagnosed but not treated). When I look back on my time in college it truly feels like a nightmare, one where all the walls are melting into time and space and I can't even trust my own mind or body. 

I hate my personality and have about four friends, two of whom live near me and one of whom is moving to the other side of the world in a few months. I hate everything about my looks and body, and sometimes feel violently sick after thinking about/seeing myself in the mirror. 

I like art and writing but trying to work on anything massively triggers my feelings of worthlessness and pointlessness. 

I don't feel like there's anything I can do. Beyond making things better, just to make things okay. The worst part is, I've only gotten to the point of being suicidal once, like seven years ago, and I didn't do it bc I didn't want people to have nothing worth remembering me for. So like, I get to just be nothing forever. And if I did get to that point, then I get to be the asshole who ruined people's lives by killing herself. People are always like, ""oh, don't you want to live to see [THING] happen?"" and yeah, I do. That's the problem. I have to live through a hundred days feeling like this to see one day feeling like that. A hundred days that each feel like a thousand years to see one day that makes me feel - not even normal, but fleetingly happy. 

I don't want to go to bed because then I have to lay alone with my thoughts, but I don't want to stay awake, because it feels like my life has become nothing but tending to my anxiety and depression. You know how, when you talk to a counselor, they're always like ""can you distract yourself?"". Sure. I can. But that's all I do. I'm just. Fully. Stuck. And at this point, I've been stuck for so long, what's the point of getting unstuck?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with depression for about seventeen years now, and the hardest feeling for me is still feeling /stuck/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a job I don&amp;#39;t hate, but it is exhausting and unpredictable and doesn&amp;#39;t pay the bills. I lost my old job that I SUPER hated back in February, and with it my health insurance, so I had to stop taking my antidepressants. Even then I couldn&amp;#39;t afford therapy, so I definitely can&amp;#39;t now. I don&amp;#39;t have a degree and desperately want to go back to school, but have just enough in delinquent student loans that I feel I can never make that right/get funding again. I failed out of college twice because of undiagnosed major depression (+ anxiety, + OCD which WAS diagnosed but not treated). When I look back on my time in college it truly feels like a nightmare, one where all the walls are melting into time and space and I can&amp;#39;t even trust my own mind or body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate my personality and have about four friends, two of whom live near me and one of whom is moving to the other side of the world in a few months. I hate everything about my looks and body, and sometimes feel violently sick after thinking about/seeing myself in the mirror. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like art and writing but trying to work on anything massively triggers my feelings of worthlessness and pointlessness. &lt;/p&gt;

I’m 24 and I live with my mom, she works 6 days a week so that she can fucking keep a roof over my head. And what do I do? I sleep and cry all day and never leave the fucking apartment. 

I don’t even have friends, like I lost everyone from highschool because I’ve always sucked and when I can’t pretend to not suck anymore people fucking hit the road like it’s so easy for everyone else to make new friends and not suck.

I was stuck inside a school gym with no windows, no sunlight, and no fresh air; so that definitely didn’t help me. That day, well, I guess it was yesterday, my best friend wasn’t at school, so I was pretty much alone all day. Everyone was talking with their friends and teammates at this program, and I had no one. 

All day, I couldn’t see my boyfriend. I don’t depend on him for my happiness, but he does help me when I’m struggling. Last night we also couldn’t FaceTime like we do most nights because he was out all night. So that was not helping me. 

When I say I want to die, I don’t mean by the typical suicidal way. I mean, I want to be involved in a car accident. I’d want to run off the road or run into something at a high speed or have someone else hit my car. Most of the time I drive I’m alone, and I feel absolutely nothing. It’s weird, feeling that way. It’s like you know that you’re supposed to have feelings, but they aren’t there. 

Today I showered for the first time in 5 days. I know that some people with depression go weeks without showering, but I thought that this was a good thing. 

If you can’t tell, my mind is all over the place right now. 

Today someone was wrong with my boyfriend and he wouldn’t tell me what it was. When that happens, I know that it is really bothering him and that he could be in a dark place as well. Every time he’s in a depressive episode, I try to act all cheery and nice. Today I was completely 100% acting. 

I have a shit ton of school work due Thursday, almost none of which I’ve started. My free time is just consumed by these thoughts of dying. I honestly cannot see a future for myself. I don’t see me graduating high school, going to college, moving out, getting married... I don’t see myself doing any of it. 

I feel like I’m not supposed to be where I am. At this point in my life, I don’t care what happens to me. I hope someone runs me off the road. I hope I get into an accident. I hope I am able to just escape.  

I don’t know what my purpose in writing this was. I guess I just wanted to write down my feelings. If you’ve made it this far, I’m sorry that I took a portion of your life for you to read this.

I don&amp;#39;t feel like I&amp;#39;m able to express how much distress I&amp;#39;m in when I try to tell others, I&amp;#39;ve even been to therapy twice and both time I was frustrated that the therapists didn&amp;#39;t see how bad I was exactly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ve been aware of this for a long time, as I literally am majoring in psychology just because I feel like no one can help me but myself. But this is becoming too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like my entire being is suffering. In my head, I think about dying almost every day. I don&amp;#39;t see the point in anything and nothing makes me feel good. But on the other hand, I&amp;#39;ve never self-harmed or made a plan to kill myself. I almost feel bad because it feels like others have it worse, and I&amp;#39;m complaining for nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

I grew up loving life was very sporty and very popular in school, I could get any girl I wanted etc. But this was early, all before 14. At that age my mum forced me to move out of catchment to a school with far better grades leaving all my great relationships behind (it’s the only mistake she’s ever made my mums amazing). 

It was so tough at that age to transition into a completely new school life and I was constantly anxious and despite always being popular at previous schools I never spoke to a girl for two years at that school. This kind of isolation and change I believe led my mental health down the wrong path.

I’ve smoked a ton of weed since I was 12 and and have had depressive thoughts since around when I moved school but I brushed them aside as they weren’t so tragic.

However now at 21 I have had serious suicidal thoughts daily for the past couple of years and one day after resisting drugs my whole life I was crying myself to bed one time and said to myself this really is enough I’ve battled this shit for 7 years, I don’t deserve it and it’s gradually got tragically worse, so I finally tried MDMA and of course it was the greatest experience ever. 

I’ve since then done MDMA about 20 times in 2 months which I know is ridiculously stupid and has fucked my brain chemistry, however I don’t crave it so I’ve got over that stupid binge now. I’ve recently been binging on Xanax too. The crazy thing is I haven’t had any serious comedowns from these drugs ever (just tiredness and a lack of appetite), even with doing shifts on 1 hour sleep etc. I’ve also felt brighter these last two months since I started doing hard drugs, that will most probably change I know.

I have serious thoughts of suicide everyday and the voice in my head just pounds me with the things that it knows upset me most. Over the years I’ve become so subdued with my parents and our relationship has never been the same, maybe because I’m just living one big lie. It’s like I live two completely different lives.

In honesty most of my depressive and suicidal feelings have stemmed from the fact of being so lonely everyday, feeling worthless and like no one gives a shit about me which is so hard as I used to be popular and someone people looked up to.

The fact I could get any girl at one point and now I’m a 21 year old loser who’s only had one sexual partner in the last 4 years and having no one show any kind of interest at all is totally demoralising now, most people grow and blossom out as they grow older, I’ve became the opposite. 

I have never shared such a thing and thank anyone who’s took time to read this, I’ve gone from loving life to wondering why I’m living it and suffering awful pain almost everyday.

Is there anyone feeling a similar kind of way and what changes can I make in my life to see an improvement and maybe put a true smile back on my face one day?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I don’t know who’s going to see this but I wanted to share a little on my life story.&lt;/p&gt;

All my friends are married with great jobs whereas I am so lucky to get just one date and if I do, I usually blow it. It’s an endless cycle of shittiness with no light at the end of the tunnel. Just more darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

my wife and i have had a pretty rocky marriage, pretty much the whole time. i was undiagnosed for a long time, and she had a pretty traumatic childhood. well, now it seems like things are over. and i don't know if i'm an abusive prick, she's a manipulative gaslighter, or both. but everything is pretty fucked right now. i \*really\* wish i could just die, but we have a 3 year old daughter who is the only bright spot in my life, and i've read that children of suicides are something like 5x more likely to commit suicide themselves, so if nothing else i have to hold on for her.

but i just don't know how to manage that. how do you live for someone who you can't ever explain to that you're doing it without unfairly burdening them, how do you ignore all the other shit in life and focus on that one reason to live? i want nothing but the best for her, hell even for my wife, but i don't what ""the best"" even is. will she be better off without me in her life? will she even want a dad who's the wreck of a person that I am? a fuck up who took til 34 to finish his degree, who got fired from his cushy IT job and lost our house when she was 6 months old, who her mother says is a selfish abusive asshole who doesn't care about anyone but himself? maybe i really am, i don't even know how to tell. do i believe her because she's right, or because i hate myself? do i not have any friends because i'm a piece of shit, or because i isolated myself from them? i don't know how to tell, and if i can't figure it out then how can i do what's best for my baby girl? is my wanting to be in her life a sign of love, or selfishness? and how the fuck am i supposed to tell?

i'm sorry, i don't expect answers to any of these questions, i just don't have anywhere else i can even voice them. if you've read this far, i appreciate it. 

i just wish i knew what to do, what is right for everyone. i'm pretty sure at this point what's best for my wife is a divorce. we've been separated a month or so already, and every time she visits or we try to patch things up we have a fucking blow out the next day. i feel like i'm busting ass without appreciation and she feels like i'm not trying at all. but everything else... it just feels like it would be better for everyone if i just disappeared. is it better to break a 3 year olds heart and hope she'll get over it, or hope that in 15 years she doesn't tell me she hates me as much as her mother does and wishes the courts hadn't made her see me? both options make me die inside, and the only thing i know for sure is that i can't die on the outside.

Although these are the stereotypical notions.

**Depression asks to be hidden from the world so it can thrive inside you.** “My life is good, I don’t need to get help.” “If I tell my family they will start to worry about me.” “If I tell my colleagues they will look down on me.” “Feeling sad makes me special, it’s my little sad secret.” That last one is extra tricky with a self-loathing undertone.

**Depression wants something bad to happen (to yourself or others) so your tears can be justified.** Because panic attacks while driving home from work make you want to drive off the edge of a cliff. Then the pain will stop. *But maybe I shouldn’t die just yet.*

**Depression is procrastinating.** Staying up all night watching youtube videos to fill your mind with brain garbage, which is always a better alternative to your natural train of thought.

**Depression is a bully**. “You’re weak. You’re gaining weight, you’re eating your feelings, you can’t even stick to an easy workout routine for more than a week. You’re stuck here now forever.” *Side note: how can a depressed person gather enough will power to exercise when all their energy is devoted to keeping themselves afloat?*

I like to think that I have a happy version of myself fighting to get out. After all, it’s been over 15 years  and I haven’t done any serious self-harm. And I do have moments of bliss and joy. But Depression has grown strong, it knows me better than I know myself, and it knows that no matter how many self-help books I read, and no matter what prescription I go on and off, it’ll find the perfect opportunity to take me down again and again. 

Maybe this is the way it’s going to be forever. I’ve gone to therapy (for as long as my insurance covered: a whole 3 sessions per year), I’ve been on prescriptions, I’ve made a virtually stress free environment for myself… I have many tools I can use to bring me off the edge of psychotic breakdown. So maybe I can live with that. Maybe identifying Depression as a beast will help separate myself from it. *(Although I feel like my “self” is slipping away rapidly.

I have been hospitalized 3 times this year and almost a fourth time following a recent incident. 

I had a child this year and he is the most amazing little boy. He has unlocked a side of me I never knew was there. His mother is a wonderful person too and I have caused her a lot of pain as well. I'm ashamed to even recall some moments I've had with her. They are just inexcusable and sometimes I wonder if demons (or something equivalent to them) are real and if I have been a host to one.

This last incident was after my third hospitalization. I had come home to live with my parents which is where my son's mother also lives (tough situation) but we were doing so well. We had been communicating and I finally felt like I might have an intact family again. We went on a goodwill date, we kissed, I told her i loved her whenever I felt it was proper, but she wouldn't say it back. I do not blame her for this. She probably never will love me again. That is my problem to deal with. 

So, one day im at home with my two sisters and something goes off in my head. I start feeling useless and like a burden to everyone. My family is afraid of me because of the things they have seen me do. I have cut my arm wide open in a frenzy a few months back. I attempted to kill myself multiple times this year, all of the incidents following an intense debate with myself about my place in this world and if everyone would be better off if I was gone. I start having this internal debate and my mind finally got to a place where I said, ""okay, I have the guts now. DO IT before you lose your nerve and you're just a blithering whiny shell again."" So, I go to the medicine cabinet and pull out a bottle trazadone and a bottle of muscle relaxers and start taking them. They are huge pills. About 5 seconds into this, I indeed lose my nerve again and start having a violent panic attack. I scream for my sisters, who are in their rooms unsuspecting and then this battle begins...

I yell their names (I'll say Lucy and kacey for their names in this story) ""Lucy! Kacey! Please!! I need an ambulance! I'm dying!"" My heart is has fast as a mouse's footsteps and I'm losing feeling in my extremities. I hear their footsteps and I hear a door slam. ""Kacey! Lucy! I'm in here! I'm here! Please!"" My body is in full survivor mode. The back of my neck goes numb and my heart feels like a black hole in my throat. I am covered with pins and needles. ""Lucy?!"" No response. ""Please! God please!"" At this point I hear no one. Not a sound. I notice my fingers wont bend anymore and my vision is collected at a single point. ""Please help."" I finally said to god and then I blacked out. I woke up, still in full panic mode not knowing how much time had passed and was expecting an ambulance at any second. Surely they called someone. Are they hiding? I hear a car door slam. ""I'm in here!"" I yelled right before puking all over the place. My body is covered in cold sweat. My fingers still won't move and I see the sweat marks on the couch under me and I puke again. I hear someone come through the door. ""In here!"" I said faintly. A man walks through the door frame and I see its my father. ""What the fuck is going on?!"" Lucy and Kacey are at the neighbors house freaking out! What are you sick?! Why are you telling?"" I told him I took an overdose right before puking again. Chalky white pieces of pills in a clear liquid all over the floor like a glacier broken off in the ocean. ""I guess we have to call the hospital, son!"" I said to him please don't. I dont want to go back. He said,""then you tell them you are sick and thats it and shut the fuck up if you dont want to go back to the hospital!"" I agreed and promptly passed out again. I woke up in my dad's bed. I had no memory of getting there.

People were confused. My girlfriend just thought I had had too much to drink and was being dramatic. My brother thought so too. I heard them talking as I woke up.

I walked into the living room and said, ""not cool, guys"" to my sisters. ""I needed an ambulance. I thought I was dying."" They apologized. I went back to bed.

I slept most of the next day and when I woke up my son's mother was giving me sideways glances and I was feeling very upset. I felt like my family were so scared of me that they wouldn't even callhelp when I needed it. I was hurt and embarrassed. I confronted her about the looks and she says she wasnt doing anything and my family was getting ready to leave to go shopping. So I said, ""Look everyone ive been feeling really bad lately and I feel like im getting on everyone's nerves! What is going on? She (pointing at my sons mom) is giving me bad looks all day and I went through tge scariest episode in my life yesterday! Why is everyone acting this way?"" 

My mom said that everyone is afraid of me. She was trying to find a place for my sisters to live and so was my son and his mother. They all wanted away from me. ""I'll save you all a lot of trouble."" I said and walked to my truck.

I got in and I hear my mom say Lucy is going to call the cops if I leave and tell them im going to hurt myself. I didn't care. I was taking all of my hurt and confusion and I was leaving. I had planned to hang myself, but I didnt tell anyone that. 

I soon realized after I left that i left everything at home. My phone, my wallet. I didn't have supplies to go through with this so I waited a few hours and drove back home. Everyone was gone. The house was locked up. I try every door and realize at this point I never really planned on killing myself. Why was I back here if I did. Why would I need my phone or my wallet? Just fucking do it already you whiny piece of shit.

I hear a door open. Its my dad. I say I have no gas or anything and I have no where to go. He says; ""you can't stay here."" And extends a $20 bill. Take what you need and don't come back. I did.

I slept in my truck cab for two days and now I'm at my grandfather's house and last I heard, I'm still not welcome.

I kbow that this is my fault. But I am more alone than I have ever been. I dont want to reach that place where all I can do IS follow through with my plans to die...

Can anyone offer me advice?

DO IT before you lose your nerve and you&amp;#39;re just a blithering whiny shell again.&amp;quot; So, I go to the medicine cabinet and pull out a bottle trazadone and a bottle of muscle relaxers and start taking them. They are huge pills. About 5 seconds into this, I indeed lose my nerve again and start having a violent panic attack. I scream for my sisters, who are in their rooms unsuspecting and then this battle begins...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I yell their names (I&amp;#39;ll say Lucy and kacey for their names in this story) &amp;quot;Lucy! Kacey! Please!! I need an ambulance! I&amp;#39;m dying!&amp;quot; My heart is has fast as a mouse&amp;#39;s footsteps and I&amp;#39;m losing feeling in my extremities. I hear their footsteps and I hear a door slam. &amp;quot;Kacey! Lucy! I&amp;#39;m in here! I&amp;#39;m here! Please!&amp;quot; My body is in full survivor mode. The back of my neck goes numb and my heart feels like a black hole in my throat. I am covered with pins and needles. &amp;quot;Lucy?!&amp;quot; No response. &amp;quot;Please! God please!&amp;quot; At this point I hear no one. Not a sound. I notice my fingers wont bend anymore and my vision is collected at a single point. &amp;quot;Please help.&amp;quot; I finally said to god and then I blacked out. I woke up, still in full panic mode not knowing how much time had passed and was expecting an ambulance at any second. Surely they called someone. Are they hiding? I hear a car door slam. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m in here!&amp;quot; I yelled right before puking all over the place. My body is covered in cold sweat. My fingers still won&amp;#39;t move and I see the sweat marks on the couch under me and I puke again. I hear someone come through the door. &amp;quot;In here!&amp;quot; I said faintly. A man walks through the door frame and I see its my father. &amp;quot;What the fuck is going on?!&amp;quot; Lucy and Kacey are at the neighbors house freaking out! What are you sick?! Why are you telling?&amp;quot; I told him I took an overdose right before puking again. Chalky white pieces of pills in a clear liquid all over the floor like a glacier broken off in the ocean. &amp;quot;I guess we have to call the hospital, son!&amp;quot; I said to him please don&amp;#39;t. I dont want to go back. He said,&amp;quot;then you tell them you are sick and thats it and shut the fuck up if you dont want to go back to the hospital!&amp;quot; I agreed and promptly passed out again. I woke up in my dad&amp;#39;s bed. I had no memory of getting there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People were confused. My girlfriend just thought I had had too much to drink and was being dramatic. My brother thought so too. I heard them talking as I woke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked into the living room and said, &amp;quot;not cool, guys&amp;quot; to my sisters. &amp;quot;I needed an ambulance. I thought I was dying.&amp;quot; They apologized. I went back to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept most of the next day and when I woke up my son&amp;#39;s mother was giving me sideways glances and I was feeling very upset. I felt like my family were so scared of me that they wouldn&amp;#39;t even callhelp when I needed it. I was hurt and embarrassed. I confronted her about the looks and she says she wasnt doing anything and my family was getting ready to leave to go shopping. So I said, &amp;quot;Look everyone ive been feeling really bad lately and I feel like im getting on everyone&amp;#39;s nerves! What is going on? She (pointing at my sons mom) is giving me bad looks all day and I went through tge scariest episode in my life yesterday! Why is everyone acting this way?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom said that everyone is afraid of me. She was trying to find a place for my sisters to live and so was my son and his mother. They all wanted away from me. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll save you all a lot of trouble.&amp;quot; I said and walked to my truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got in and I hear my mom say Lucy is going to call the cops if I leave and tell them im going to hurt myself. I didn&amp;#39;t care. I was taking all of my hurt and confusion and I was leaving. I had planned to hang myself, but I didnt tell anyone that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon realized after I left that i left everything at home. My phone, my wallet. I didn&amp;#39;t have supplies to go through with this so I waited a few hours and drove back home. Everyone was gone. The house was locked up. I try every door and realize at this point I never really planned on killing myself. Why was I back here if I did. Why would I need my phone or my wallet? Just fucking do it already you whiny piece of shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear a door open. Its my dad. I say I have no gas or anything and I have no where to go. He says; &amp;quot;you can&amp;#39;t stay here.&amp;quot; And extends a $20 bill. Take what you need and don&amp;#39;t come back. I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept in my truck cab for two days and now I&amp;#39;m at my grandfather&amp;#39;s house and last I heard, I&amp;#39;m still not welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kbow that this is my fault. But I am more alone than I have ever been. I dont want to reach that place where all I can do IS follow through with my plans to die...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone offer me advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have therapy appointments in two days. I am getting help, but what about everything else?&lt;/p&gt;

So yep. Now again I deal with the hell of  withdrawals from the old med and new side effects from the new one. Best of all, it probably won't work anyway. They're gonna pull another one out of a hat since this is all random trial and error anyway and give it to me, I suffer for a few weeks, then come back for #8. Ad nauseum.

So I'll just try to do my best.

Growing up I always felt alone. But i just recently realized how alone i was.

I was always my mothers least favorite and I knew this. The most evident case was when my little brother broke our baby grand piano and my mom beat the shit out of me for it. Then my little brother (feeling bad) admitted that it was him, and my mother bought him a brand new gameboy ""for being honest"". And he never got hit over that incident.

It was a cycle of stuff like this. In the summer I wasnt allowed out until I finished ""mommy school"". ""mommy school"" was upwards of 4 hours of summer classes issued by my mother and we had to finish whatever work she decided was necessary for us before we could go outside. When my brother got a question wrong my mom would comfort him and try to teach him how to do the thing better. I distinctly remember spelling a word wrong and getting hit with a flying dictionary before I could even apologize for being such a fucking moron. 

The cycle of violence continued thru my adolescence and stopped when I hit puberty around 13 years old. This cycle effected my entire life. I couldnt socialize because of her. Example... I pushed one of my neighbors down the driveway on her razor scooter(because she asked me to so she could go ""as fast as me"") and she fell. Well my mom used to sit in our garage with the door open chain smoking cigarettes just watching me play. As soon as she saw the girl hit the floor I heard an all too familiar screech ""DUBJANKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE NOW"". That was the worst beating I can ever remember. She was screaming in my face, her entire face was red as a cherry, spit was flying, (at the time I couldnt have been older than 5-6 because I remember being about mid thigh height) and she kept screaming DO YOU LIKE BEING PUSHED while she threw me into the wall over and over and over while hitting me with a wooden pasta spoon anywhere she could. I was smart enough to know to protect my face but there was nothing I could do to stop my entire body from being thrown around. When she finally calmed down I limped down the street and brought ""the girl"" back to my mom to explain what had happened. I thought that things were getting better until the girl left and my mom locked the garage door before coming in the house. I knew shit was going to go down. She didnt appologize. She screamed in my face HOW DARE YOU EMBARRASS ME LIKE THAT, \*ding ding round two\*. Once that subsided I was allowed to go to my room where i proceeded to cry my fucking eyes out. Until I heard a knock on my door and \*ding ding round three\* I had the distinct pleasure of hearing for the first time in my life ""YOU WANNA CRY, ILL GIVE YOU A FUCKING REASON TO CRY"". So that round stopped after a few minutes because thank god my father came home. 

My mother made me feel so estranged from my father that I felt bad asking him for a ride to a friends house, or even just to talk. She always said ""dont you dare bother your father hes very busy. It was just her way of keeping me from telling on her for hitting me. 

I have an older brother. And he was my hero, (oh ill explain why in a few paragraphs) because he was the only human in the entire world to interfere with a beating. He was sleeping, and he heard the commotion downstairs. I dont think ive ever heard anyone come down the stairs that quickly in my entire fucking life. And right as i looked down to avoid getting hit in the face the hit never came. I looked up and there he was, in all his glory, my big bro bro. The absolute gem grabbed the pasta spoon mid swing and he screamed at her something along the lines of you might have done that shit to me but ill be damned if you ever do it to him. And we hopped in his jeep wrangler (doorless) and he sped away with me in a baby seat. Unfortunately on the way to his friends house we made a sharp left turn and I dont think my brother buckled me in properly (or the seatbelts were faulty like he said) and my entire baby seat came out of the car and I hit the ground and rolled (it wasnt so bad it was only like 20 mph give or take) And from my toes to my knees the skin was just gone, I had some minor scratches on my arms and face but the majority of the damage was to the legs. So my brother rushed me home and my mom just put me in the bath tub and scrubbed the gravel out. And they put me to bed, and within 5 minutes my brother came home with the most toys that I have ever seen in my entire life. I got my very own ninja turtles and a buzz lightyear and some batman figurines. I was surprisingly happy about the whole incident.

fast forward to my late teens I would always talk about the aforementioned story any time i ever saw my big brother because it was one of the happiest moments of my life. even if i got a beating that day, and fell out of a car. I was just happy that someone cared about me. But my brother had to go ahead and ruin that by saying ""are you that fucking stupid that you think i would actually buy you toys, and that i would buy them that fast? those are just the toys mom had around the house to shut you the fuck up when you wouldnt stop crying"". well ok then buddy memory ruined.

I was never allowed to have a childhood, my entire childhood I was forced to swim for multiple teams (2-3 teams per season \[yes thats per season and no im not lying\]) because of this I never got to make any friends because anyone i met during school i could never see after. So during this period of swimming at around age 12 a coach tried to rape me and i beat his ass in the locker room. It was mid winter and i ran out of the facility into the street and straight into oncoming traffic. Thank god a soccer mom in her soccer mom mini van saw me. I had cuts on my chest, was visibly crying, and was soaking wet in a speedo. She took me into her car, asked what happened, covered me in a coat and IMMEDIATELY called the police. Within 2 minutes and im not joking it was the best response time ive ever seen. Rambo pulls up, this cop couldnt have been a more muscular guy if he was doing steroids every day since birth. Absolutely brollick. He runs up to the car, takes one look at me and says ""who did it"" and i tell him its jim, jim did it. He runs inside and in 3 or so minutes he came back out with a new breifcase. And by breifcase i mean my swim coach. He cuffed his hands behind his back. cuffed his ankles and cuffed the ankles and hands together with 3 sets of cuffs. He walked out with jim crying like the little bitch he was that his circulation was being cut off and bla bla bla. He opens the police cruiser door and throws that little bitch against the door. Within a few minutes my mom comes to the scene and sees whats going on and tells the officer to immediately let jim out of the car. My mom insisted that it had to be my fault and that jim would never do this if it wasnt my fault. to this day she tells me that she saw a car with a broken window and she thought i smashed jims window and jim beat me up because of that. Nobody i know ever saw a broken window, not even the cop when i came back a year later to decide if i wanted to press charges. I didnt want to press charges, i had just hit puberty, so i wanted to get a sanctioned boxing match against jim so i could kill him and get away with it. the officer informed me that regrettably i could not do that. So i didnt press charges.

My mother always used to tell me that if i was ever drinking and needed help to call her. So when i was about 16 i got drunk and called my mom to pick me up. Right before she got there the police arrived as well. She walked thru them and came to get me and started screaming arrest this motherfucker and all this shit infront of my entire class. it was so embarassing. That was the night i told her i wanted to kill myself. She told me to go to bed and called a shrink that was retiring in 2 weeks. The shrink gave me every single sample he had of anti depressants, coupled with literally no therapy, we just used to play with his guns and then he would let me leave. So I just got 1000s of free anti depressants but thats not a good thing. I have rapid cycling manic depression. They make me go hyper manic. 

So eventually things die down but im still alone. Because of how i acted as a person (i had no self awareness and no introspection at all) and because of how my mother was I was entirely unable to make a real friend. Everyone that I was friends with invited me out so they could laugh behind my back and use me for my money. I started landscaping at 12 because i needed money. I was always known as the lazy child though. anywho. You know how they say if youre not in a group chat thats because the group chat is talking about you. Well i've never been in a group chat my entire life. Ive also never been invited to a party. Ive also never had a best friend. Ive had a series of girlfriends that were just more and more like my mother. Until i met my most recent girlfriend, we'll call her D. HI D SORRY YOURE ON THE COUCH AND IM BEING WEIRD ON REDDIT. So up until D I never had a friend. Being with this woman has shown me what an actual friend is like. What being comfortable is like. And its nice. Well thats alie. my dads always been my best friend. He's really the only person who ever wanted to hang out with me. He would take me kayaking and golfing and to baseball games. Its really dope. Im 28 and we still chill on the regular. without him i would have undoubtedly killed myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like im rambling. Im sorry guys. I dont really know how to properly express my deep sadness. 

&amp;#x200B;

What i was trying to get at is that just because someones cis-gendered, and white, and middle class, and decent looking doesnt mean their problems are invalid. My entire life my ability to feel sad has been socially invalidated because of those 4 qualities i have. Thats unfair and i don't appreciate it. Everyones problems are relative. Everyone has a best and a worst moment and no one gets the right to tell you dont.

EG: if your entire life is perfect and nothing bad ever happens to you until one day you step on a lego and it really really hurts. And you keep telling everyone how much it hurts and how its effecting you and no one listens. Well i hear you, and i really am sorry that you had to go through that. You just experienced your worst moment and you're still here. What can i do to help you. do you wanna go for a walk? do you want to talk about it? wanna just watch tv and forget about it? Count me in. The only problem is you cant count me in, because you dont talk to me and youve always made fun of me. But hey, despite everything, id still be here to talk to you if you wanted, you just choose not to talk to me.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I'm an emotional mess who cant express himself and I'm just now at 28 learning how to deal with life. It's never too late. If you refuse to accept failure as an option you will eventually succeed. I'm 28 and 2 years ago I was homeless because my mom kicked me out because and i quote ""if youre a fag i will never love you"". Well im not a whole fag, just half of one #bi. But in those 2 years since losing everything, I have found myself. And i never thought i would. I still dont have a job, but im in school. I only have two friends, but thats way more than i had before, ones my dad and the others my girlfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Idk im just sad and wana vent. I wish i could do it better. But eventually i'll get some closure or i'll just pop like a balloon filled with too much vapid bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone wants to talk, I'm down. Maybe we could start a reddit group chat so we can all help  eachother and just have some good vibes and good times.

&amp;#x200B;

I love u reddit, you're like the best friend i always dreamed of. If reddit could give actual hugs it would be a perfect place. But i guess pobodys nerfect.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont know how to start this. So I&amp;#39;ll just try to do my best.&lt;/p&gt;

My first time here and writing. 

This is something over been struggling with for the last 10-15 years and with my [30F] birthday coming up on Saturday (and still no set plans) I thought I'd ask y'all. 

Does anyone else ever feel that your friends don't value you? That even though you're a kick ass person and friend, you never seem to be invited anywhere. Friends dont seem to hit you up in the evenings or weekends. 

To make matters worse, my therapist (who ghosted me this summer) said that I rely too much on my friends for validation and should be comfortable doing things on my own.  I understand where she is coming from (I believe that I am ((can be)) strong and confident and know how to do things alone) except this isnt a once in a while problem, it is a weekly struggle for me. I haven't been invited out or had weekend plans in months.

So without trying to look too desperate, I try to make plans with friends, any of my friends.  For after work today, in a few days from now, this weekend,  next weekend........ I literally just end up asking, ""when are You free to hang?"" Because like clockwork, everyone I know is always busy.                     It baffles my mind. 


A few weeks ago, I reached out to about 45+ of my friends to see who would be available to celebrate with me. 5. 5 people are able to join.  And while I really do appreciate those 5 friends coming to help me celebrate my big 3-0..... does anyone else see or feel where I'm coming from?

We have been together almost 2 years. 

Sunday afternoon she said she needed time to think if she’s happy. She claims I have done nothing wrong. I asked when she will be back. She said she wasn’t sure if it would be a day, week or month. I asked if we were still together and we would remain loyal and no dating or anything of the sorts. She agreed. She left and I was in agony. I felt like the world was collapsing in. I got a text the next day while I was at work saying she was at the apartment. I rushed home and held her. We get to talking asking about if things have improved. She told me she went to a friends house, and then to a co workers house. (She has no close friends). She got drunk at the co workers house and slept with him. I find out and lose it. We eventually calm down and I say that I’m willing to forgive her and if she’s willing to go to couples therapy. She agreed instantly and we just held each other. 

Today as I woke up and finding some therapy locations she came out and said that she’s still not sure if she’s happy. She said we have (had) a perfect life with perfect pets, location etc. but she’s not happy where she is. I then told her what do we do? After lots of talking she is unsure if she still loves me and wants to take time to think about it. In 2 weeks she’s going to let me know if she still has feelings and if I do. 

Right now I have feelings and want to get back together. But my brain tells me that I shouldn’t do it. I’m scared alone and living with a friend at the moment. Any advice is welcome.

First, sorry for the sloppy style, english is not my mother tongue.

I remember when I was younger about elementary age I remember feeling that happiness was always harder for me then the other kids. Later on in life at about highschool I always had some sort of numbness emotion wise and I realized that I had started to drift away from people in general. I never really questioned this until now. I'm a freshman in college now and I think I've hit a breaking point. I'm immensely unsatisfied with the state my life is in but I would never think about it to hard or talk to people about it. All through high school to now I  just lied to everyone and kept smiling and cracking jokes. A couple of weeks ago I woke up in a horrible mood buried under the stress of school and the inadequacies of my life. I had always thought suicide was stupid and if you commit it that you were selfish. I thought I would never amount to doing such a thing. But for that entire day ending my life was all I could think about. I had a hard time thinking and breathing all day I might as well not have gone to class that day and when I got off of the train to head home I looked at the train tracks and I remember saying in my head ""this could be it"". I quickly snapped out of it and walked home. I haven't told anyone about these thoughts and I still have them occasionally and it all culminated to today where I found myself crying into school notes debating on whether to end it or not. I wish I wasn't born. I would kill myself but I would hate knowing the effect it would have on those who care about me.

I'm autistic. I was taken out of high school for issues I had with the environment and how it negatively affected me—I didn't say a word to anyone anymore, I skipped frequently, ran away from home hoping someone would kill me or take me away. After I was taken out, it was nice at first because I could just do my schoolwork in peace and play videogames for the rest of day, everyday, all day. Eventually, even though I was in an environment that better suited me, I was still depressed and hopeless about my future and still hated myself for being different from everyone else. I had no doubt that I was going to kill myself eventually one day in the near future with how things were. At that point, I'd been locked in my room for around 2 years, and hadn't been outside in around 2 years. I was nothing less than miserable and ready to call it quits.

But, I somehow kept myself distracted on videogames long enough that another 2 years had passed. I was still miserable, but I was alive. I was 17 at that point and knew I was hurdling towards adulthood. I knew I had zero skills of any kind, I knew I was socially inept in every regard, and I knew I still had no clue on what I wanted from life, so again, I was planning on killing myself before I turned 18 with a mindset of, ""This world isn't made for people like me,"" and, ""I'd make it nowhere if I couldn't communicate."" Although, amidst all that frustration and confusion, after a meltdown where I broke some things, I just got an idea from nowhere.

I had literally nothing to lose but my sanity, so I pursued it and started writing my idea. And I wrote, and wrote, and wrote, and wrote all the way through 2018 without noticing. Around late 2018, I realized that writing actually made me feel good and it was something I was good at. I had found a purpose to live and a goal to chase. That was the thing I was missing my entire life and it was now right in front of me. I'd been dead for so long, just cruising by along the river of life, and I'd finally gotten a hint of what it felt like to be alive. I didn't want it to fizzle out.

Fast forward to now, and I've written my first fantasy novel coming to 260k words. I'm working on a sequel to the first and a standalone on the side as of this moment. But then it came back to me that I was going to spend my life in this room. I don't want to spend my life in this room. I want to experience things my own way and not be restricted to these four walls for forever. Then, I was back to wondering what was the point in writing, just so it could rot in this room alongside me, and not bring others as much joy and excitement as it's brought me in writing it. I want to live so badly, but at the same time, I don't if this is what my life will be.

I asked my mother to let me see a doctor so I could get help and maybe get to a point where I can function enough to exist in the outside world, but it doesn't seem like she's on board. At first, she said I'd see one in September, then it was pushed back to October, and now October's almost over and I'm still sitting in the same spot I've been in the last five years. I can't do anything on my own because I'm powerless and have nothing. Again, I'm back to thinking I guess I'm killing myself after all. And this time it feels like the end. Like I'm aiming a gun at my own head and waiting to pull the trigger. Why should I keep jumping through hoops and trying to better myself, when I always end right back where I started, feeling the same as I've always felt. I don't want to go without saying I fought my hardest, so after October passes, I'm going to have myself put into a psych ward, but I'm also afraid that will result in nothing, and then I'll really have to kill myself and it'll be over. I'll be dead and have never known what it meant to be alive.

Anyways, I’m five years older.

Thankfully, my watcher (I think that’s what they’re called?) from the time I was in the hospital told me if I wanted to get out of being sent to a mental institution was to say I was just stressed out and that I accidentally took one too many caffeine pills. So I did and the attempt wasn’t put on my permanent record. Had to regain my parents trust. But the ‘friends’ I had at the time didn’t really care what happened. Woohoo. Started community college near home, got a 4.0 that semester, moved to a different city, transferred to a ‘better’ uni, put myself out there more, kicked the antidepressant addiction, joined a fraternity, made a solid group of friends, gained a dependence to weed and alcohol, worked in multiple labs during the summer, and when I graduated, I traveled to the country I wanted to see the most and kicked the weed and alcohol dependence. Got a job after working as a cashier at a Walgreens, then got a tech position at my old uni that I transferred out of, quit that, signed up to teach abroad, left after a day due to a mental breakdown and now here I am. Great right? Yea, I did what everyone said and now I’m in the same position. Exercising and being active? I lost 20 lbs in the last three months and still don’t feel better about myself. Just texted the ex I broke up with a few weeks before going abroad to teach. No reply, not that she’s entitled to reply.

Friends still think I’m in another country because I can’t work up the nerve to tell them that I’m a coward. Going to tell them that I came back soon because of issues with the school.

Here is the States, meds are by-prescription only.  You have to get through a psychiatrist in many cases.  Regular physicians often don't want to touch psychiatric issues.

But call any medical professional in the States and say you are a new patient.  You will be asked to wait a month or more for a first visit.  Psychiatrists are a real minority of medical doctors.

So, you're depressed/anxious and suicidal.  Medications keep you from killing yourself. But you can't get a visit to get a  prescription for a month or longer.

I'm currently in a position where the shrink I was visiting just disappeared.  No response for appointments, no answer from phone.  Shrink was part of a ""service"" that claims you can get online visits with your health insurance, which I'm lucky enough to have insurance.  It's crappy insurance, but in this ""great"" country, I'm lucky to have it.  

So I start looking for another shrink.  There's *two* that are listed - for the entire US!  I call the service, and they won't confirm or deny that they only offer two shrinks (when I started several months ago, they had about 20).  Both of the two shrinks tell me they aren't taking any new appointments - probably because they are overworked?  I mean there's only two of them, and 50 million depressed people.

So I find a different online service.  They also only have two shrinks.  For the entire effin' country!  I call the service, they won't deny or confirm that they only have two psychiatrists, and tell me I can only schedule online.

Where are all the shrinks?  Do I go to the ER, just to ask for a refill of my anti-depressants?

It breaks my heart because he really is a great guy, he's smart and a number of people who have met him after hearing the story of my 32 year old brother who doesn't do anything are shocked when meeting him, they say he isn't what they were imagining. That being said he does lack social skills, sometimes taking him out in public is like watching someone who just spent 20 years in jail.

For the longest time it has been lip service from everyone in my family including myself that we are going to help him. Offer to take him driving or saying we should step in. My Mom is enabling him into doing this as she really is just a sweet lady but she can't stand up to it and my Dad has given up. About once a year him and my dad get in a huge fight, he's kicked out but it always blows over. 

 Well he turns 33 in a month and our family including our extended family has gotten together and are coming up with a plan for an intervention. 

Just wondering if anyone has went through this before. I know hes embarrassed of the life he lives. I don't want this to be an embarrassing thing for him. I want him to feel like he has got support moving forward but at the same time enough is enough.

I live in Canada and mental health is free in our area. Our plan right now is to sit him down and say that we care about him but it's time that he gets moving with his life. There is a walk-in mental health clinic in our city, I have contacted them and they advised that someone will be able to speak with him if he comes in. From there they can refer to a more specialised path. So After we sit him down we have agreed that I or someone else is going to drive him to the clinic and start this. From there hopefully he gets a psychiatrist or a therapist and we can work with them on getting him into society.

When I was in elementary school, I was the weird quiet kid to everyone, even adults. People would talk about me behind my back, exclude me from activities, and move to a different lunch table when I tried to sit down to eat with them, leaving me alone. I was the kid that nobody wanted for a group project, leaving me to work by myself. 

“Stop being so happy all the time. It’s weird.” 

“Look at the weirdo sitting by herself.""

“Does anyone want to be in depressedgirl1998s group for the project?” \*crickets\*

I stopped trying to talk to people. I shut people out at a very young age and slowly began closing myself off from the rest of the world.

'Nobody cares.'

'You’re all alone.'

‘Why are you even still here?'

I still isolated myself to the back of the classroom because I had grown so accustomed to the way things were at my old school, where nobody cared. I only spoke when a teacher called on me, but I never raised my hand out of fear of saying the wrong thing, even when I knew the answer. I would just sit in the back, and escape into my mind, writing stories to help me escape. 

One day, a new girl joined the class. I decided to try and finally make a friend, and figured the new girl, who didn’t know that I was the subject of everybody’s ridicule, was my best option. For months, we talked and grew closer. I felt like I finally wouldn’t be alone anymore. 

Soon, her birthday came. I helped her plan it out and design the cards. The next day, she brought them in and passed them out. To everyone but me. I asked her if I was invited to the party. 

“Why would you be invited? You’re a worthless nobody with no friends. I wouldn’t invite you if you were the last person on earth.""

As I watched her walk out the door, I felt as if my heart had been blocked off. I didn’t feel sad, or angry. I just felt empty. 

‘Friends don’t exist.'

‘Everyone is a liar.'

‘Just kill yourself.'

High school came. I had stopped caring about anything a few years ago. I no longer felt any sense of emotion. I just felt like an empty husk walking around. I put on a fake smile when talking to family, but when I was alone, I broke down. Eight years of the same treatment really does something to a person mentally. I began wearing headphones all hours of the day, drowning out the sounds of the outside world with my music. I still sat in the back of the class, alone. I still wrote to escape. Overall, nothing really changed during those four years.

When I was 16, I got a car. Two years later, I got my license and my freedom. I began dog sitting for my grandmother when she was out of town. I would work and then drive for about 45 minutes to her house and spend the night there by myself, making sure her dogs were fed. The next day, I would do it all over again. 

One night, I got off work late. It was around 1am when I finally got in my car to drive to her house for the night. No-one was on the highway, so I pushed the gas pedal further down. I went faster and faster until I looked at the speedometer to see that I was going 110 m/h. I didn’t care though and went faster. I caught a glance of the median and imagined myself driving into it head on, at the speed I was going. I couldn’t bring myself to do it though, and slowed my car down to a safer speed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m 21 now. I still write to escape. I still wear headphones every second of the day that I’m not at work or sleeping. I still feel empty inside. I still have visions of a potential way to end my life (walking out into traffic, crashing my car, ODing, etc.)

I’m still alone and I’m still here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I remember growing up is being bullied and being alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in elementary school, I was the weird quiet kid to everyone, even adults. People would talk about me behind my back, exclude me from activities, and move to a different lunch table when I tried to sit down to eat with them, leaving me alone. I was the kid that nobody wanted for a group project, leaving me to work by myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stop being so happy all the time. It’s weird.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Look at the weirdo sitting by herself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Does anyone want to be in depressedgirl1998s group for the project?” *crickets*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped trying to talk to people. I shut people out at a very young age and slowly began closing myself off from the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Nobody cares.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;You’re all alone.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Why are you even still here?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

So I have talked to my therapist and my parents and told them that I now want to start exploring using medication. I know that it will take a while to get results and that it may take a while to get the dose right, but I don't want to be like this anymore. I want to be able to keep my head above water so I can do the work to stay better. Just wanted to share this as it is a big milestone in my journey.

Over the summer of my freshman year, my ""friends"" kicked me out of their suite and put someone else in it. I was hurt but was determined to not let that stop our friendship. I tried hard last year to stay in touch with them but they seemed to drift farther away. At that time my mental health definitely started to decline and i stopped putting in the effort. If they did not want to spend time with me i didn't want to spend time with them. (They also hinted that since i became depressed i wasn't as fun to be around, and they have no desire in being there for me during this time) I ended up spending most days in bed unless i was doing something. I'd still, study, go to the gym and call home, but besides that i just stayed in bed. I smoked almost everyday, not too cope or numb the pain but just to do something, i was bored. That being said it did help me with my plan, i tried to make every day so similar that it would feel like a blur, and it worked. Time honestly seemed to fly by and the next thing i knew it was summer.

Side note summer, winter vacations, breaks are all the best. I am happiest when i am home, with friends that care, with work to distract me. During these times i'm only sad at night when i'm alone.

Fast forward to junior year everything got worse. The year started off well, i tried to rekindle my friendships at school and it did seem to get better. I also had a single room and had signed up to study abroad (solo) in Amsterdam. I had peace in my room and i was excited to finally get away from my school next semester and discover Amsterdam on my own. I then learned that i would be getting a new roommate. He was moved in because he sexually assaulted someone in his last suite and rather than kick him out they placed him with me. He was horrible, drunk and belligerent every night, made my room a mess, stole my clothes and finally caused so much of a scene that the school kicked him out. I was told he wouldn't be coming back so i decided to splurge. Spent $100+ on new fixings for my room. Posters, sheets, etc to try to bring some life to the room. I was told last week that despite what i was told i would be getting a new roommate again. Not only would this throw off my single room, which was the one thing giving me happiness at school but i also had now wasted a lot of money. 

At this point i decided i would try to graduate early, i had a few AP credits and just needed two extra classes. I am doing a winter class and was told i could do an internship over the summer for credit. Today i was told that to do an internship even if i found it i would have to pay my school $2,000 to have it count as a class and that it might not even count since they prefer me to go for 8 semesters, i explained i was trying to leave this school as fast as possible and they said they'd get back to me.

In the meantime my relationships at school have all gone to shit (i have completely cut off ties with my friends, the purposefully exclude me now and i have heard them talk about how they wish i'd stop visiting them on multiple occasions now), I've been skipping meals and have already lost 15lbs (already a skinny guy), and im not doing great in classes. The only thing i have to look forward too is my study abroad and winter and summer break. Until then i feel like my situation is going to get worse and at this point everything feels like a waste. I'm killing myself with extra work and stress and might not even gain anything from it. I think i can handle one more semester but if i can't graduate early i don't know what i'm going to do.

I'm at a point where i feel like nothing i do matters and everyone is out to get me. I know this is a long rant so i hope it flows well but i've never posted here and feel like i just had to get this all out in the open.

From the beginning of my teenage years of 13 years, everything rotated around and turned into miserable shit that I have to suffer from every single day. Now I'm eightteen and shit hasn't changed from the tiniest bit. Fuck all of the scums who say ""everything will be better bro!"" ""just love yourself bro"" ""the right people and SO will come along just wait bro"". These are the kind of people who don't know what it's like to be depressed and destroyed to the ground. The repetitiveness of every single day, month and year just tires me out to the point I just can't take it anymore. I feel the hate. My loneliness. My anger. More and more as time passes that I can't be assed with to get outside anymore. I hate school and don't want to go there anymore even if it's my last year before graduation but I still force myself to see one big crowd of canned piss at one place.

I never used to had any true or loyal friends in my entire life reaching back to kindergarten times and that already sucked. I'm not a great conversationist to woo people into my direction but I'm not the weird nerd type either. No one visited my birthday parties, I never went out to play neither do activites with other kids. I was always the loner from the beginning of elementary to now who no one wanted to talk to. I for real cannot remember anything positive and memorable in my life other than slitting myself like a violin on new years eve at midnight and whimpering through the year how absolute shit my life is. Love life is non-existent. Girls laugh their asses off telling I look like 12 or 15 when I'm actually 18 as mentioned and my height (5'8/9) seems also too problematic for them since everyone of them is either tall as me or even more taller. Had only one long distance but it didn't last much and she lied and dated multiple men behind my back to ultimatively dumping me. Taking advice from people who say to wait for the right one will level you up to a age 40 virgin wizard if that's what you want. I find it unbelievable that the majority of people aren't redpilled and still live like in a Disney Dream World. Fuck relationships these days because I don't care anymore. I see no reason to get into romance with these emotionally driven children anymore. This school year I developed an unnecessary crush on a girl in my class which makes it even more depressing for me. I doubt she even likes me back but who the fuck would like me anyway? I never had a crush have mutual feelings and all I received was rejection from getting all my rejection-fearing shit together to confess to them. While the girls I have absolutely no interest to chase me down instead. I'm fairly attractive from ratings of people. Today was an extremely shit day and I felt so completely done, overwhelmed and couldn't concentrate at all. Couldn't answer the questions the teachers asked me in class and did everything wrong. She probably thought what an idiot am I so why give me attention?

Highschool is complete bullshittery. No one liked me there when I switched my school and came over to them. Survived half a year in there getting told into my face that no one likes me till at one point right before the end of the school year I got falsely accused out of nowhere as an school shooter from someone I don't know of. Some guys had spread false rumors about me being a school shooter which caused half the population of the school refusing to come the next day. Principal and teachers forced me to go apologize infront of the class for a believed lie about me. Told them to fuck off and got suspended from the school. Had to deal with cops, stuff went fine as I was innocent anyways, the dickheads got busted out instead, but for the cost of my reputation my entire city hates me now and spits on me wherever I walk. I'm also not allowed to enter the area around their school anymore. No true friends, no support, nothing but only hate filled text messages I receive from random people time to time. Someone came one night over to the entrance door to my apartment and destroyed it by throwing rocks and bashing on it. All the 4 people who told me they're here back in the days I used to talk to vanished from me and pretend I don't exist anymore. There you go, true friends we can call that. I was so over by that point I tried to commit suicide three times in a row on the following new year on midnight. Failed all of them and instead had some retarded johaniters call me on phone to try to assign me to their sanatorium. By the way in my country showing any history of issues like these and you're guaranted to have no career lol. I'm fine in school and my grades are okay and aren't affected by my issues.  So I talked my way out of them and continued to live like always. I wish I could have had a gun on that moment.  It would make the work so much easier just thinking about it. Then I finally wouldn't be here anymore but only a flying spirit wandering this depressing world over the clouds.

Fast forwarding one year later to today and shit still isn't anything worth. On the other side stuff has calmed down and I get ignored and disliked by the entire population in my city. Living a normal gray normie life though filled with loneliness, sadness, being alone and without any motivation. Literally zero people in my life. I never talk. Family is the typical eastern european toxic family that doesn't have depression in their dictionary. My parents mocks me why I still don't have a girlfriend at my age and mum tries to transform me into a complete beta by telling me to be Mr. NiceGuy on a whole new level to girls. Shoving toxic masculinity onto me is also okay for her. She doesn't want to understand today's females and thinks we're still here in the 80s. I don't spend any time with my family and go on my own instead since I feel too mentally drained around them. I like to be alone and not bothered by them.

I don't need hobbies as I'm oversupplied on them already. I'm a boxer, I workout, I code, I rap and sing, I'm a gamer and use video games to temporarily numb my feelings. There's more but fuck that. I lost motivation to do anything for the past three months but slowly returned to it again to not feel like a complete loser. I still don't enjoy life. I never got to enjoy my teenage years. I never got to experience fun and have a adventurous life with other teenagers. I never got anything of that. Hell I barely ever reached a peak of 2 people who I would talk to sometimes in school. Though they pretended like I didn't exist outside of the classroom.

The only social interaction I have in my life is e-mail penpalling which I discovered back in 2017 to make up for the emptiness in my soul. I fed off from them to keep me internally alive but not a while ago I don't feel like doing that anymore. The majority of them left and only a few besties of 1 year are holding on onto me. Funny how internet people are better to make friends with.

That's it. I'm done with venting random shit on here because our reputation got ruined by cutting attention whores flexing their scars to everyone in the classroom and white girls who find it trendy to have a mental illness so there's no one to vent to. I never unbottled my feelings to anyone or showed any signs of sadness just to have unnecessary asshats off my back that I don't need.

Afterall. Fuck all of this. I see no brightness in my future anymore. I'm destined to be alone for the rest of my life and follow the same routine in my day while listening to an endless loop of the same $UICIDEBOY$ songs. I'm made to be starved.

I had no faith in anything but I finally found a reason to be faithful it literally hit me like a ton of bricks and everything changed I am just so happy simple as that and I just do not see things changing anytime soon for me I don&amp;#39;t know how it happened but the fact that someone as lost as me can have an unexpected life altering experience and just feel so much better overall and just feel so great in less than 24 hours it happened believe it don&amp;#39;t believe it in 24 hours my entire mindset shifted from fuck the world fuck my life kill me now to holy fuck life is the single greatest thing that has ever happened to me! You don&amp;#39;t know me, you don&amp;#39;t know just how fucking far gone I was and there is just one simple truth anything is possible how could it not be? The fact that someone as lost as this mother fucking piece of trash can flip a switch he didn&amp;#39;t know existed than that means it can happen to you as well. I know it sounds cliche as fuck but the power of belief is so much stronger than we realize. I thought there was no hope I thought there was no way it could get better I was wrong and I so not give a fuck what kind of life you live, if you feel this way too YOU ARE WRONG YOU ARE WRONG YOU ARE FUCKING WRONG and never god damn forget it I love all of you I love everyone never attempt to kill yourself I am living proof that it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how bad it gets THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

I've always had ups and downs. Some down's lasted 2-3 days and some last weeks. Lately I have been feeling miserable again but this kind of takes over now and doesn't really stop. Until now, it always was like that I felt amazing on the ups and horrible on my down phases and at the moment I feel the worst I have ever felt. There is a constant feeling I can barely put into words. all I feel is anger, sadness, hopelessness and just sadness overall. On top of that down, I just moved out of my parents house into a bigger city (I had to due to me going to university) a good 1,5-2 hours drive away and I miss them like crazy, because I always had a good bond with my parents. In addition  to that and the down phase also comes the doubt and anxiety towards the path i'm taking. Currently I am studying at university in order to become a teacher and I have a lot of doubt about that. It's a cool thing to do but it's not the real deal to me. What I really wanna do is livestreaming but this is another story and a rather small reason to my constant bad moods and sadness.   
Today I even started tearing up in the bus just because I reflected my current situation and I just couldn't help myself and exited as soon as possible. I just cannot help myself and have more suicidal thoughts than ever, meanwhile thats bringing me down aswell because I cannot leave me family behind. i just hate everything and I just wanna sleep all day, stay in bed and not do anything...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;the title is pretty much self explaining..

I really do try to be civil, but, and I&amp;#39;m not blaming it all on you, you really aren&amp;#39;t making it easy. I just wish you would realize we both have issues that affected the downfall of our relationship. For my part, I am sorry. More sorry than you will ever know. I love you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With much love,&lt;/p&gt;

What makes life really worth living? Why is life good? Why is it beautiful? 

I personally find that life is one continuous shitstorm to be blunt about it. It's a constant struggle. More and more, I'm feeling like I want out.  Some can never answer me. Others flail around for an answer. Others look like a deer caught in headlights. They act as if I uncovered a lie they've been telling themselves.

But all they say to me is: ""Don't do it."", ""Don't give up."", or ""It'll get better.""

They act as if life is a cookie cutter. Their happiness/life situation is the same or will be the same for everyone else. That's blatantly false.

I've done things the right way, but nothing's progressed. Setback after setback. Every path I take leads back to square one. Even paths that seemed really promising. They say, ""Oh you're not trying hard enough."" or ""You don't need anyone to hold your hand."" One problem leads to the next. Some even acknowledge my troubles, but they still spout that foolishly optimistic nonsense.

""Take baby steps."" or ""One day at a time."" That's all I can do!

&lt;p&gt;What makes life really worth living? Why is life good? Why is it beautiful? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally find that life is one continuous shitstorm to be blunt about it. It&amp;#39;s a constant struggle. More and more, I&amp;#39;m feeling like I want out.  Some can never answer me. Others flail around for an answer. Others look like a deer caught in headlights. They act as if I uncovered a lie they&amp;#39;ve been telling themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all they say to me is: &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do it.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t give up.&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;ll get better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

I’m poly. I’m married. I have a girlfriend. My wife has no other partners. My girlfriend has 5. I have dysthymic depression and anxiety. I have no energy, no motivation, no drive. Recently this year I’ve had two seizures that doctors cannot figure out why. 

Since my two seizures... and maybe a little bit before... I haven’t been very intimate or touchy feely. My wife gets it. She has similar brain stuff. My girlfriend and I slowed down our intimacy this year. And completely dropped off after my seizures.

I went to my girlfriend’s partner’s birthday party. She is part of a triad with person J and M. We were having a good time. Getting high. Birthday stuff. All good. I noticed my girlfriend making out and getting hot n heavy with J. My high self kind of wanted to get in on that but it wasn’t that kind of party. I’m not sure if it was jealously.

Fast forward to today. I was catching up with my girlfriend and checking in about Sunday. I told her about how I may have felt jealously. And she said... “I’ve had to switch gears and really not focus on the physicality of our relationship. “

Then I realized... the only times I’ve been intimate this year with anyone is only when I’m high, drunk, or even with sexsomnia. Like a good 9/10 encounters. And that’s not just intimacy. I get high or drunk to have a better time. Otherwise I’ll just cry or want to go home.

Even if nobody reads this I think it will help for me to get it out there. 

I am someone who under normal circumstances suffers from depression and anxiety. And when my life isn’t on fire medication and some therapy keeps me more or less good. 

But like this year has just been too much. Just going to list all the things that have happened so far.

My wife and I just bought a house and since have been a little house poor. 

This February our Furnace died on a day when it was -15 F. We had to divert money we had saved for my wife’s maternity leave to pay for it to be fixed. 

Then we had plumbing issues to the time of 500 dollars. 

We then had our son which was wonderful and terrifying. My sleep evaporated - for a good cause but further exacerbated my mental health issues. 

After my paternity leave came the worst event. The day I returned from leave the owner of the small company I worked for told me he could no longer pay my salary. To my knowledge we had no money issues and I did not see this coming. This was my worst fear realized. Not going to lie. For that day I got home and collapsed on the floor a total wreck. 

I scraped myself up and got out there with vigor to get a job. Each rejection hurt more than it should have. Each week that goes by without landing a job I feel more and more useless. 

While driving 100 miles home from a free lance gig where I made some good money - the alternator on my relatively new car died leaving me stranded 80 miles from home. The tow home and repairs I personally did all but negated the money I earned. 

I then landed a temporary gig where again my car had issues. At least this time I had AAA and the tow wasn’t expensive. But I was stranded for many hours on a Friday I was going to go home early and relax. 

3 weeks after that I had a really good interview somewhere that could be just the break I was looking for. I was on the phone with my wife (both using hands free) telling her about how great the interview was when she was involved in a car accident. An F-150 plowed into the back of her car. I heard her scream and glass breaking. She did not respond to me. 30 seconds went by. I was frantic. I thought she had died. She then responded that she was ok abut needed to go. She had a major concussion whiplash and bruising all over her body. But she walked away.  That’s all I really cared about. 

This last week I was offered a really promising job with a great salary. I finally felt like things were taking a turn for the better. Yesterday they retracted the offer citing that they wanted to cut costs. 

So today. I’m just feeling defeated. I’ve been treated like garbage and had so many things happen that I don’t even feel like getting out of bed anymore. This is just the short version. There’s things I’m either missing or just not remembering. I just feel like so many shitty things have been happening I can’t imagine life ever going back to a happy place.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year has been one of the hardest in my life.

I think I'm a bit of a workaholic in that I'm pretty much always working on something ""productive"", and it's quite common for me to be working almost nonstop, even while eating and on the toilet and so forth, from the moment I wake up to the moment I crash into bed.

However, I'm not really a workaholic in terms of school or jobs - I'm still fairly ambitious (at a top school on a competitive course, going for a first and decent career, and also have a bad habit of agreeing to lots of extra shifts at my part-time jobs) and strive to do well, but I tend to do the minimum amount of work required to succeed therein, and don't like going above and beyond with work. Last year at university for example I literally got 70% overall to the nearest %, which is what you need for a first.

On the other hand, when it comes to personal projects and stuff like volunteer work and helping others, I constantly have ideas and slave away relentlessly past the point of exhaustion; I'll often pull all-nighters and just sacrifice aspects of my life like sleep, eating, exercise, social life etc. to crank out as much work done as possible. 

I don't really know how to relax and rarely watch TV, play video games, go out with friends etc. anymore cause I feel like I'm wasting time I could be being productive/producing something. Work is pretty much the only thing that brings me a sense of satisfaction/meaning and makes me feel slightly less useless and pathetic in my existence, and just generally cynical and hopeless about the world.

Anyway I was just wondering if anyone else here is similar? I have some theories as to why I push myself to work so hard and think a lot of it stems from low self-esteem, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, anxiety, existential dread etc. but am interested to hear why others feel like they might be this way. 

I know it may seem counter to depression, and I do go through periods of ""worse"" depression in total despair where I can't get myself to do anything, though I can normally now get into the mindset of it's better to stay alive doing *something* like volunteering than kill myself, and I somehow manage to push through the darkest periods.

I was so stuck for years to try and find a solution and now finally I&amp;#39;ve done it, so I encourage you to just try something, for me it was slimming down, maybe for you it&amp;#39;s just getting more time outside, spending more time with people in general, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving up and accepting you&amp;#39;re stuck this way not only harms you, it harms your family, friends, co-workers. Just try, you haven&amp;#39;t got to go full grind mode, but trying means your moving, you may not see it in a week, a month or even a year, but it means you&amp;#39;re moving away from your depression and towards a better future. That&amp;#39;s all, from someone probably not so different to you.&lt;/p&gt;

I live most of my life pretty much normally without much mental distress until about 3 years ago.

I decided to use this as a stepping stone to get my foot in the door for future job-hunts. Fast forward 8 months later, I was bullied and gas-lighted by my boss and had extremely toxic and backstabbing co-workers. I had to leave the company, as I foresaw myself getting fired, as well as to save my mental health. Had to see a therapist a couple of times to convince myself that the entire thing wasn't my fault (Result of being gaslighted). Losing my job also caused me to lose my residency in that country (I was a foreign worker). After trying to look for a new job for another 8 months with no luck, I decided to study again in another country.  With this fresh start, I started to slowly regain my confidence and aced my classes. However, 3 months into studying, my long-term girlfriend of 4 years left me with no warning through text (It was a long distance relationship). This obviously caused a drastic drop in my confidence and motivation and I started flunking my classes. I also started to binge-drink, practically intoxicated 99% of the time, the other 1% is the morning right before I drink my first drink. However luckily, through support from my newfound friends as well as family, I managed to pull through and was finally sober after 3 months.

I also have occasional thoughts that people can just leave me anytime they want and no matter what I do now, there is nothing I can do to stop it from happening (Probably because of the breakup). When I'm in this mood, I also lose interest in doing things I usually like such as playing music and video games. It has caused minor inconveniences in my relationship (mainly my partner has to re-assure me about certain things), and sometimes it makes me a little bit insecure and makes it hard for me trust my partner, or anyone in general (only when I'm in this ""mood""). As I am graduating(again) soon and I have to yet again enter the adult world, thinking about getting a job gives me bad memories and triggers this mood more often.

I have an issue and would like to hear someone else's opinion. 
I lost my mother almost three years ago, she died from lung cancer. I'm a very emotional person and very attached to my family. During her struggles, I was mostly away from home because I started studying at the faculty. I couldn't focus, always felt anxious and worried because of her condition. I had even hurt myself once, 3 cuts on my forearm. 
She died when I was 20 years old. As time passed, it got a bit easier, but I'm still unable to hold my tears and emotions when I visit her grave, or even see a picture of her in my phone. Recently found out that my father started seeing another woman. I want him to be happy and not spend the rest of his life alone, but is it too much to tell him that I don't ever want to meet that woman or have any contact with her? I'm not willing to even give her a chance or anything. I mean, I can live with them being together and everything, as long as I don't know any of it. It does sound very selfish of me to ask something like that, but she doesn't mean anything to me and I don't want her in my life, but I do care for my father and would like to have a good relationship with him, without involving her in there.
If anyone has any advice or an answer to my question, I'd gladly hear you out, because I'm lost, I don't know what else to do.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

Before I explain myself I need to be clear here, this album is dark, and not like Listen Before I Go by Billie Eilish or anything like that. This album comes from a very, VERY personal place for Uboa (the artist herself) at from what I understand was a very difficult time in her life. The sound is very sparse and ambient at times and shrieking and intense at others, it feels more like the soundtrack to a well-paced horror movie. It's scary in a way few things can achieve and forces you to confront all these emotions in a way that is terrifyingly accurate and often uncomfortable. If you don't find comfort in dark/depressing music I honestly think you should ignore this album despite how good it is IMO.

This album is incredibly dark and intense and I would only recommend it if you use music as a form of comfort and enjoy ambient/industrial music. If you want an idea without listening to it, watch Anthony Fantano's review it's a good summary.

To put it simply, this album contains blood-curdling screams, glitchy ambience and strange samples that make it an album that has the ability to give you a panic attack. Which it can and has done to me, but despite that so many moments on this thing left me breathless and beside myself, it's atmospheric as fuck and Uboa has zero trouble facing her problems head on and she clearly put everything into making it.

IMO the biggest pros to this album are two things :

1. The sound, when this album becomes distorted and glitchy it's uncomfortable but never unlistenable and the ambience hits you directly and can make anything and everything else fade away around you, the opening of the title song floors me every time. It's the kind of music that you need to listen to alone, in a room, at night for it to truly hit you. It's also worth mentioning that the album captures a lot of the moods that depression can take : quiet and reflective but also overwhelming and tormenting. 
2. The lyrics, honestly some of the best I've ever listened to in an album that deals with these topics. The lyrics essentially act as stanzas of poetry that are either quietly and carefully delivered or screamed like the desperate cries of a murder victim. Whichever one it is, they make the entire atmosphere of the album feel hopeless and weary in the best way possible and there are some disturbing, relatable and genuinely sad ideas on display. With titles like ""Please Don't Leave me"" and ""Detransitioning"" it's pretty clear that Uboa is working through some stuff with it but in a way where the listener can twist it to fit their own feelings. 

It's about 40 minutes long and I'd say worth a listen, if you are at that point where you can't sleep or just alone and having a really intense episode, this album can be comforting. I've had it on for the last week along with Deathconsciousness (another good album btw) and it's pretty overpowering. 

If you use music as a comfort I'd seriously give this one a listen but be prepared for some intense sounds, emotions and production or this will knock you flat.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I imagine most people have heard of this album through theneedledrop so think of this post as a sort of personal review since I use music like this for comfort when I&amp;#39;m at my lowest.&lt;/p&gt;

The saddest thing is that he rejects me, he says that he needs some time alone to work things out. I don’t know how to help him.

However I see how he is gradually getting more and more upset. He has lost all his hobbies, he used to have many friends and now he only have me. I feel that something is wrong cause he tells me how bad he is and that he has no future. It all started when he went to college. It is so overwhelming for him. He is really smart so I don’t know why it is so hard for him to study. Anyway I didn’t know how bad it is until yesterday when I visited him unexpectedly. He looked as if he has been crying all night. He looked so drained. I wanted to burst into tears as soon as I saw him. He told me he cant sleep at night, he can’t focus and he is overwhelmed by everything, the school, the fact that he don’t have his own money, that his parents don’t really support him, he said that if it wasn’t me he would kill himself. The saddest thing is that he rejects me, he says that he needs some time alone to work things out. I don’t know how to help him.

&amp;#x200B;

The last years of my life have been a accumulation of dissapointments, I lost almost everything. I lost my school my girlfriend who I had 4 years my passion and my future because of injurys and healthproblems.

I am only 23 years old but everyday feels like a burden and it only gets worse, it started when I was 17.

I'm done with the torment and im planning to kill myself the only problem is I dont know how I wanna do it. I saw some videos where you can order a package online with a recourse to kill yourself I dont know where to find it.

Besides that I tried hanging myself 2 times and i didnt work out for me I was scared or grabbed the rope when I hanged. I wouldnt say im a pussy i just dont want it to hurt that much.

Does anyone has any advice or a site where I can order such a product?

I tried to make this story as short as possible it comes down to this: There was so much negativity im my life at  a short time that i cant see the positive anymore its to less and it feels its not worth living anymore for me at the moment. Some people have more luck then others and I hope nobody has to go down the road I did.

Thanks a lot for your time. And help for the product would be very much appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

But I am lonely, extremely, indescribably lonely. I have several groups of friends, some very close, I have many female friends, I have a good relationship with my parents and work colleagues. I volunteer. I do everything right, but without physical love I am in despair.
I am talking to a girl, but it is very long distance and I have no idea how to maintain her interest in me, I am trying not to come on too strong, overshare, or be needy, but that may be too much for me. Every other girl quickly gets bored and ghosts me. 
I am recovering from a particularly painful break up. I met the woman of my dreams, she approached me first. We couldn't be together, and she spent 18 months messing with my heart, until finally, we were together. it was perfect. I had never believed in ""the one"" or ""soulmates"" before, but she truly made me believe, I couldn't escape how incredibly well matched we were. But after three weeks the pain of losing her mother and all the other troubles she faced became too much and she left me to work on herself. That was 4 months ago, and today I thought she might contact me.

I am trying to improve myself, and this week has been turbulent but I made a lot of progress, bit today it came crashing down. I went out to visit a National Trust place and it was nice, sunny and peaceful.  But every 10 minutes I'd get a wave of heartbreak, a literal wave that would consume me and bring me to tears. 
I am so, so lonely. I know no one else can fix me, but I am great! I have a lot to offer, I'm smart, funny, interesting, passionate and have so much love to give. But it seems that no one else sees that.

The past few months (probably even longer) I've felt awful. A little backstory about me:  
I'm almost 15 and a big part of my life I took online classes, and didn't attend public school. I tried a couple of times at age 6, 9 and now 14 to attend a public school. Last year I started at a new school right before summer vacation. I made some ""best"" friends, turned out they were both very toxic, and after months of being belittled, called ugly, left outside etc. I cut off all contact with them, and it felt amazing in the moment.  
Now, it isn't all that great. All of that happened about a *year* ago. Now I'm not in school anymore, because I honestly just stopped going altogether. 

Here's where the depression comes in.   
I don't have any friends, at all. I talk to no one, and I'm home all day everyday, and I haven't hung out or interacted with anyone my age for the entire time since I stopped going to school. With no one, I truly do mean no one. 

I like being alone, I always have - but I don't like being lonely, and there's a massive difference. Being lonely is the most suffocating feeling ever, and I don't know how to get better. 

Everyone tells me, ""Talk to people! Initiate conversations! Join a club"" basically, a lot of people have been saying ""just make new friends"" as if it's that easy. My problem isn't social interactions, I personally think I do fine with that. How am I supposed to join clubs, though, when I can't even get out of bed in the morning?

Now, I'm just at home 24/7. I watch some Netflix, play some video games, or just lay in bed/on the couch every single day. Even the smallest of tasks are unbearable. I have a dog, and walking him is the most impossible thing ever. Just getting ready will drain all of my energy.  Just taking on my shoes. Getting up and making food for myself, even if it's just toast or cereal, is unbearable. Showering. Getting out of bed in the morning. It's all impossible.   
To some, that might just seem like typical teenager behavior.. but personally it's stopping me from enjoying my life. It's difficult at any age to not have friends, but my teenage years is something I'll never forget, and being alone and depressed in them, is not something I want to remember them by.   
I'm not sad, just kind of empty. Like I have no motivation, no motivation to do anything at all. I can't concentrate on anything, and I can't do stuff I used to enjoy. I have nothing to look forward to, at all. It's been getting a lot worse the past month, a LOT worse. To the point where I can't do anything an entire day, because I just don't know where or how to start. I feel like I'm always tired, and on the verge of breaking. I feel everything and nothing at the same time, I can lay and stare and do nothing for hours and hours on end, and then a wave of extreme emotions will wash over me, and I'll probably cry, because I feel so shitty and helpless.   


Btw:   
My dad was diagnosed with depression last year, and from what he's told me and my family, it's exactly how I feel. I know my family would be supporting, as we're a lot that has struggled with mental health.. but I feel like I might just be overreacting, and I wouldn't want to seek help if that's the case.. but I truly am doing awful. 

My question is now, based on you guys experiences with depression, does it sound to you like I'm just being lazy, or do you think I should seek help? The waitlist here to a therapist or psychiatrist is pretty long, and can take as much as 8 months to see one.

 I’m a paranoid schizophrenic and I’m just very tired .I have had suicidal thoughts everyday for probably the past 4-5 years.. Nothing intense though, it’s usually just a “lights out” kinda thing. Where I just romanticize blowing my brains out or hanging myself to get myself to sleep at night and cope with problems. It’s usually just comforting but I never really plan anything. This last year I’ve been arrested, fucked up my car and am in a lot of trouble with my parents. I’m 22 and have no goals or job since I’ve been arrested and live by myself.  

Today (an hour ago) something changed I guess? I’m just kinda done with life. I feel like I’ve lived as much as I want and just don’t really care about living anymore. Today is the first day in my life where I am actually serious about doing it. It’s not like dark or edgy or depressing anymore; I’m just very comfortable with killing myself to where it doesn’t scare me anymore. It’s a very calm feeling. Like I said I don’t even feel depressed I feel emotionless about it. And living just seems bothersome and not worthwhile to the point where I’m making plans.

I don’t know what to do and don’t see my life getting any better anytime soon because of how much of a fucking disappointment I’ve  been to my parents and myself. I’m lazy, unmotivated, don’t care about winning at life and realize I’m just a failure and refuse to change. I don’t even want to try and get my life on track and just want out. It’s just not worth it to me anymore, I just don’t see myself changing because of how afraid I am of everything. 

I am calm and actually relaxed for the first time in years and I’m relatively certain I am going to kill my self within the next month or so. My birthday is coming up before thanksgiving and I want to see my parents (they live in another state) before I do it so they can see me again.

I had recently realized I was gay, after several years of crushes on dudes and only watching gay porn, yep I was dense. Whole entire worldview changed. Much more distant from extremely religious family than before. Yes, they’re homophobic. Yes, they have explicitly stated they would kill a gay son. Russians man. I was depressed, had social anxiety, and felt trapped and lonely.  

So I would sometimes sleep in this random fucking bus we had in the front yard to be alone (six siblings, two bedroom house). 

On a day I did this, my father woke me up. We had an argument about something, ending with him beating me and smashing my phone. I started crying (I’m less of a pussy now, or at least I’d like to think that), which angered him more. I tried to leave, he made me stay. He forcefully embraced me (what the fuck?), which freaked me out even more. 

He just wanted to talk to me, he said.

At this point I was bawling my eyes out and screaming (I was a little bitch and scared of him), trying to leave. He forced me to sit and try to talk to him. I was having a full blown panic attack/ a nervous breakdown/ idk shit was intense. He pulls out a gun and I’m done. It’s over. I’m gonna die.

He asked if I wanted him dead.  He handed me the gun and told me to shoot him if I wanted him dead. I was in shock, I guess. He kept asking. I did not shoot him (shame). I started laughing maniacally while still wailing, scaring him. He rammed his head through the glass window of the van, shattering it. He explained it was so he wouldn’t hurt me. Cause that’s what sane people do. 

...the van incident actually was traumatic. Oh.

He had physically abused me as a child when he had temper tantrums, leaving marks and bruises.

He brought a gun with him to wake me up. 

He asked me to kill him.

He got rid of the van the next day. 

The past few years, I forced the memories away. It never happened. I was passively suicidal, constantly abused whatever drugs or alcohol I could get, and wondered why I always felt like shit or empty inside. I attempted suicide and blamed myself for hurting myself for no reason. 

I have a psychiatric intake tomorrow, and decided to write down all the stuff I needed help with. I had a nervous breakdown reliving the incident.

Now I feel dumb. How the fuck did I not realize that it wasn’t normal behavior? Why’d I gloss over it all these years? 

At least I sort of have an explanation now... Now how the fuck do I get out of this house?

&lt;p&gt;People say depression makes you see the world in a more negative way than it actually is. But who needs depression for that? You will notice that the world IS a generally negative, bad and evil place - except if you&amp;#39;re rich and privileged - if you just pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is a horrible place. Our society turned it into one. People who are healthy are just able to deal with it or ignore it. People who are sick receive drugs and/or therapy to make them able to deal with it or ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;

And before you brush me off, let me tell you why. 
It'll be a good day. Going about business as usual, feeling like things are finally starting to get back to normal. 
Maybe catching up with some of those neglected friends who became so out of fear they’d get too close and see you for what you truly are.

And then? Drinks are suggested. Just one, not even enough to be buzzed, just something to be sociable.
You resist valiantly at first, insisting you don’t need it and proudly relishing in your conviction. 
But, whether it be over the next few days, weeks, or even months, your resolve begins to weaken. 
“What’s one night?” You think. 
“I work hard, I deserve to let loose for once”.
And oh, you do.

It starts with a couple drinks, back to back. 
You hardly feel a difference. 
So, you have a few more.
And a few more. 
And, more. After all you’ve made it this far, why stop now? 

It’s almost always about here that feeling begins creeping at the edge of your consciousness. 
A resentful look here, a disapproving comment there.
At first you’re able to cast them off as a result of overthinking and blurred rationality, but as the night goes on it gets worse.
And worse.
And worse.

Suddenly, strangers are hyper analyzing down to the slightest change in your posture, boring deeply rooted holes of self hatred into your psyche with unforgiving eyes. 
Those who know you best, unfortunately offer no relief.
Every intimate moment shared in confidence comes rushing painfully back as you suspect they’ve only ever lent a listening ear so as to pinpoint your insecurities, and validate them. 

Such a fool you were to think anyone could love you with your abundance of detrimental flaws. 
All you want to do is pull further and further into yourself until you simply cease to exist. At least then those dreadful eyes would have nothing left to sink into. 
Sadly, you can never seem to figure out how. 
No matter how much you dodge and duck and deny and justify, it’s just not enough. 
Everything you say is wrong. 
Everything you do is wrong. 
So why try?
You know it’s all an act, and at the end of the day you’re still a burden holding back the rest of humanity. 
And then finally . . . Finally.
Nothing.

The next day you’re back to normal.
Well, pretending to be normal.
But it’s too late.
They know.
And they’ll never forget.
No matter how much you beg for forgiveness for showing such weakness, those god damn eyes are unrelentless.
They may brush it off now, but you'll know under the surface, they’re only one mistake away from catapulting you back into that lost place.

The best four years of my life. The music, the people. I didnt even know racism was a thing.

 Destiny was still an amazing game, doing raids with my friends. It seems like I have barely any friends anymore. Or really, no one want to be associated with me. It was because of secondary school. People acting hard, smoking, drinking, fighting. I never participated once in any of these, and people made me feel like a loser for it. Even my old friends ditched me because they had new friends. One of their new friends harassed me online until I just ignored him. He turned out to be an arse and my friend ditched him. But then he went and found someone exactly like himself. They're still inseparable to this day. At school people would bully me because I had a black belt. Funny isn't it? You'd expect people to leave you alone FOR that reason. 

One day some kid pushed me and I snapped. I grabbed him and kneed him in his stomach and kicked him in his ribs. He had another friend and they both fought me at once. I kicked the other guy in his chest but the original one sucker punched me to my balls. I got up and saw red. My face was visibly red. And I'm a darker mixed race person, so it's very hard to see my face get red. But then someone grabbed one of them  by the arm and took them out of the fight because now it was ""fair""? Then a teacher came and then everyone either turned around or ran away. Then I was the _""bad guy""_ .  

This is the reason that from 2017 and onwards, i have not felt the same. I have recently moved to germany and it's difficult. The languge is really hard for me but I have had ALOT of practice. Everything is different now but no one wants to be associated with me because I don't speak german as well as everyone else does...

&lt;p&gt;Destiny was still an amazing game, doing raids with my friends. It seems like I have barely any friends anymore. Or really, no one want to be associated with me. It was because of secondary school. People acting hard, smoking, drinking, fighting. I never participated once in any of these, and people made me feel like a loser for it. Even my old friends ditched me because they had new friends. One of their new friends harassed me online until I just ignored him. He turned out to be an arse and my friend ditched him. But then he went and found someone exactly like himself. They&amp;#39;re still inseparable to this day. At school people would bully me because I had a black belt. Funny isn&amp;#39;t it? You&amp;#39;d expect people to leave you alone FOR that reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day some kid pushed me and I snapped. I grabbed him and kneed him in his stomach and kicked him in his ribs. He had another friend and they both fought me at once. I kicked the other guy in his chest but the original one sucker punched me to my balls. I got up and saw red. My face was visibly red. And I&amp;#39;m a darker mixed race person, so it&amp;#39;s very hard to see my face get red. But then someone grabbed one of them  by the arm and took them out of the fight because now it was &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot;? Then a teacher came and then everyone either turned around or ran away. Then I was the &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;bad guy&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; .  &lt;/p&gt;

I grew up with parents who had a bad marriage with a lot of fighting and everything that comes with a toxic marriage.

Anyway, i was always at war with myself, i would hurt myself and then i wouldnt and then i would and then i wouldnt. 
At age 17 i was diagnosed with disrealisation.

I was able to find a job, get my license and just generally become a more able human being.

So after i told my doc i had some pretty bad anxiety when on ritalin (which he prescribed me for studying), adding to the anxiety i have even without ritalin, he prescribed me alprazolam (xanax on the US i think?, i'll just call it that since it's shorter), and holy shit does this stuff work, basically ALL of my anxiety was gone 20 minutes after taking it, and this one isn't even expensive like the other stuff! amazing, right?

No, kind of. Now, i don't know if this is just because xanax took the anxiety off and the depression is just taking over saying thank god now i can ruin his life in peace, or it's actually one of the effects xanax has on you, but my depression feels much worse. Before, on most days, i could actually function, i gave at least half a fuck about taking showers and especially studying, or anything, but now, holy shit i'm lucky if i can read a single paragraph before trying to stab myself with the pen i'm holding out of frustration, also no desire to play games, or use the computer, i use my phone to browse reddit and that's it, if i take ritalin i have 4 hours of """"entertainment"""", where i kind of want to do things, but after that, it's back to hell. 

Sorry for the yelling. The question is, is it actually the xanax directly causing this 'zombie mode', or is it more of a side effect of xanax eliminating the anxiety, leaving the depression free to do what it wants?

if it's the former then great, just switch meds. but holy shit if it's the latter, my depression has gotten much, much worse than i had thought.

Can't sleep and it's usually like this every night, so why not spend my time posting about it. Ever since the school year started, I've grown to depend on using melatonin or weed every night to help me sleep because it's almost impossible to sleep naturally now. Here's why.

I literally keep myself and my mind busy throughout the whole day so I don't get stuck in my own thoughts because it is almost entirely full of negativity. The only time I do get stuck in my own thoughts is when I am about to sleep and that almost always keeps me awake. 

I finished two years of college and ended up getting put on academic leave for my bad grades, because I lost the motivation to go to school and do homework. I blame both my anxiety from having to go to classes as well as my laziness. My dad then convinced me to do a semester of online courses at a community college, which I have also lost motivation to do. The shitty part about this is that my dad keeps believing that I'll do better and decides to waste his hard earned money to help me get through school. I already have one brother that has completely failed him and I am getting close to that. It just eats me up inside every time I get stuck in my thoughts, because in a way I'm using him for spending money on a lost cause. I could've never asked for a better dad, honestly, I wish I could prove myself in school, but just can't for some reason. 

After 21 years of constantly disappointing my dad with my horrible grades throughout elementary, middle and high school, I think it's just finally hit me of how much I am putting my dad through. 

I've heard that working out really helps getting your thoughts straight and all, but I've been working out nonstop for 3 months now and, nothing. It doesn't seem to be helping with anything except my physical appearance. 

About every night, I think, why not just go into my garage and end it now? Wouldn't that just be easy for everyone and not have to be another useless and disappointing son? I then persuade myself to not do it just yet, I want to live life and try finding someone to care for. I have this small amount of hope that having a partner that I can love will help me get my life back on track. I am even pursuing that love right now, with a girl I've known as a coworker for 5 months, but I'm scared at the same time lol. It could definitely fail, who knows.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is a lot of me rambling on and speaking my mind and I apologize in advance if it&amp;#39;s confusing, but I feel that I just needed to tell someone about my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

I graduated with an associate degree on the medical field. I was planning on taking the test right away but at that same year, I found out dad has stage 4 colon cancer and its terminal. Hes still alive which I'm so thankful for but I cant help but to feel so damn depressed. He is truly the only best friend and father I have. He's always so understanding and patient with me. We all used to work all together as a family but due to underlying circumstances we all also lost our job this year and it's been so difficult lately. My dad is an Uber/Lyft driver now so he can help my brother and mom out. My brother has autism so he has a hard time looking for jobs and everything just feel so dim at the moment. 

I decided to take my life more seriously now and so I had been taking the board exam and although I became a Certified Therapist, it's still not good enough for me to be Registered. I had been taking this board exam so many times already and I kept failing by 10 points all the time. This is really the only hindrance in my life that I need to get through so I can get my life together but I took the test again today and failed by 9 points this time. I dont know what to do anymore.

Not only this but I got into a car accident 2 weeks ago and it greatly affected my life and finances. I dont have a job right now and just been living through my savings but it's about to run out 

It feel like when I want to get my life back on track, something bad always happen. Like i dony know how to keep my head up anymore. I started drinking today to numb the pain but it just made it worse and i got even more sick.

I really need some advice here. I just feel so dumb and useless. I feel such a disappointing to my family especially my dad and my bf. I get these feeling that my friends look down on me because I'm broke and I dont have my career set yet.

I could use some friend or a smack in the head so I can get my shit back on track.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title says it all. I graduated with an associate degree on the medical field. I was planning on taking the test right away but at that same year, I found out dad has stage 4 colon cancer and its terminal. Hes still alive which I&amp;#39;m so thankful for but I cant help but to feel so damn depressed. He is truly the only best friend and father I have. He&amp;#39;s always so understanding and patient with me. We all used to work all together as a family but due to underlying circumstances we all also lost our job this year and it&amp;#39;s been so difficult lately. My dad is an Uber/Lyft driver now so he can help my brother and mom out. My brother has autism so he has a hard time looking for jobs and everything just feel so dim at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to take my life more seriously now and so I had been taking the board exam and although I became a Certified Therapist, it&amp;#39;s still not good enough for me to be Registered. I had been taking this board exam so many times already and I kept failing by 10 points all the time. This is really the only hindrance in my life that I need to get through so I can get my life together but I took the test again today and failed by 9 points this time. I dont know what to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only this but I got into a car accident 2 weeks ago and it greatly affected my life and finances. I dont have a job right now and just been living through my savings but it&amp;#39;s about to run out &lt;/p&gt;

I feel I was robbed of a math education and now only know up to algebra 2 and statistics. I feel like there are entire swaths of information missing that can never be replaced. Critical thinking skills I lack because we would learn only 3 chapters in an entire year (no child left behind bullshit). 

I'm good at humanities, writing, and analytical thinking, but problem solving is a real struggle for me. It seems like I'm damned if I take a degree where my strengths are at because no career attached to them can pay off the debt it costs to attain them. But I'm also damned if I go into a tech/math field where everyone else has an advantage over me. 

I know there is the medical field but I have actual homophobia that will render me unconscious or nauseous. Also, I'm not good with my hands but more of a brainstormer/writer. 

I see these career lists with various managers and engineers topping out in income and there are no humanities represented. It's as if all of my weaknesses are what this world functions on and it's very demoralizing. I constantly am trying to become smarter and better at critical thinking but I know my brains developmental potential is pretty much over and I'm just wasting my time. 

Trying to learn computer coding languages was seeming pretty easy because I have a natural gift for languages, but trying to make sense of actual code? Like creating an order of operations and understanding how things work together? It is panic-attack inducing for me. I cant visualize a detailed system in my mind, I'm only good at seeing the big picture and guessing where something might fail, I can't contain the information for how one action plays into another efficiently. It's a huge weakness for me, and all of the psychology tests I have done have said the same. 

I have a great memory to where i can pass college classes without taking notes or studying, but I rely on memory recall triggers and odd associations I make. I can't see all the information at once or anything like that. 

I'm worried I'll be some worthless nobody making 35 thousand a year substitute teaching because that's the only viable option i see right now that plays to my strengths and isnt extremely debt inducing (it still is to some extent). 

I'm watching my friends begin trade apprenticeships that will end with them making 135-200k dollars a year. They will be able to raise families and enjoy life. I'll always just be scraping by.

I'm too physically fucked up to work a job like that, I'm only 20 and nearly all of my joints already show serious damage to the cartilage and I hurt all the time. I dont know why because I never physically overexerted myself, I just have weak, brittle joints and bones. 

As it is I work a minimum wage job 30-40 hours a week and am hit with car trouble, medical bills, college fees, and more all the time. I'm not able to save but 100 or 200 dollars a paycheck and it feels like its adding up to nothing when I see college tuition costs of 20k a year (conservatively) in my future. 

There isnt even a career I want to do which is another big problem. I've been depressed my entire life and have thought about killing myself daily since I was 8 years old. Its just part of my routine now. I break down and cry at the end of every day and feel the hopelessness wash over me. It's only been amplified by bad decisions I made in highschool that damaged my brain even further. 

I just have no passion for anything even though I force myself to have hobbies and exercise, life is really hard for me and none of my friends show any support. They are all sociopaths who hardly believe in emotions and sure as hell wont allow me to show any. I'm hated by everyone else in the community (I made a lot of enemies when I was young), and I cant leave my friends because they would be vengeful and ruin my life as they have threatened to do.

I just feel really stuck and directionless even though I'm working harder than I ever have in my life. My mom and grandma just died and my dad has terminal cancer so things arent good at home either. I dont go to school full time so I dont get the free therapy access and I have no health insurance to pay for any outside of that.

&lt;p&gt;I have a great memory to where i can pass college classes without taking notes or studying, but I rely on memory recall triggers and odd associations I make. I can&amp;#39;t see all the information at once or anything like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m worried I&amp;#39;ll be some worthless nobody making 35 thousand a year substitute teaching because that&amp;#39;s the only viable option i see right now that plays to my strengths and isnt extremely debt inducing (it still is to some extent). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m watching my friends begin trade apprenticeships that will end with them making 135-200k dollars a year. They will be able to raise families and enjoy life. I&amp;#39;ll always just be scraping by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m too physically fucked up to work a job like that, I&amp;#39;m only 20 and nearly all of my joints already show serious damage to the cartilage and I hurt all the time. I dont know why because I never physically overexerted myself, I just have weak, brittle joints and bones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is I work a minimum wage job 30-40 hours a week and am hit with car trouble, medical bills, college fees, and more all the time. I&amp;#39;m not able to save but 100 or 200 dollars a paycheck and it feels like its adding up to nothing when I see college tuition costs of 20k a year (conservatively) in my future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isnt even a career I want to do which is another big problem. I&amp;#39;ve been depressed my entire life and have thought about killing myself daily since I was 8 years old. Its just part of my routine now. I break down and cry at the end of every day and feel the hopelessness wash over me. It&amp;#39;s only been amplified by bad decisions I made in highschool that damaged my brain even further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just have no passion for anything even though I force myself to have hobbies and exercise, life is really hard for me and none of my friends show any support. They are all sociopaths who hardly believe in emotions and sure as hell wont allow me to show any. I&amp;#39;m hated by everyone else in the community (I made a lot of enemies when I was young), and I cant leave my friends because they would be vengeful and ruin my life as they have threatened to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel really stuck and directionless even though I&amp;#39;m working harder than I ever have in my life. My mom and grandma just died and my dad has terminal cancer so things arent good at home either. I dont go to school full time so I dont get the free therapy access and I have no health insurance to pay for any outside of that. I&amp;#39;m really struggling to find some path that can give me enough money so I dont have to worry about this all day every day.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t know what exactly makes people think I’m weird, but it may have to do with my anxious personality, my intellectual disability (mild spectrum) or how quiet I am or how ugly I am (I don’t like talking much due to my lisp).
I have been suffering from severe depression and anxiety ever since I was a kid due to some trauma. And it has gotten worse and I feel like my health is getting worse. I don’t even have a support group and I just want to know what it’s like to have people actually like me for once. People just throw me away like trash and it’s so tiring. I don’t know what I am doing wrong. Everyday I feel like dying is a better choice cause it’s so painful to even live. (I can’t afford a therapist and a lot of therapist don’t accept my insurance) 
Can anyone give me advice, has anyone gotten through this. Please give me a reason to even try to live. I just feel like I’m wasting my life. ( I rambled a lot here but I’m just having a hard time writing how I feel. It’s so bad, sorry about that)&lt;/p&gt;

So please hang in there.

My entire life, I've been constantly abused. Friendships, relationships, family. I've been molested, raped, hit, gaslit, cheated on countless times, financially abused, emotionally abused, psychologically abused, you name it. It's all I know.

I'm honestly a really modest person. But I know I'm loving, caring, empathetic, driven, loyal, honest and I do my absolute best to be a good person in every aspect. I'm not perfect, and I don't think *anyone* deserves the abuse I've been through. But I especially don't understand why it happens to me. I'm not confrontational. I'm not a controlling bitch. I'm pretty easy going, generally speaking.

Because of my history with abuse, at this point in my life, I'm realizing that I don't trust *anyone* anymore. At all. I let people in just fine and consider myself to be an extremely open person. I don't hide things or try to keep people out. I'm a truly open book and nothing is off limits. But letting people in just makes me trust them even less. It's like agreeing to babysit kids you know are monsters: Yes, I let you into my house. I signed up for this, knowing what I was getting myself into. But now I have to watch every single move you make so I know you're not breaking all my shit since you're here.

My parents divorced when I was 2 and my dad died in an accident at the ripe old age of 39 when I was 15. We didn't have the best relationship for much of my life. But just when things were getting better and I felt close to him for the first time, he died. And it fucked me up for years. And now, almost 13 years later, I'm realizing how much my relationship with him fucked me up too.

I've always craved love and affection. I've never really gotten it from anyone, aside from maybe my mother. I've been married, gotten divorced, been in relationships, had deep meaningful friendships that dissolved into nothing. Nothing lasts forever. I understand that. But I'm a true hopeless romantic and I want that ""forever"" more than I've ever wanted anything. And I think that's why I've tolerated so much abuse and neglect. Just because they were bad to me sometimes didn't mean they were bad to me *all* the time. And if they ""loved"" me, then I was just compromising with myself. That's how I looked at it.

I'm in a relationship now with someone I am absolutely crazy about. He is everything I've ever wanted and more. We haven't been together long by any means (officially together for only about a month) but I already feel all kinds of ways about him that I've never felt for anyone, even my ex husband. We spend time together every chance we get. Sometimes for days straight. But I don't even trust *him* and it breaks my fucking heart because I want to so badly. I pretend I do. I'm not trying to overstep any boundaries and make him think I'm some possessive bitch. But I'm constantly wondering why it's taking him so long to text me back or what he's doing when he seems preoccupied or why he didn't answer his phone. And it makes me feel so horrible. I don't pry and just act like everything is fine, and he honestly seems none the wiser. It's not like I'm completely irrational. There *are* occasional things present that would generate concern from a normal person. But a normal person would give him the benefit of the doubt. I can't.

I've felt like this in every relationship, whether it was justified or not. And as far as friendships go, I'm constantly telling myself that they're just my friend because they feel bad for me. Or that they have something to gain from me. Things like that. I'm not close to any family, aside from my mom and my stepdad and one of my siblings. But I don't *really* trust any of them either. They've all hurt me or lied to me at some point. I don't expect anyone to be perfect. I just want the same unconditional love and loyalty and commitment I have to offer to be returned.

No matter who's around, I always feel completely alone. And I'm too insecure of a person to be as independent as I've had to be. And I know I'm not the only one that feels this way. But that isn't at all comforting. I've never felt so down. I don't want to kill myself, and I don't want to die. I just want to sleep and wake up when everything doesn't suck anymore.

Idk if anyone will actually read this. And idk why I'm even posting this. Guess I just needed to vent about it to strangers online because I don't have to pretend to trust any of you.

Anyway, if you *did* read this: Thanks. I hope you're having a better day than I am.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is probably going to be all over the place, but so are my thoughts. So please hang in there.&lt;/p&gt;

Got two jobs recently, one at school and one at Target. Haven't started the school one since it requires finger printing. Other income is financial aid, but I wouldn't doubt that I have to give it back after how poorly I'm doing. 

Living with my grandpa, aunt, uncle, and cousin. They are incredibly toxic, to the point where I just can't be home most of the time. I honestly think my ridiculously toxic family is to blame for how ongoing and severe my depression is on top of clinical stuff. I live in near constant anger, frustration, and misery. Maybe I'm blaming my family too much but prior to living here, my depression was totally manageable with an antidepressant. And now it does absolutely nothing. I can't focus on school or homework because I'm either so drained mentally because of them or I'm busy with work or trying to move out.

I've pushed away a lot of people I shouldn't have and I'm so insanely lonely. Tried a couple dating apps to see if maybe that would help but all it did was just bring down my already precarious confidence and self worth.

I know I've got stuff going for me but it feels like I'm drowning and there's nobody else there. I almost never cry but I'm on the verge of tears seemingly every day. I'm normally a pretty resilient person but everything just destroys me every day. So much stress and worry about what I'm going to eat, if my family is going to kick me out, if I'm going to have to give back financial aid, if I'm going to pass my classes, all with support from max 5 internet friends I speak to once or twice a week.

I've tried setting up therapy appointments but after the 4th one being unable to, I gave up. I know I should keep trying but, like the dating apps, it just slowly breaks me down.

My only goal is to get a steady income and to get away from my family. All they do is take my money and drive me further down the hole of depression. If I can just make it on my own I think I can work at fixing the small problems, work at making school a success and not the failure it's been the last 3 semesters. I just need to get out and away from my family before I jump in front of a train.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried setting up therapy appointments but after the 4th one being unable to, I gave up. I know I should keep trying but, like the dating apps, it just slowly breaks me down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only goal is to get a steady income and to get away from my family. All they do is take my money and drive me further down the hole of depression. If I can just make it on my own I think I can work at fixing the small problems, work at making school a success and not the failure it&amp;#39;s been the last 3 semesters. I just need to get out and away from my family before I jump in front of a train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways I&amp;#39;m gonna go to bed now because I have to be up in 5 hours for work. Goodnight Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

As a couple years passes since she passed, my mother and father decide to get a divorce. My dad was a drug addict and he was dealing drugs. We were very wealthy and rich, but my father still wanted drugs and he couldn’t stop, he wouldn’t stop. They split up and my dad moved out of our house and into the city. I, ashamed of myself still for this, chose to live with my dad. Because he had money, and my mom didn’t. One day while we were at home, the police and swat team raided my dads house. They threw a flash bang into the house, and I was hit by it. I’m still haunted by that event till this day.

3 years later, I was severely SEVERELY depressed never leaving my bedroom everyday. I didn’t even go to school. I was locked in my room at all times. I attempted suicide around 5 times. I never could go through with it. I was lost and I couldn’t take anything anymore.

About 2.5 years later or around that time frame, it’s early 2017. Me and my ex at the time just broke up so I was devastated at that point. I get a call from my grandma, I pick up and she says,”Your dad overdosed. He’s in the hospital right now.” I was in shock and I didn’t know how to react. He is still alive, but deep down I feel like I really lost my dad that day. 

Around 6-7 months later, it’s November 12th, 2017. I’m laying in my bed room in the dark crying my eyes out from my depression and anxiety. I text my friend wondering what was going on and why everyone was freaking out on social media. His name was Tristan, I called him T. I texted,”T, you okay?” 5 minutes later I text my other friend and I ask,”Hey what’s going on with T and them?” He said,”It’s Tristan.” I replied,”Tristan? What the fuck happened man?” He said,”He’s dead. He hung himself. He’s at the hospital rn.” I fell to the ground... my best friend that I had known since the first grade, took his own life. Everyone has that person that got them out of their mind when they needed it, and he was that to me. After all the help he gave me, I wasn’t there to help him when he needed it. 

5 months later, it’s April 25th 2018. I meet a girl who is my first true love. Of course I dated girls before her, but I never truly loved someone until her. I was extremely depressed, I just lost my best friend 5 months ago. And she was depressed too. She was that person like Tristan who helped me out of the worst times of my life. 

A year and a half later, we break up. Now we’re here to this day today. October 22nd. Sometimes I question whether I can take another day of this. Everyday it seems like I can’t get out of bed. They expect you to get up and act like everything is okay. Depression is so terrible, and I don’t know how people can live like I do. I know people deal with what I deal with, and I have been dealing with it for way too long... I just feel like there’s gotta be a way out of my head. 

Nowadays I just throw on Swimming by Mac Miller and listen to his pain so I can just get away. I pray for anyone going through what I have to go through. And just know I love you. I don’t know you, but I love you. It’s so hard in this society to keep fighting the way we all do. I have friends who deal with this, best friends.

Clinically, I’ve had major depression and anxiety for over a year now, but I’ve suffered way longer than that. I’m on two different antidepressants and I don’t think they’re enough anymore, but then again, my life has overall been hectic the last few months so I think it just might be in my head. Bear with me, this is going to be all over the place. 

To put it into perspective, I’m a third year nursing major (too much stress, but in the end it will be rewarding) and I’m someone who is also very hard on themself. I expect myself to be perfect and do perfect. When I’m not, I kind of spiral out of control and everything collapses along with it. I failed one of my major classes tests, which isn’t like me, but it coincides with everything else happening. 

I had a relationship from April until the end of August and it was beyond toxic. I cringe over how foolish I was and how I allowed myself to be treated because I thought it was “love.” Obviously, it wasn’t and I was terribly upset during the entire relationship. The guy I was with was manipulative and knew how to mold me like clay. I’m not proud of what I put myself through because lots of people told me I deserved better. I knew I did, but I loved this person so I stayed. I thought I could fix him. I thought I could heal all his wounds, but by doing this, I reopened all of mine that I had worked months to heal. He ended up moving back to school and I wanted him to commit to me, but he wouldn’t. I spent a good month thinking I wasn’t good enough for him or anyone even though I put him on a pedestal and put up with his lies. I never thought I would end up in an emotionally abusive relationship, but here I am. Booboo the fool. 

Fast forward a few weeks from that episode, my friend persuaded me into downloading tinder so I could get over this guy. I didn’t want to because it felt dirty and wrong, but I knew I needed a distraction. This was a whole ass mistake and for anyone reading this, don’t be stupid like I was. I matched with this guy who was a friend of a friend, and I was coaxed into pursuing him. Everything was wonderful, like a story tale. I couldn’t believe I was finally getting what I had longed for. Well fast forward to the present, all good things come to an end and he just wants to remain friends. That just added to my shit pile. When I have interest in someone, I develop feelings fast and hard. It’s all biting me in the ass now.

A few weeks ago my best friend and I had a falling out. She has been battling her own demons and I love her to death. She knows that I’ve been battling my own too, but together, our battles become completely exhausting. We both agreed we needed room to breathe to try and heal but of course we said we would still be here if we needed each other. I’m used to talking to this girl all day every day about stupid shit. I’ve felt lost without her and I’ve expressed this to her, it’s just that things have been very hard for her. I respect her needs of course, it’s just difficult when your main emotional support is missing. Usually, she’s the one I would be running to to discuss everything I am in this post. But she’s not here. 

Half the time I don’t even know how to put into words how I’m feeling. I constantly feel like I have something sitting on my chest. There’s always a lump in my throat. The only time I feel most normal is when I fake it going to class, work or eating dinner with my family. 

I know that some may suggest I talk about how I’m feeling with my family, except we’re not that kind of family. We each are very private and deal with things on our own. It’s not the healthiest, but I guess it’s what works for us as a unit. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you. I know I probably sound dumb as my issues are very minute compared to others. I just needed to vent and get it out so I would stop crying and hopefully go to sleep. There’s so much more going on with me personally, but this post is already long so I’m going to cut it short. 

I plan on talking to my primary about getting referred to a therapist/psychiatrist and maybe altering some of my meds to help improve my daily quality of life. 

And a reminder for those of you who struggle like me, there are brighter days ahead. Keep trucking along and you are not weak for wanting or looking to receive help. You are strong and your journey isn’t over yet.

This year though, 10th grade, I hate going to school more than ever. I used to have tons of friends but during the time I got so severely depressed, I became close friends with some people I actually didn‘t like at all, just so I wasn‘t alone. This year, I was very motivated to „do me“ and pushed those friends away, which made me feel very guilty and I think hurt them a lot, too. I changed a lot, I felt lost and didn‘t know where I belonged to, and to be honest that‘s still the way it is. I‘ve never felt this alone, most days I can’t even fall asleep and before going to school I start crying and having panic attacks. I can‘t concentrate when I‘m in school because I just keep thinking about all the things I‘ve fucked up and how unhappy I am.
I have tried everything, every bit of advice I got. I‘m in therapy, I do a lot of stuff outside of school, I talk to my mum about it a lot and she absolutely understands and supports me, I considered changing schools but found out it isn‘t possible for my school to change in the middle of the school year. Nothing seems to make this feeling of numbness and darkness and hopelessness and most of all, this feeling that I’m trapped in this excruciating routine, go away. Every morning when I drive to school by bike, I wish for a car to hit me. This morning I woke up knowing that I would have to spend 8 hours in school and I just couldn‘t do it. I asked my mom to have me stay at home and now I‘m laying here not knowing what to do, feeling like I‘ve screwed up once again. Now I‘m even more behind on school work, and other than that I can‘t skip school just because, and if I start doing that, it‘s not going to stop.
There‘s just this big hole of darkness inside my heart and I feel like I‘m underwater and everything is very far away. Very detached from myself, the days are just going by as I drag myself from room to room, from one torture to another. At the end of the day, I feel so tired that I can‘t do anything other than watch some stupid TV before falling into bed. Also, for two years, ever since my unhappiness started, I‘ve been consistently picking at my pimples every day. It used to be so bad that I would spend hours in the bathroom, until I would bleed and the throbbing pain would be too much. My skin now is nearly perfect but I still find ways to poke at it, and on days where school was especially bad, I will do it for hours.
I know this was a lot to read, but I think I really just needed to get this out. There‘s a lot more I could add but this is probably what‘s bugging me the most right now.

I feel invisible and undeserving of people’s attention. And when people do notice me (like one of my five friends here) I have to put on a facade to make it seem like everything is ok, when in reality this is the most “depressed” I’ve been. 

Yeah I talk to my parents and I know they care about me but outside them I feel like I don’t exist. I just go through the motions of college, and for what? Just so I can get a job, get paid, and now be lonely with money?

Social interactions are draining too. I can bear it for maybe a few seconds, but then I start getting anxious because of how much thinking I have to do about what to say just to keep the other party from thinking I’m some sort of weirdo. 

I have absolutely no confidence in myself when it comes to non-academic things. I always think that I’m fat and ugly, so no one could possibly stand to be around me. I talk so little now that my jaw keeps locking from not being used. 

On top of all that, I feel like a fraud. I’m studying math and CS, and I just feel like I’ve cheated my way through life, and that I don’t actually know anything. I guess it’s part of the imposter syndrome from going to a good college.

This will contain some mentions of sex, alcohol, smoking and some mental illness sprinkled in as all shitty stories are. 

So for context I’ve been on meds to manage my depression and anxiety for a little over a year now. While most days are good, I’m still in the process of getting a few minor addictions undercontrol. So this weekend I needed to blow off steam so naturally I planned a fun af weekend for myself. Did everything I don’t have time for in the week, I cleaned, I cooked, I had one fwb over one afternoon, then one evening was spent in the next town over with another fwb who also loves cooking for me and getting fucked up together. So all it was amazing I really just got to cut loose and indulge.

So naturally, not long after getting myself back home I was a little hungover but pretty happy until I sat down to do shit for my lab tomorrow. Depression came and beat me down like it’s bitch. I couldn’t focus, no motivation, binge eating, wanting to self-harm. Fuck just all of it for like 8 hours. 

Once those 8 hours were up was it over? Nah got thrown into a pit of anxiety. Not cool when you gotta get shit done then sleep at some point. Anyways eventually I got my shit done. Despite my knowing better I caved and had a smoke. 

Anyway probably about 10 hours into this bs I realized what my fuck ass had done. I got drunk and I smoked a pipe, but I wasn’t totally smashed. Usually if I get too fucked up I skip my meds for a few reasons. I’ve done it in the past with no problems. Today I guess I wasn’t hungover enough to hide the fact my brain was straight up done giving me seratonin. I’m finally calming down after taking my meds again and being a tiny bit not sober. I hate I have to do shit like this to function day to day. I shouldn’t be relying on a steady stream of sex and alcohol on top of my meds to keep me feeling sane. Maybe I should talk to a therapist about all of this. I don’t want to end up on the suicide watch list again at my university though (due to money constraints I use my university’s services for my mental healthcare). Maybe I should just give in and find a girlfriend who would be down for my bs and also hold me when I’m having a bad day. Who the fuck knows. I think maybe now I can sleep.

Today I found out that I was not admitted into the Uni I worked so hard to get into. It’s been my driving force for getting better in many aspects of my life, and has requires many sacrifices of relationships with family and friends, as well as time to prepare myself for my application. I was so proud of myself to manage being top 93% on the SAT with a perfect GPA. I was hard work, but it kept me going. 

I didn’t make it in. Hundreds of hours of my life cleaning up myself, torturing myself, and picking up the pieces again, all the while sacrificing countless aspects of myself. I punished myself when I didn’t adhere to standards I forced myself into, and it wasn’t enough.

Today I had a huge fight with my mother, who I will now be living with for another year or until I move out. For more reasons than I could fit into a post, I’ll just say that she’s the catalyst for the absolute best and worst parts of my life.

I think I lost my best friend today as well, not to death though. Prolonged issues were finally too much to handle today. I’ve made the decision to separate him from my life, one of my only remaining friends.

Ironically, the friend and mother situations were before I got that dreaded email.

So overall, I’m not proud of myself. I’m just as worthless as I always was. I do deserve any pain or suffering I get, because I’m not worth anything. I’ve known this for a long time, but my last hope to prove myself and start over was stripped from me, and it’s my fault. I’m simply not good enough for anything, this being the final straw.

I’ve got my knife next to me, I’m waiting to break my 7 months.

So, to whoever ends up reading this. Lets begin. I've been around here for a couple of months but never said anything. I feel really selfish for posting here now but I feel as if I don't have any other choice!

I am at my lowest point in 4 years! I saw it getting worse and worse over the past month or two, maybe even longer but I didn't act on anything because I never thought I would get this bad. It certainly wasn't a slow decline and was a rapid decent into this. I am posting here because I just need someone to read this.

Friday, I ended up leaving school early because I just couldn't bring myself to stay I was a broken down mess of a teenage boy, who sat in a toilet for an hour and half in tears. I've ""skipped"" school because I feel like shit and I don't even feel safe going. I am extremely demotivated about doing any form of school work and with Exams coming up this isn't helping. The thought of going back to school is absolutely destroying me mentally and emotionally. I am struggling to get myself to do even remotely anything that I enjoyed. Everything feels so difficult and tough to do, nothing brings me joy and I just sit there not enjoying anything. Playing games, talking to friends, reading books and writing. Nothing is enjoyable for me anymore. I've taken to sleeping during the day a massive amount to just escape the emptiness, loneliness and sadness that I feel. Yet, I still wake up drained and overly tired as if I haven't slept for days. I barely eat anything or keep myself hydrated correctly.

Recently, I decided I needed a break from my friendship group. As I was coming home everyday feeling extremely lonely and in pain. In the end, they where affecting me negatively and for the worse and I felt that was also projecting onto them. I explained I needed a break but would still be friends with them all, and they where all supportive of the decision without a question asked as to truly why. (Although, I feel as if they aren't happy about it and are talking behind my back but that is hopefully my anxiety talking and not the truth.) Yet, I am now feel extremely guilty and like a traitor to all of them. That I've somehow just stabbed them in the back and hurt them trying to do right by myself for once. I ended up talking to the one friend who I don't feel lonely and really shitty around and asked them if they wanted to do more together. Thankfully, they said yes but I can't help but feel extremely guilty for asking such a question. I have sent them a few other messages trying to explain things and apologise for it. They are super understanding and supportive but my own guilt wants me to keep going and I have to actively force myself away from any form of digital contact with them for a little while. As I feel like an annoying pest, they told me I ain't annoying but I still feel like I am.

The worst part about all of this. Is that I am once again having suicidal thoughts and relapsed and cut myself. (I didn't draw blood or have to clean anything up.) I broke down crying when I truly processed what I was doing and went and took a shower that was way to hot. I am stuck up at night for hours just thinking about killing myself or hurting myself. Every waking hour I want to die or hurt myself to make it just go away. I feel so worthless and empty. I really want it all to be over right now.

My dad is very wise and smart, but sometimes his words can hurt and his gossiping make me to hide my true feelings so that he doesn’t tell other people. My mother always belittled me and my dad treats me like a kid. I think they’re doing subconsciously as Asian parents view their children as children no matter the age. I don’t like both of my parents and my closest bond is my sister, but it’s more of like “your my sibling so I have to deal with you” type of relationship. I don’t talk about my feelings and have suppress so much that all of my memories before freshmen year is just a haze. I still have some memories of those time, but not a lot. I do go to the my wellness counselor and talk there, but I’m on the fence of wanting to go and sometimes not wanting to go. My dad twist words and memories that are very crystal clear to me, but to him, it has a totally different narrative. I haven’t seen my mother since she left. I hate them both. I hate how my dad sheltered me so much that I don’t have a good grasp of money. I hate that I’ve lost touch with people, just because I scared that my dad would talk about them. I had that I have to hide my hobbies and the things I love from my dad. I hate that the only time I feel comfortable is away from my house. I hate that I can’t go outside by myself cuz I need to as my dad to drive me there. I hate that I can’t express myself cuz I am a boy and a man has to do manly things. I hate that don’t talk to my friend Patricia as much as I want cuz I feel like any inconvenience to her. I hate that I procrastinate on my hw knowing that I could have done it earlier. I hate that I have to be my dads yes man and agree with every point he has. I hate that I don’t stand up for myself because I’m to scared. I hate that have anxiety. I hate how I feel trapped . I hate how I have deep urges like killing or raping people. I hate that I always act kind to everyone, but I never ask for anything back which makes me feel forgotten. I hate how I can’t be late or can’t be early and have to follow what ever my dad tells me to. I hate how I want to cry so much right now, but I can’t. I hate how I want to do so much but I’m to scared. I hate how I want a girlfriend so that I can have a human who willing to give love, but haven’t had the social silks to do it. I hate how I’m treated as the smart like just because I like history. I hate that no one calls or text to me, but if they do it’s when my dad’s is home and I have to decline. I hate how I could have done so much, but didn’t. I hate that when I sleep my dad purposely face me and act as if he’s sleeping and make me uncomfortable. I hate that he can see me on “find my friend”. I hate that I choose not to do drugs or drink and when I know I could do it make me happier. I hate that I want to kill myself, but choose not to without a reason. I hate that I hate myself. I hate that I feel so lonely all the time. I hate that my biggest fear is to be forgotten, but so many have already forgotten me. I hate how I can’t cook for myself, have parties for myself, or do anything for my self without my dad interfering. I had how my stray cat Miss Fortune has a collar a few months ago and now doesn’t show up to my house. I hate how I tried to treat the cat the best that I could, and miss her. I hate how I want to cry again. I hate how my dad is coughing blood but hasn’t told the real reason why. I hate how he interrupted my rant. I hate that I share a room with him and he touches my stuff all the time. I hate how he stay in our living room for a long time so that I don’t go out when he comes in to sleep. I hate that I have to stay in the living room late at night to that I can feel free. I hate that he doesn’t tell me our financial situation and pretend that everything is fine.

I should just buy some more weed. No reason to go without. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wish I had a gun and felt confident around guns. I just imagine, what if I had a nice little sawed-off? To sit here, on this comfy sofa, with the comfort and warmth of the rich vodka in my belly; to close my eyes and find peace, point my deliverance in the right direction, and pull the trigger on the eternal, resting peace which we are all guaranteed; to just bask in that rest forever, not having to think about anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would be true peace.&lt;/p&gt;

*i told a friend today that I wanted to die after a few hints and her continuing to be mean to me she put the little heart emoji on the text of a sad bitmoji then I sent a picture of my YouTube searches (I want to die) and said bet you won’t love that picture and she did","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It fucks me up, I’m a guy and I was raised not to talk about my feelings.

I'll be honest, I hadn't quite figured it out before I got depressed, but depression sure made sure I locked down that confusion and didn't go anywhere with it. Am I straight? Who knows.

Then you add in depression just killing your sex drive overall. I can't speak for anybody else but damn, depression doesn't kill my sex drive. It kills any attempt to go out and meet people and try to get a relationship or fling going, but it doesn't kill your sex drive. So it just turns into me staying at home rubbing one out literally just to force my early 20s hormones to just chill for a second. Any kinks I have have slowly dissolved into a puddle of ""meh"" and stuff I would've died to have done to me before depression hit just seem like another item.

Any kinks I have have slowly dissolved into a puddle of &amp;quot;meh&amp;quot; and stuff I would&amp;#39;ve died to have done to me before depression hit just seem like another item. It&amp;#39;s such a weird thing seeing everyone else with sexual interests and clear turnons when you don&amp;#39;t really have any anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just tired of it, I want to go back to feeling normal and feeling like I had myself figured out.&lt;/p&gt;

Hope you all had a great weekend! This is one of the few posts I’ve made to reddit, so I apologize if I’m making errors with how I address this, but I was hoping to gather some advice from people with more experience than I have. I was originally put on Wellbutrin about a year ago for my anxiety, (idk what they were thinking lmao), but I quit taking it about 6 months ago due to a mental fog I feel like I developed and also a grand mal seizure! (Although I did do heavy drinking the night before, I know. Big no no. I was otherwise sober for the treatment). But the honeymoon phase was phenomenal for me. I found a new love for life I never knew I could have. Since coming off of it, I’ve had some life changing events that furthered my pre-existing mild depression into a severe one which I’m having a harder time coping with each day. Nothing brings joy, sex drive is chatting with satan in hell’s depths, I feel terribly unwanted, and I’ve lost this charming confidence I used to be praised for. The seizure thing is obviously the biggest draw back from maybe trying it again, but I really think that it made me a better, and happier person.  I’d like to talk to my doctor about this and figure out an optimal method of addressing this, but I’m worried of having my drivers license stripped away, or being blacklisted from using it regardless of my misuse with alcohol the night before the seizure.  


Additional info I may have skipped:
-I was on 150mg for two months before being bumped to 300mg 

-the seizure occurred about a month and a half after being bumped to 300mg.


-my low sex drive is affecting a potential relationship I’m building with somebody I care very much about (my name on reddit holds no meaning anymore 🥴😪)


-I’m a 23 year old male.


- I have tried Zoloft, but only felt LAZY and the thought of feeling lazy just added to my anxiety / depression :/

For the last 2-3 weeks I've stayed home from school because I can't make myself go without having a sever anxiety attack or a meltdown.

From having a pile of empty water bottles on the floor, to boxes of Halloween decorations for a Halloween party coming up laying around, and I don't put away my clean laundry, my dirty laundry stays in a pile on the floor, and there are four clean sweatshirts sitting on a chest that I didn't hang up.

For 2-3 weeks, I've spent my time in bed. I get up for the bathroom, snacks, and my meals have consisted of Ramen because it's the easiest and fastest thing to eat. I've done nothing but that and overthink about how I'm so pathetic and worthless and I should give up. Why would I bother going to school? I'll fail anyway. What's the point of staying home? I'm just disappointing everyone I know.

I wanna kill myself. I'm a freshman in high school and I keep having vivid images and ideas pop into my head when I'm trying to go to sleep, about hanging myself or swallowing a bunch of pills and dying.

I hate this. I want a hug. But I haven't seen my friends because I haven't been to school. I'm so incredibly touch starved and I just want to cuddle.  But I wanna cry. I wish someone wouldn't tell me how to feel. When I tell someone 'i would rather be dead than go to school', I don't want someone to tell me 'no you don't.""

But that's how I feel. I wish they would stop telling me that it isn't how I feel. Every day I'm thinking about how much better off I'd be to everyone if I didn't exist, or if I was just gone.

I can't wait any longer for my next counseling appointment in two days. I feel like I'm going crazy. I wanna cry all the time but I can't because I feel numb, too. I have to go to school this week, but it's making me wanna throw up even thinking about it. I wish my school would do something for me finally. But I have to wait until my next doctor's appointment to switch meds and stuff like that.

I really don't wanna keep living like this. I wanna be better now. I wanna be happy again. I wanna have a regular sleep schedule again. I don't wanna disappoint anyone anymore. I don't wanna feel worthless anymore.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have anxiety, like, really, really severe anxiety. Along with it came depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so sick of feeling the same two feelings constantly. Either intense anxiety or absolutely nothing at all. I can&amp;#39;t sleep right anymore. When I have panic attacks my ears ring and so my ears are almost constantly ringing. For the last 2-3 weeks I&amp;#39;ve stayed home from school because I can&amp;#39;t make myself go without having a sever anxiety attack or a meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also, for the last 2-3 weeks, my life has been atrocious. From having a pile of empty water bottles on the floor, to boxes of Halloween decorations for a Halloween party coming up laying around, and I don&amp;#39;t put away my clean laundry, my dirty laundry stays in a pile on the floor, and there are four clean sweatshirts sitting on a chest that I didn&amp;#39;t hang up.&lt;/p&gt;

I've tried suicide before and have made multiple suicidal threats and gestures. This is coming from someone who has had every opportunity in the world to succeed and have been lucky enough to have a great supportive family. However I constantly feel like I'm letting them down and myself down with not completing college. I've been in college since I was 17 and am now 26. Throughout my time in college I have failed enough hours to get a second associates degree. I've never felt especially passionate about college or school in general. The only real positive I've had with college is I met my current gf and we have been together for 3 years. While it has been great it has also given me another person to worry about taking care of. I feel like I can't really take care of anyone since I can't really take care of myself anymore. I have a really bad back and hip from my time in the Air Force and it has led me to believe I can't physically do much. I've been stuck in a loophole with the AF for over 3 years about my status and I haven't even begun the process with the VA because my unit hardly knows I exist. i try to frequently call and email them on a bi daily basis and I either get no response or the same generic response of "" we're waiting on this"". With all of this in mind I feel pressured that I have to get an education to be successful. Personally I don't believe a bachelors degree guarantees me success. But since I can't stand for more than 15 minutes and am not physically active I have no idea what to do. I help all the people I can around me when it comes to pursuing their dreams and goals and they are out achieving them. While I'm very glad that they're pursuing their happiness I can't help but feel left behind. I've gone to multiple therapists and it almost always goes the same with generic responses and the feeling of them not caring. I had a therapist for 3 years that helped me get through some bad issues in the past that abandoned me when I threatened suicide a couple months ago and got detained by police and taken to a mental health clinic. He had to go on vacation and he would talk to me in a couple weeks time. After that I just don't trust people anymore with my feelings besides my gf. She's currently in basic training and I don't get to talk to her besides letters. I'm afraid that if I talk about how I truly feel then I will get sent back to that mental hell hole and rot away. Lately I haven't done much. I take my dog out on walks and make sure he's happy. Bought some groceries for a friend that I hadn't seen in a couple months. And I just laze around playing video games until 7 or 8am. I have other friends spend time with each other without me because I probably suck being around. Last time I was with them we went bar hopping and into a club, which I'm terribly afraid of, had a mental breakdown and that was that. I know this post has a lot of back and forth in it, but this is how my mind is right now. The only time I feel comfort and peace of mind is when I play video games. I get to be the funny outrovert guy that I can be and have a great time with some old friends I've been with for a long time and make new friends. I guess this is a bi product of the kid who had the silver spoon in his mouth growing up. I thought I had gotten over my laziness after completing basic training and going back to school after a break. But I've come back full circle feeling like a complete loser. I have no idea what to do or where to even start. If I'm being completely honest all I want is to have my dog, gf, video games, and time with the family. I don't care about what job I have. But at the same time I want to find a career I'm passionate about and that won't hurt my back or hip anymore.

I think about ending my life an increasing amount. I fear I will not last till the end of the year. I don&amp;#39;t know how any of this Reddit stuff works but here it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t know what to do anymore, or how to even keep going. This last year and especially last few months, have been horrible.... I really don’t know why I’m here anymore or why I even try to keep going. I was kicked out of home by family, because I, a white male, have fallen in love with a black girl( who is my world, and as you will see, will never be backseat to anyone or choice I make). I asked her to move in with me after we dated for a few months (4-5) and she said yes. We had been living together for almost a year when my family (Gma owns the property, I own the house) pretty much forced me to move out because, instead of coming to me like adults, they went to my gma and bitched and loaned etc, until I made the choice for her. She is extremely old, had stints in her legs, takes blood thinning meds, and suffers from stress, due ofc to family. I moved to avoid causing her anymore pain and hospital visits... After we moved, she asked if she could take time for herself, to figure out what she wants to do and also figure out a few other things. I said ok because I want her to be happy and if that is what does it, then I will. I miss her and have not slept well without her since, and it’s been hard. After that, I lost my job due to a conniving co worker. I really started struggling then..., When I lived back home, I payed for both mine and my cousins power bills.  After I moved, they broke into my house and stole a lot of very expensive computer and gaming equipment, as well as very sentimental things I had not been able to get moved yet. My gpa was the father I didn’t have, and he taught me many things... he is also why I got into gaming.  He brought me an nes with Mario/duck hunt and the zapper when I was barely able to hold a controller. Took me fishing, arrow head hunting, swimming, etc. The things he left me, I cherish them. On top of that, they stole the money I had saved up and I couldn’t prove any of it, I knew it was them. I yielded that because there was nothing to be done and besides my gma and mother, my family has nothing to do with me. I’m not like them at all, Interest and personality. I was expected to keep paying their bill.... are you fucking stupid??? So when I said that, they pretty much made it where I can no longer visit my gma, because after a fistfight in her yard with my cousin and uncle, they have told me that they will call the cops on me if I ever set foot there again,.. so now where I grew up is completely off limits as is my gma. So I’m where I am now, but alone. I have asked my mother for help, but she can’t really do anything as she’s currently going through an issue my stepfathers old job caused with their income. Something about him accidentally earning too much that last year before he retired. The woman I love though, she still sees me everyday. Take her to work, bring her home, to the store, etc. Despite how far I have fallen..... she still wants to be around me, and tries to help me when she can... she cooks for me and buys food sometimes, gives me gas money, and spends time with me. I have found a new job but it’s only 3-6 hours a week at minimum wage.... What she does for me.... even with everything going on with her mom and sister, lots of stress from there because her mom has had to be watched due to an accident, and her sister dumps her 2 kids off on them and takes off all the time. I guess I’m trying to say that it brings me to tears.... I want to help her and make her happy as I know she’s struggling with all the stress her job and home life put on her... I honestly thought about Cutting ties with her and moving w/o saying anything, because I feel like I’m a source of stress to her as well. I love her so much, and I had thought about proposing to her, I still do.... I never have felt the amount of love and care in my life for anyone, even myself, EVER.... before her. I thought I’d go through life alone, and I was ok with that.... until I met her. Suddenly , I feel things for someone else... I cared and still do, about my gma and mother, and I’ve been in a few relationships in the past, but they were only a few months and it was mostly sex ,eating together,and just hanging out.  When those relationships split and we were just friends ( except one who was very bitter over a few things) it did not hang over me, like I was missing something. I didn’t feel much really, I enjoyed being with them and around them, but if they weren’t there, no loss. Her, it’s been different.  Before I asked her to move in, which I never did with anyone else, I started feeling...  things for her. I tend to over think things and yes... I’m stupid because I try to analyze love, and I have never felt the way she made and still does, make me feel. I love her, I truly do. For the first time in my life, I started thinking about what someone else wanted before I got something I wanted. I did and still do what I can for people I care about, but with her, I really care when I do those things. I think about her before myself, and if I can make her happy, there isn’t a cost that is to high. She means everything to me, and as I said before, I thought about leaving for here as well, despite not really being in the best circumstance to do it.... I have suffered and dealt with so much this last year. And have even had my phone cut off.... yet she still wants me to take her to work, be around her, and treat me to food, and even bought me some clothes for my new job...  I just don’t want to be a ball and chain to her.... I feel like I’m hurting her just being here, and I can’t stand it.... We aren’t together, and I don’t know if we ever will get back together.... but I want her to be happy, safe, successful and comfortable. I pushed her through cosmetology school and she has since gotten a job at a stylist place and she’s doing amazing there,  and she’s happy there with the people she works with. I just feel like I’m the last memory of a time maybe better forgotten.... She suffers from self image problem, and thinks she’s ugly.    It breaks my heart to hear her say those things.... I wish I could show her how amazing she looks to me, to everyone else.... she is the most beautiful,smart, hard working, attitude giving woman, PERSON, I have ever met. There is no one else for me out there, no other woman even gets my attention.... there has been a few times where I’ve been flirted with and straight asked out, but I just couldn’t do it. We aren’t dating now, but it felt and thinking now, still feels like betrayal.... She is the one I love, I have given my heart to, and she knows this... I just don’t want her feeling like because I feel that way, she should reciprocate. there is tons of guys out there that could do more for her, give her more, take her places, etc... At this  point, I’m a complete failure, and she should avoid me before being dragged down..   I love her more than anything, and I want the best for her, even if it’s not me.... I am sorry for the length of this post, I’m just all over the place with emotions.... trying to keep it to together while I type this, and I guess, to ask others what they think.... What should I do? I do t know anymore.... I’m struggling $ wise,and emotionally... I have no one to talk to anymore. I don’t put any of this in her simply because she already deals with so much. I couldn’t bear to hurt her.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like my title says, I’m drowning...  I don’t know what to do anymore, or how to even keep going.

What she does for me.... even with everything going on with her mom and sister, lots of stress from there because her mom has had to be watched due to an accident, and her sister dumps her 2 kids off on them and takes off all the time. I guess I’m trying to say that it brings me to tears.... I want to help her and make her happy as I know she’s struggling with all the stress her job and home life put on her... I honestly thought about Cutting ties with her and moving w/o saying anything, because I feel like I’m a source of stress to her as well. I love her so much, and I had thought about proposing to her, I still do.... I never have felt the amount of love and care in my life for anyone, even myself, EVER.... before her. I thought I’d go through life alone, and I was ok with that.... until I met her. Suddenly , I feel things for someone else... I cared and still do, about my gma and mother, and I’ve been in a few relationships in the past, but they were only a few months and it was mostly sex ,eating together,and just hanging out.  When those relationships split and we were just friends ( except one who was very bitter over a few things) it did not hang over me, like I was missing something. I didn’t feel much really, I enjoyed being with them and around them, but if they weren’t there, no loss. Her, it’s been different.  Before I asked her to move in, which I never did with anyone else, I started feeling...  things for her. I tend to over think things and yes... I’m stupid because I try to analyze love, and I have never felt the way she made and still does, make me feel. I love her, I truly do. For the first time in my life, I started thinking about what someone else wanted before I got something I wanted. I did and still do what I can for people I care about, but with her, I really care when I do those things. I think about her before myself, and if I can make her happy, there isn’t a cost that is to high. She means everything to me, and as I said before, I thought about leaving for here as well, despite not really being in the best circumstance to do it.... I have suffered and dealt with so much this last year. And have even had my phone cut off.... yet she still wants me to take her to work, be around her, and treat me to food, and even bought me some clothes for my new job...  I just don’t want to be a ball and chain to her.... I feel like I’m hurting her just being here, and I can’t stand it.... We aren’t together, and I don’t know if we ever will get back together.... but I want her to be happy, safe, successful and comfortable. I pushed her through cosmetology school and she has since gotten a job at a stylist place and she’s doing amazing there,  and she’s happy there with the people she works with. I just feel like I’m the last memory of a time maybe better forgotten.... She suffers from self image problem, and thinks she’s ugly.    It breaks my heart to hear her say those things.... I wish I could show her how amazing she looks to me, to everyone else.... she is the most beautiful,smart, hard working, attitude giving woman, PERSON, I have ever met. There is no one else for me out there, no other woman even gets my attention.... there has been a few times where I’ve been flirted with and straight asked out, but I just couldn’t do it. We aren’t dating now, but it felt and thinking now, still feels like betrayal.... She is the one I love, I have given my heart to, and she knows this... I just don’t want her feeling like because I feel that way, she should reciprocate. there is tons of guys out there that could do more for her, give her more, take her places, etc... At this  point, I’m a complete failure, and she should avoid me before being dragged down..   I love her more than anything, and I want the best for her, even if it’s not me.... I am sorry for the length of this post, I’m just all over the place with emotions.... trying to keep it to together while I type this, and I guess, to ask others what they think.... What should I do? I do t know anymore.... I’m struggling $ wise,and emotionally... I have no one to talk to anymore. I don’t put any of this in her simply because she already deals with so much. I couldn’t bear to hurt her.&lt;/p&gt;

I can’t really imagine myself doing anything else, at the same time I can no longer imagine myself doing it. I’ve become a mostly absent minded, unmotivated person. Can’t really think critically, the only thing I can think about is depression, regret, and suicide. Can’t pay attention in class, college is killing me. All I want to do is sleep everyday away, have not been keeping in classes. I don’t know how I’m still going to class.

Speaking of college I might have fucked myself. I transferred colleges, from a known good school to another school. The justification was the commute, almost 2 hours each way. This school is only an hour. Was the education program there good? Yeah. Is the education program here good? I don’t know. I hear regardless all education courses are mostly useless. There was bullshit there I didn’t want to deal with and now bullshit here I don’t want to deal with. I felt more at home there, here everything feels foreign. I think if I stayed I wouldn’t be happy, and now I’m here and I’m not happy. It might have been the right choice all things considered, but I simply cannot live with my decisions. Doesn’t help that I made that decision when I was in a terrible mindset.

Back to absent mindedness. Some of the time when I talk I don’t know what the fuck I’m talking about. Like words come out of my mouth and I’m like wtf am I saying. I don’t feel connected to what I am saying. I have trouble speaking in general, timidness and voice cracks and occasional slurring which in turn makes me more timid. I have trouble explaining things. Which is not a good quality to have if you’re trying to become a teacher. I cannot process things well and most of the time have nothing to say.

Official diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder, though I’m not sure. I’m now on my 7th therapist and 3rd psychiatrist. The new psych described my case as complex, and me as strange but not weird. Funny thing, he asked me what school I go to. I told him which school I go to, he never heard of it, and I told him what school I used to go to. First thing he asked is if I regretted it. Great. He wants me on lithium, lamictal isn’t working. I’m honestly excited for it, he says it should improve my mood and stop my suicidal thoughts, which is what I’m struggling with heavily. I tried to kill myself a month ago, ended up in a psych ward. Felt at home there, now out and I’m miserable. I don’t want to be here, I’m running on fumes for college. I can’t continue like this much longer, otherwise I’ll fuck up this semester and my entire future. If I have a future. Everything seems so pointless and hopeless. I’ve spent most of my life depressed, had three breakdowns, one psychotic, within a little over a year with two suicide attempts, out of four suicide attempts total in my life, and am trying to avert another crisis. All while trying to become part of a profession that requires a lot of work, motivation, energy, stability, competency,  nuance, and tact, all of which I lack. And a constant drive for self improvement. Which I do not have to improve myself as a person, so how am I supposed to do that for an intensive field? That is if I can even get fucking certified in the first place.

I'm new to reddit, but I feel like I need some serious help. I've been dating this guy I met in college for over a year. He's 25. He suffers from depression and anxiety but has refused to get help since he was first diagnosed. It comes in waves every two or three months or so and this wave is definitely the worst one. It's tied to being unemployed for several months after graduating college.

He's becoming more and more withdrawn as he doesn't have money to get out of the house. I pay for him to go out sometimes (I get payed well) but it embarrasses him. He still refuses help, especially now that he would have to ask his mom (whom he lives with) to pay for it. I really want to help him, but he's always insisted that he can help himself and I being there when he needs me is enough. But I've 'been there' for over a year now and I really want to know what I can do beyond that to make him feel better. I've been thinking about telling his mom, but he doesn't want his mom to worry. I probably would if he admitting to feeling suicidal, but it hasn't gotten there, yet. (thank goodness)

I just want to vent for a little bit.

I'm so sick of appearing as non-existent to everyone. People around my age are in stable relationships or are already getting married and having kids. I can't even say I have 1 friend. I've no one to talk to. The only friendship I've had in my life in middle school I recently realized to have been toxic, but at the time it was all I had. Now, I have nothing. I didn't make any friends in high school, so I thought maybe I would in college. I'm halfway through college and I have no friends still. I've tried so hard over the last few years to befriend people and nothing ever came out of it; I always got ignored. In high school, I invited the entire class for my birthday and had like a huge table reserved, but only 1 person showed up. Been celebrating alone at home since because no one ever remembers my birthday anymore or cares. I've been so afraid of being alone for the rest of my life, but now I feel like that's coming true. I never leave the house unless I have to go to class or get something else done. Every time I try to connect with someone, I just feel out of place. I keep telling myself maybe in the future at the workplace I'd be able to make a friend, but at this point I know it's not gonna happen. I feel like I'm not compatible with anyone. No one ever remembers me anymore and it just hurts getting ignored all the time. I've been trying to open up to people lately but I keep getting shit on by people so I guess I'm just gonna go back to being closed off and emotionless. Not that it worked great last time, but I don't really have much of an option. This whole year has been a bust, I've hardly done anything. I feel like I've improved in a lot of aspects, but on nights like these it just comes down crashing back to me. I don't know if anything's changed for the better, but I'm clearly doing something wrong when I have nobody in my life that I talk to anymore. I've never been close to my family either, I've always felt some kind of disconnection between us, and I don't see myself being close to them ever because they've always shut me off whenever I'd talk about something I'm going through so I feel like no one really understands me anymore. Many years ago I would've wanted things like money and a big house but now I just want a single friend. It's sad when I feel like even something as small as that is not in the cards for me. Everything I do to do improve, no one notices. On top of that I keep getting told I'm wasting my time on useless things for hobbies I actually like and learn from. I wish I could disappear because I know no one would notice. Hell, as of late, I've hardly been able to feel anything at all myself. I'm just empty inside, waiting for the next day to come, go to class and get back. Repeat. I don't feel loved by anybody and everyone is just so much better than me. I honestly hope it doesn't come true, but right now I do see myself living like this for the rest of my life, alone and all that. I could kill myself right now and I know no one would even notice besides my parents just because they live with me. I see so many people and their friends showing them so much love and always being around them but that's never happened to me. I don't have anyone to lean onto and just cry. I really want to hug someone but I've got no one. It's so sad that I had this dream of kissing this random person, but didn't feel anything, then I asked for a hug instead and it felt so amazing. I don't know when's the last time I've hugged someone like that. Even one person being nice to me can make my day, but every time I enter a new circle, I try my best to interact with people and befriend them and just end up getting ignored very quickly. The next day, everyone is already somehow magically best friends with each other and they talk about everything, and tell each other how much they love each other, meanwhile I have like 1 contact saved on my phone. I don't get why I would be even alive anymore, there's just no point to it. I'm just skimming through life without feeling anything or being with anyone. I know no one cares about me or loves me, but I wish it were otherwise. I just want to feel loved for once. But no one even notices me or what I'm going through. I want a friend I can talk to about everyday stuff, play games with, go out and have fun or just do nothing but chill, but I know it's never going to happen. As far as relationships or getting married, that has absolutely no chance of ever occurring because I'm not very attractive in my opinion and I'd probably get dumped quickly. I work out at home because I'm anxious to go to the gym because I think everybody will stare at me for not looking as good as I probably should be looking at this age. And even when I work out a lot, my family and people at school/college have kept reminding me about how much I should work out instead of not doing anything with my life and get a girlfriend. So it doesn't matter what I do or how hard I try, people will always see negative things about me. No one ever appreciates me or what I do, and even when I try to talk about things I like I always get ""uh-huh,"" and the conversation ends there. Now, I understand not being interested in what I like, that's totally understandable. But what I mean is, often times people will just make me feel like I'm dumb for liking something and that's it's useless. I just want to give up at this point with all the things I've liked and done because I'm just not getting anywhere. I just want to die and get this over with already. I used to be religious, but then gave up on it, but now what with having no one else to turn to, I sometimes feel like resorting to God again if it meant getting some things off my chest, but I don't know man... I'm not sure if I'm even worth saving at this point. I know I probably sound like an idiot, but I'm just tired of dealing with depression for almost a decade now. I'm just straight up worthless. I probably should've taken one out of the many chances I've had of killing myself in high school, but I didn't, hoping it'd get better one day... except it never did. I'm just so hurt and fed up with everything.

Anyway, sorry for rambling. At this point I don't even know what I'm saying, but I'm open to talk to anyone if someone's up for it. If not, whatever. All good.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know no one&amp;#39;s gonna see this, let alone read through it, but whatever. I just want to vent for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s so sad that I had this dream of kissing this random person, but didn&amp;#39;t feel anything, then I asked for a hug instead and it felt so amazing. I don&amp;#39;t know when&amp;#39;s the last time I&amp;#39;ve hugged someone like that. Even one person being nice to me can make my day, but every time I enter a new circle, I try my best to interact with people and befriend them and just end up getting ignored very quickly. The next day, everyone is already somehow magically best friends with each other and they talk about everything, and tell each other how much they love each other, meanwhile I have like 1 contact saved on my phone. I don&amp;#39;t get why I would be even alive anymore, there&amp;#39;s just no point to it. I&amp;#39;m just skimming through life without feeling anything or being with anyone. I know no one cares about me or loves me, but I wish it were otherwise. I just want to feel loved for once. But no one even notices me or what I&amp;#39;m going through. I want a friend I can talk to about everyday stuff, play games with, go out and have fun or just do nothing but chill, but I know it&amp;#39;s never going to happen. As far as relationships or getting married, that has absolutely no chance of ever occurring because I&amp;#39;m not very attractive in my opinion and I&amp;#39;d probably get dumped quickly. I work out at home because I&amp;#39;m anxious to go to the gym because I think everybody will stare at me for not looking as good as I probably should be looking at this age. And even when I work out a lot, my family and people at school/college have kept reminding me about how much I should work out instead of not doing anything with my life and get a girlfriend. So it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what I do or how hard I try, people will always see negative things about me. No one ever appreciates me or what I do, and even when I try to talk about things I like I always get &amp;quot;uh-huh,&amp;quot; and the conversation ends there. Now, I understand not being interested in what I like, that&amp;#39;s totally understandable. But what I mean is, often times people will just make me feel like I&amp;#39;m dumb for liking something and that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s useless. I just want to give up at this point with all the things I&amp;#39;ve liked and done because I&amp;#39;m just not getting anywhere. I just want to die and get this over with already. I used to be religious, but then gave up on it, but now what with having no one else to turn to, I sometimes feel like resorting to God again if it meant getting some things off my chest, but I don&amp;#39;t know man... I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;m even worth saving at this point. I know I probably sound like an idiot, but I&amp;#39;m just tired of dealing with depression for almost a decade now. I&amp;#39;m just straight up worthless. I probably should&amp;#39;ve taken one out of the many chances I&amp;#39;ve had of killing myself in high school, but I didn&amp;#39;t, hoping it&amp;#39;d get better one day... except it never did. I&amp;#39;m just so hurt and fed up with everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, sorry for rambling. At this point I don&amp;#39;t even know what I&amp;#39;m saying, but I&amp;#39;m open to talk to anyone if someone&amp;#39;s up for it. If not, whatever. All good.&lt;/p&gt;

Tl;dr - I get overwhelmed sometimes over seemingly silly things  and internally say to myself that I want to kill myself/I should just die. No depression diagnosis. Is this how the path to suicide starts, should I seek a diagnosis and should I be worried



I (F) am in my mid-twenties. Growing up I was never talked to about depression, anxiety, or really any of my feelings. I was very moody around age 10 basically until now and my parents never really helped me figure out why and instead thought I was just being whiny and “too old” to act how I was, and often blamed my friends and tried to get my school to do something. I never did anything bad besides yell at my parents a lot. I did relatively OK in school.
I was also bullied for a few years about my weight, skin, and kind of weird clothes. Since then I’ve always felt kind of socially awkward with very low self-esteem and feel like I’m judged everywhere I go.
So basically I just grew up thinking something was just seriously wrong with me for being so mad all the time and I was the only one like that.
Fast forward to college and I had one year where I was not doing well at all. I talked to my parents about seeing a therapist and they really looked at me like I was insane and said “you’re not going on medication” and that was that. I ended up seeking a therapist at my school and never told them. 

Now I’m a little older and understand how the world works a little better. I see my own therapist. We talk a lot about my continued low-self esteem and very obvious anxiety. I always thought anxiety was something “other people had” but it’s definitely what I experience and it was just never talked about.
One time I did bring up depression with my therapist and she kind of brushed it off because she doesn’t like it as a defining term. I really kind of want to see a psychiatrist to know if somethings wrong on a chemical level.
The reasons for this post is....whenever I feel like I say something stupid or am causing issues, I really say to myself “I want to kill myself” or “I should just die” and start thinking about ways to do it, but not seriously.
Last night, this happened and I stared to wonder if this is how a path to suicide really starts and if I should be scared about not addressing my thoughts. I haven’t told my therapist in fear of it coming off as just being dramatic.
Recently I found myself hitting my forehead with my hand after an embarrassing moment, and I did this for a few days. I have no other history of self-harm besides binge eating.

Anyways, I’m looking for clarity on what I’m feeling. I can get up in the morning but also have daily “I want to die” thoughts”. I’m wondering if my confusion is due to never being able to name my feelings as a child, and always being yelled at for being upset.
What is it really like when you see a psychiatrist?

It’s raining, thunder and lightning, the ocean roaring and crashing wildly

I’m barely hanging off of the slide of a cliff, below me a deep drop into the abyss

I struggle to pull myself up, ahead of me, the only real people in my life, friends, and family that actually care, the people I live for, the people I would never dream of hurting

They're smiling at me, encouraging words, cliche talks, they don’t know what's wrong, they look at me and see the person I pretend to be, the mask

I look back down, as the storm in the background picks up in intensity

The abyss looks inviting, it promises release, and escape to the pain, it whispers sweet nothings into my ear promising that it’ll help me

I slowly slide down the edge, my fingers barely holding onto the cliff, I’m too scared to let go, but too tired to hold on

I look back up, My eyes wide, my mind racing, the people I care for, I can’t bring myself to care for them as much as I did before, but I can’t let them go, they won’t let me go. I want to go, but I don’t want to hurt them

However, as I look past them all I see is judgment, discrimination, hostility,

Since moving schools I hadn’t been able to make friends. I’m very quiet. I haven’t joined any clubs and at this point it’s too late to. As sad as it is I daydream about making friends. I sit with a group of people at lunch but I only know one person there. (And not that well) I can’t call those people friends and I don’t expect to make friendships with  them when they’ve known each other for years. I envision this year sucking but I don’t want it to be this way. Someone tell me college will get better. I’m losing motivation in doing the things I like to do. I’ve also noticed I sleep way too much. Like the majority of the time I realize I rather be sleeping. It’s been hard for me to admit it but I have depression. I haven’t told my family yet I’m sure they’d be somewhat supportive. But I’d expect the same rhetoric of “just start a conversation” or “you should’ve joined a club” Any advice&lt;/p&gt;

I spent it alone with my self esteem and worth in the gutter. It was really the first time I was depressed and it was awful. Looking back on my childhood, depression would explain a lot, but it went from a minor nuisance that I had never even picked up on to a life destroying monster that left me spending entire days in bed.

I had friends and family but none of them have ever been close with me. Yeah, I interact with them both but I've never had a real relationship with any of them. My family generally dislikes me and friends have never really supported me in any way beyond casual appreciation. That didn't change until early 2019, when I met somebody new.

Within a week we were together and every day after that was spent madly in love. It was the first time I could open up and feel safe. She struggled with everything I did, so we kept each other afloat for a while and she gave me more than a reason to live. She was perfect and my everything until a few weeks ago.

She broke up with me because she felt a reltionship was stressing her out. We were still on good terms, remaining friends with plans to end up getting back together. Even though I was assured that it was temporary, I sunk back into a depressed state which was now much more severe since I knew what I was missing out on.

Things we fine between us until we got in an argument, I was stressed and venting and upset and I guess I had been doing that too much because she turned on me real quick, calling me toxic and calling out a lot of negative things about me. We're still talking but it's clear that we've hurt each other.

I have never felt more like garbage and it hurts bad. I have hurt coming from every angle. I've lost my friends slowly over the last few years but now, I have absolutely nobody and nothing for support. I hate that I'm back to crying myself to sleep every night and being plagued with nightmares. I hate myself for screwing everything up and being a bad person.

I'm starting to feel numb and tired to anything and I just don't feel like I have it in me to go any further in life. I'm a toxic person and knowing that stings.

To anybody reading this, thanks for letting me vent. I've run out of places to turn but I guess typing into this void helps for now.

Now you're older, preparing yourself to commit to your color full time,

The primary colors in the corner always there

However, as you paint your color grows duller, your paint has dried out

That color no longer has any interest or meaning to you

&amp;#x200B;

You try a couple of other colors you always acknowledged but weren’t overly interested in before

Those colors dry out quickly, you in desperation look to the many tins of color surrounding you, empty,

As you look back to your canvas it’s once again empty but this time you can’t fill it

This time there are no colors

This time you don’t know what to do

This time your lost, sad helpless

But the worst part

No-one can tell anything is wrong when they look at you

&lt;p&gt;When you look at yourself you see an infant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You stick your fingers into random paint tins and get to work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re a child now and unlike before your using a large paintbrush&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canvas is filled with color&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s vibrant and beautiful, something you would only expect from the mind of a child&lt;/p&gt;

I feel like a bit of a fraud. I even had to ""confess"" to my GP that I don't suffer from clinical levels of depression, I'm not suicidal and I'm left with the feeling that I'm cheating the system. He just kind of looked at me with a bit of a smile as if to say ""I never said you DO suffer from clinical depression."" It's that old story of ""You must be yea dysfunctional in order to complain about it,"" but I've never felt justified in complaining. It's only in the last two years that I have sought a regular GP because I unconsciously believed I was not worth the quality level of care which comes from a person you have built rapport with.

I feel my mind racing to justify my decision to go on anti-depressants, and I have to keep reminding myself that no justification is needed, except that it may be a valuable step in my life. It's so bizarre that I can encourage clients to take this step themselves with no judgement or convoluted decision-making process; however, for myself, I need to wade through waist-deep resistance to the idea which demands justification from me with every step.

I'm learning that thoughts, behaviour and emotion (although heavily influenced by each other) do NOT have to be congruent. I can think one way, feel another, and behave in another yet, and this does not demonstrate dysfunction. It demonstrates flexibility. If I went around believing that these parts of me had to be entirely congruent all the time, that would be rigid, inflexible, and add to my anxiety and depressed mood. It's okay for me to judge myself harshly, we all do. It's okay for me to feel overwhelmed, we all do. It's okay for me to behave in ways radically contrasting these thoughts and emotions.

&lt;p&gt;I feel my mind racing to justify my decision to go on anti-depressants, and I have to keep reminding myself that no justification is needed, except that it may be a valuable step in my life. It&amp;#39;s so bizarre that I can encourage clients to take this step themselves with no judgement or convoluted decision-making process; however, for myself, I need to wade through waist-deep resistance to the idea which demands justification from me with every step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m learning that thoughts, behaviour and emotion (although heavily influenced by each other) do NOT have to be congruent. I can think one way, feel another, and behave in another yet, and this does not demonstrate dysfunction. It demonstrates flexibility. If I went around believing that these parts of me had to be entirely congruent all the time, that would be rigid, inflexible, and add to my anxiety and depressed mood. It&amp;#39;s okay for me to judge myself harshly, we all do. It&amp;#39;s okay for me to feel overwhelmed, we all do. It&amp;#39;s okay for me to behave in ways radically contrasting these thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you have a wonderful day.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m from Colombia. I’ve been leaving in The United States for a year (btw I’m totally legal because I was born here, but I was raised in Colombia). 

Like I said, I’ve been leaving here for a year, and all of my problem got together at the same time.

First of all, In Colombia I couldn’t finish my high school, I just did til 9th grade and a half, I’m 18 years old and when I came here, I really came with good expectation, but it wasn’t like that. 

I couldn’t go to high school because of my age and my level of English, unfortunately when I came here my English wasn’t even at 10%, literally I didn’t know anything about it, but fortunately I’ve been learning,however, it’s been harder than I expected because literally I don’t have friends, and my social life always has been very very good, I’m a outgoing person, very talkative person but the fact that I could go to high school hits me a lot. 

Right know I’m doing my GED which is so stressful because it’s supposed to be that you know “everything” about high school, something that of course, I don’t because I couldn’t even finish in my country and therefore, I had to learn things that I’ve never learned before by myself. At some point when I was studying for my Math Exam. I said to myself, “you can’t do this, you’re not the kind of person for this” I was about to stop and give up. 

When I was born my mother was 14 years old. She was very young to have a son, but here I am. Because of that, my parents were raised me, my grandmother and grandfather. I’m not against my mother, she has provided the economic materials from all my life something that I’m very grateful! But when I came here, I just feel alone, she’s my mother but she doesn’t know how to give me that love that I want, sometimes I just need a few words that make me feel happy again and motivated. It’s difficult teaching yourself. It’s difficult think about my future, I want to be successful, I want to go to university, I have dreams, I study it doesn’t matter what the situation is, but somethings I feel that I can’t do anymore. I broke up with my girlfriend because of the distance, I don’t have the best relationship with my mother. I didn’t even do my high school here, no because I didn’t want to, because they Didn’t let me. 

I want to take my SAT, get my high score, go to college, do my career, but my motivation is not enough. Thanks if you read this.

I think theres just somthing wrong with my brain with me as a person. I've been to the doctors, I've tried the medication. It helps somewhat but I still don't feel great about myself.

&lt;p&gt;My partner knows I struggle with mental health but I dont often share when I&amp;#39;m feeling low because as I said before it can be randomly in the middle of having a good time I dont want to constantly kill any happiness we have together by proclaiming I feel like shit, i want her to have a good time that&amp;#39;s my priority. She also struggles her self when she feels down she doesn&amp;#39;t have the ability to function and put on a mask so I feel like it&amp;#39;s up to me to be the strong one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing makes me happy, if it does it&amp;#39;s extremely fleeting.&lt;/p&gt;

Because his opinion of this person is so strong he's been trying to gaslight me , somehow telling me that what I feel and what I went through isn't real, despite his own friends confirming that as well as several other people around. The thing is he wouldn't ask anyone when I told him that all the proof he needs is in anyone else's account of the matter because their perception will match up with mine, making it clear that I'm not the crazy one.

I feel like a total asshole for being depressed a lot. My life is wasted on me. I have a whole bunch of minor health issues that I obsess about, but nothing debilitating. I'm not very happy with my looks but I'm told I'm handsome. And I'm quite tall, which means that in return for back/knee pain I get taken more seriously. I have really bad ADHD but I'm good enough at my job to make a decent living. And I live in a country that is currently doing quite well.

Someone could probably take all that and be a happy, successful person with a meaningful life. Somehow that's not me. I spend my nights and weekends at home playing videogames while watching TV. I'm introverted and socially awkward, so I find it difficult to meet new people - usually I don't even know where to begin. I've stopped doing online dating because it either makes my depression worse, or I get on an emotional rollercoaster that quickly derails and then I take a bunch of innocent women with me down the abyss. It's like treating a migraine with heroin.

For years I was avoiding exercise because I thought it was making me sick.

Now that my depression is getting worse again and I'm old enough for a mid-life-crisis, there has been an interesting development though: some of my anxieties are getting overpowered by a sense of desperation. If I get sick from exercise, then what? I'm currently getting sick because of lack of exercise. And some socially awkward situations might actually distract me from being depressed. Plus, the times in my life when I've been stressed also happened to be the ones when I felt most alive.

I've always thought that before my depression becomes terminal, I'll first try all the things I've been too scared to try. After all, what do I have to lose? I realize that this only works during the ""desperate"" phases of a depression, and not necessarily during the ""unmotivated"" ones, so I better make any tiny bit of motivation count.

The thing that has worked kinda well recently: hiking. It started out with me getting drunk (which I rarely do) and going out into the woods at night, in total darkness.

Here it goes... 

I was leading an exciting, successful life up till the age of about 26. I'm 29 now and really scared for my future. I feel like I've missed my chance to live my full potential. Each day I loose a little more faith that I'm capable of doing anything anymore. I think I need to give up my dreams. It's like that poem about two paths, where the author takes the one less trodden. Well I did the same, and now I'm totally fucking lost, with nobody about to ask directions, and even if I did get back to that fork, it would just mean taking the path I had no interest in in the first place. It would be like accepting an early death. The things that made me love life are fading, and I am very scared that in a few years, I'll have nothing but memories.

Some context:

I have been obsessed with storytelling all my life. I've been working hard to make a career out of it (as a filmmaker, photographer, writer). In my early 20s I felt ahead of the curve, living the dream. I saw great things ahead of me. When I was in my early 20s I started a community of creatives, and from that a huge number of opportunities opened up for me. I took those opportunities - seeing things and doing things that would sound unbelievable if I shared them all here. I also met a girl and together we chased the sun and the next wild adventure. I went about collecting experiences.

Around 25 I sunk my soul into a project that eventually I finished 2 years later. I was proud and hopeful, but the world didn't receive my film the way I hoped and I felt totally defeated. Around the same time I got a job at small company. It was miserable and I was taken advantage of, and that crushed my spirit even further. And then myself and my partner broke up. It was sad but necessary - paradoxically, a loving decision for us both.

From then till now, I still had a few adventures. One satisfying project has kept me going in the last few months, but something in me broke. I can no longer write. I can no longer find the will to create. I am self-employed but slowly losing any passion in what I am doing. I have stopped believing in myself. I started taking more and more drugs. Weeks and months and years are slipping by. I watched many of my friends find 'sensible' paths, get married or find their way somehow. I am increasingly lost, increasingly alone. My mind is suffering from abuse of cannabis. My joy of living has festered into bastardised solitude. I have slipped into deep depression.

Today I don't know if I have the will to go on. I know I must change something. Perhaps it is to accept that my dream of telling stories for a living will never come to be. Perhaps I need to find a sensible job, and be content with whatever place the world has for me. It feels so wrong and so necessary to admit that I might have failed. I might have to give up. That maybe all those people who doubted me when I was younger and full of fire, were right. That the wild drive I had years ago was just a thing of youth. 

I have no mentors. My friends are scattered. I work alone for the most part. I think about suicide more often than I care to admit. I cannot write. I do not take photos. I only make advertising videos. The last few years I've picked myself up from failure so many times, and I don't know how many more set-backs I can take. Time is falling away from me and yet I am still here, in this cold, quiet room, where the last years have escaped me. I can't seem to get a job, even as a trainee, in the field I truly want to work. I've set so many plates spinning it is hard to keep track of them all, and they are falling. My hard fought, small business, is suffering from my own indifference. I do not believe in myself anymore. I am in a relationship I feel is doomed to fail, and feel guilty for thinking that.

I cannot organise myself. I cannot motivate myself. I cannot wake up in the morning and I cannot sleep at night. I feel like nobody understands me. I feel like friends and family are waiting for me to give up on my crazy dreams and rejoin society as a normal human being. 

But I am not normal. Everything good in my life has come from embracing my will to be and do different. To give up now would mean starting again, somewhere at the bottom, in a world that is now totally alien to me. The pressure of my ruthless independence has become a prison.

I've quit weed (for the second time this year). I'm forcing myself away from the dark hole of internet browsing where I lost myself in recent years.  I even wrote a few pages today, but I'm not sure for what. Self-employment means I can't stop, or rest, or take stock, without my business failing. I've looked for jobs and I'm willing to take the cut in freedom and pay, to not be so damn alone for a little while, and to be around people who inspire me. But so far I can't get those jobs. I'm starting to think I'm unlikable to potential employers. I hate advertising yet it's all I do. I want to tell stories that mean something beyond a product.

Disaster is looming. The little I have today, I could loose, if I don't get my life together. I don't know where to start, or how.

Thats my story. I don't know if anyone can help, but I just want to put it out there. Thanks for reading.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is long but I&amp;#39;ve got to get this off my chest. &lt;/p&gt;

I went about collecting experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 25 I sunk my soul into a project that eventually I finished 2 years later. I was proud and hopeful, but the world didn&amp;#39;t receive my film the way I hoped and I felt totally defeated. Around the same time I got a job at small company. It was miserable and I was taken advantage of, and that crushed my spirit even further. And then myself and my partner broke up. It was sad but necessary - paradoxically, a loving decision for us both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From then till now, I still had a few adventures. One satisfying project has kept me going in the last few months, but something in me broke. I can no longer write. I can no longer find the will to create. I am self-employed but slowly losing any passion in what I am doing. I have stopped believing in myself. I started taking more and more drugs. Weeks and months and years are slipping by. I watched many of my friends find &amp;#39;sensible&amp;#39; paths, get married or find their way somehow. I am increasingly lost, increasingly alone. My mind is suffering from abuse of cannabis. My joy of living has festered into bastardised solitude. I have slipped into deep depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I don&amp;#39;t know if I have the will to go on. I know I must change something. Perhaps it is to accept that my dream of telling stories for a living will never come to be. Perhaps I need to find a sensible job, and be content with whatever place the world has for me. It feels so wrong and so necessary to admit that I might have failed. I might have to give up. That maybe all those people who doubted me when I was younger and full of fire, were right. That the wild drive I had years ago was just a thing of youth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no mentors. My friends are scattered. I work alone for the most part. I think about suicide more often than I care to admit. I cannot write. I do not take photos. I only make advertising videos. The last few years I&amp;#39;ve picked myself up from failure so many times, and I don&amp;#39;t know how many more set-backs I can take. Time is falling away from me and yet I am still here, in this cold, quiet room, where the last years have escaped me. I can&amp;#39;t seem to get a job, even as a trainee, in the field I truly want to work. I&amp;#39;ve set so many plates spinning it is hard to keep track of them all, and they are falling. My hard fought, small business, is suffering from my own indifference. I do not believe in myself anymore. I am in a relationship I feel is doomed to fail, and feel guilty for thinking that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot organise myself. I cannot motivate myself. I cannot wake up in the morning and I cannot sleep at night. I feel like nobody understands me. I feel like friends and family are waiting for me to give up on my crazy dreams and rejoin society as a normal human being. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am not normal. Everything good in my life has come from embracing my will to be and do different. To give up now would mean starting again, somewhere at the bottom, in a world that is now totally alien to me. The pressure of my ruthless independence has become a prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve quit weed (for the second time this year). I&amp;#39;m forcing myself away from the dark hole of internet browsing where I lost myself in recent years.  I even wrote a few pages today, but I&amp;#39;m not sure for what. Self-employment means I can&amp;#39;t stop, or rest, or take stock, without my business failing. I&amp;#39;ve looked for jobs and I&amp;#39;m willing to take the cut in freedom and pay, to not be so damn alone for a little while, and to be around people who inspire me. But so far I can&amp;#39;t get those jobs. I&amp;#39;m starting to think I&amp;#39;m unlikable to potential employers. I hate advertising yet it&amp;#39;s all I do. I want to tell stories that mean something beyond a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disaster is looming. The little I have today, I could loose, if I don&amp;#39;t get my life together. I don&amp;#39;t know where to start, or how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats my story. I don&amp;#39;t know if anyone can help, but I just want to put it out there. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

I have people around me.

I used to use these imaginary figures to neglect and abuse myself when I was younger in my head it was a separation from myself and my depression/mental health issues.

But I started giving these characters personalities, physical appearances, back stories, basically 'Life' and I know imaginary friends are normal but these weren't. These things were the personification of what I wanted to do to myself.

These things were my escape they also comforted me when I needed someone there for me. They were bipolar in attitude towards me.

I guess I thought once I got out of high school, everything would fall into place. I'll get a job, I'll get better at art, I'll be able to travel and see all my internet friends and get a college degree and be content with life, for once. And I did get a job, for a moment. One of those shitty min wage fast food jobs you'd get while you're in school. I couldn't tell you exactly what it was- the physical pain it caused me, how slow time seemed to drag, how inadequate I felt, how badly my anxiety would flare when dealing with certain people, how I was in so much agony by the time I got home that I couldn't do anything but crawl into bed just to repeat the process the next day- but I quit, a little over three weeks after I started. 

I need to work again. I'm still living with my mom, and she's barely able to pay the bills (my father passed away years ago, and her new husband barely helps at all). But it's this nagging thought in the back of my head- I'll find a way to fuck it up again, somehow. Or I'll never find time to pursue my hobbies. I'll become a zombie, working day in, day out, never making time to do anything else or meet people or unwind long enough to feel anything other than stress.

 I'm not really getting any support from my mother- she's really just pressing me about it all, and I realize she may have good intentions, but the pressure she puts on me does nothing to change the situation. I want to help her- I want to have money regardless- but I can't get out of this mindframe that the second I fall in line, everything else will fall apart. I am slowly sabotaging myself by letting every opportunity that presents itself pass me by, and every day is a cycle of waking up, looking through job listings, and then feeling guilt later on when I ultimately end up on my computer doing anything else to distract myself from how I failed the entire day by not doing a damn thing. 

My boyfriend insists that I have time, that I'm young, that I'll find something eventually. I want to believe it's true, that he's right. But my mother won't let it go- it's the same question every day, and it's always at the forefront of my mind, eating at me. I'm damned if I do, and I'm damned if I don't. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm trying to be an artist, and a musician, but I'm barely able to do either and making money through either of those things is a far off dream, if even that.

&lt;p&gt;I know that I need to just stay to myself and stop trying to talk to people but it is hard. I hate myself but that does not stop me from getting lonely or those random times where I want to be sociable. Honestly it&amp;#39;s like I hate my life and I go back and forth all the time thinking I want to make all these changes and get out of this hole I&amp;#39;ve built, and then I&amp;#39;ll think there&amp;#39;s no point and it would be easier to just not wake up.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure where this post is going, I&amp;#39;m just feeling really alone and depressed and wasn&amp;#39;t sure where else to put my thoughts. Thanks for listening Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm really bad at talking to people and opening up to them. I tell you this because it's really important to understand the situation. 

So back in 2011 I had a crush on a girl. We were close friends, but I started to feel more. I told her, and she rejected me obviously. It really hurt me but we still tried to be friends. It didn't work out well, we stopped talking and caring about each other. I was very depressed because as I told you, It's really hard for me to let people close to me, so obviously losing her was a big trauma. It took me about 2-3 years to fully accept that we are not friends anymore.

But something started again. I started to talk more and more to a girl, we became friends, and then later, best friends. We knew ecerything about each other and we talked every day. Literally every day. It didn't took me long to fall in love. Since he had a boyfriend at that time I kept my feelings to myself, I didn't want to stand between them. All I wanted is her to be happy. And not to mention I didn't want this friendship to result in the same thing as before. It was hard, but I kept it in. Fast forward to february 2016, and she somehow found out that I had feelings for her. She stopped talking to me. One day everything was fine, and the next day she acted like we never knew each other. She didn't even tell me what was going on, but deep down I knew that somehow she found out my secret. I was shocked that I lost another loved one, another friend. I cant tell you how much I've cried, how much I thought about ending my life because I only saw darkness everywhere and I wanted it to end, because the one person that I loved from the bottom of my heart, left me. Some people say that it's even harder to lose a really close friend than a girlfriend/boyfriend. But with a help of a an old friend of mine, after almost 2 years I managed to climb out of this, and I felt good. It was hard, really hard, but I was happy again somehow. 

Fast foward to 2019, I can't believe it, but the same thing seems to be happening AGAIN, for the 3rd time. There is this girl that I got to know over the internet. We started talking, I'm not saying we are close friends, but we talk regularly and I really enjoy her company. After a long time, I met someone that I could possibly open up to. As I said, it's really hard for me, so if I get close to someone it show that the person is really, really important to me and I trust him/her. A couple days ago we were chatting about random stuff, but suddenly she stopped responding to me. I tried to ask her what's up but she didn't answer.  Since then, she doesn't like my pictures (I know it sounds kinda stupid, but she was almost always the first one to put a heart on my posts on FB and Instagram). I don't know what to do now, I don't know what I did wrong, but I'm just so afraid of losing her that I already cried myself to sleep last night. I don't want it to happen to me again, because this time, I'm not sure I'll ever get up. 

Honestly, I'm at a point where I just want to go away to a deserted island and live the rest of my life there. Without people. Just me.

You always told me I had a great singing voice but didn't want to pay for a voice coach and that I would have a lot of spare time while studying in university so I can do all of this stuff. YET YOU ASK ME ALL THE TIME WHY I DO NOT SING ANY MORE.

&amp;#x200B;

The episode started right after i finished and delivered the first big work the company i started a few years ago. The ""event"" was technincally a success. i got a lot of praise and some new clients are rolling in. (or would be if i could bring myself to pick up some calls or reply to some emails) The thing is i was miserable during the process i now (nearly 4 weeks later) i have not been to work once. I feel like shit, i can't focus on anything i'm panicking all the time, crying all the time. but mostly not bearing to move at all. i have inhabited my room quite exclusevely these last couple of weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

The pain of getting the work done even before was enormous. i don't recognize any of it as mine. me having any shred of anything seems like it's just the universe making a mistake. I don't recall much from the weeks leading up to the ""event"" for me it's like i was feeling the exact same, just for some reason back then i had the stregth to push through.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, when i showed up at my therapist 2 days after the ""event"" and described this  he was very surprised. He said i looked genuinely happy the week before, and genuinely happy about having some progression with my work. I argued for a bit, that made no sense to me, i was not well, i don't remember being well. i remember doing stuff but i don't remember ever feeling any better.

i have no idea if that is true.

my close friends were also shocked when i mentioned i was going through a very low moment. nearly the same reaction as my therapist. 

&amp;#x200B;

i don't doubt they are right. i may have been happier for a brief moment. but literally now that everything i worked for the last 2 years is going according to plan. i shut down. This is not the first time this happens. i started and dropped out of college twice before deciding on another life direction. My second time leaving university whithout a degree, the way i remember it i was very suicidal and i felt like if i pushed it any more i'd break and not come out.

&amp;#x200B;

but now learning how i heavily distort things in my mind, i don't know anymore. the people around me at the time don't think i was suffereing at the time. i always dismissed that as me being good at not showing it.

&amp;#x200B;

What if i was ok. and kust snapped once i started getting close to accomplishing anything? 

If i snap, and just so strongly want to die, when i have any perspective of success that i have to completely abandon what i was doing immedeately. what future can i have?

It's not just the business and college. looking back i may have been operating like this my entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i'm here, 25, living with my parents, never had a serious relationship, not a dollar to my name, don't know how to anything well, can't interact with people. I don't have money, i don't know how to work at anything really. i look the worst i have ever looked, i feel like i have just let my youth go by and did nothing with it. now im just getting older and have no perspective.

I don't know what to do. and i'm very tired of trying

&lt;p&gt;the only time i feel comfortable and safe is when i turn my brain off and shelter myself from the outside world. i dont know how i&amp;#39;m going to make it through another year of this. i am always uncomfortable, paranoid and feeling sick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fuck this shit, who else knows what im talking about??&lt;/p&gt;

Backstory: I have been fighting depression for about 10 years now. It's been a rough fight, I had a few suicide attempts a couple of years ago after some bad shit happened. About a year and a half ago my GF got pregnant with my son, I was scared and acted like an asshole but after I came to terms with being a dad in my early 20s she forgave me, I was there for his birth and for the first 6~ months if his life. My son is amazing, the best thing in my life by far. He's the sweetest, happiest little guy ever. This is where things start to go back downhill.

About two months ago my GF decided she was moving back to her home state where my son was born (she moved to my state after he was born for a few months and had been living with me for a year before getting pregnant). She moved because she couldn't get work in my state with her degree and thought she could in her state. I've gone and visited them twice so far but after coming back this time I've been massively depressed that I can't be with my son. 

Now it would be an extremely easy choice for me to drop everything here and move to be with them. But I am still in school and very dependent on my mom as she pays for my school and let's me stay with her since my school is close to her house. I have tried talking to both of them about the situation and how I feel but when I talk to my mom about me moving to be with them she gets very angry and says she will stop paying for my school. When I talk to my GF about coming back she says she doesn't want to be in a state where she can't find a job she likes. 

I feel like a damn coward all the time. I'm too scared to drop out and move to be with my son because I feel I would be stuck in my low paying retail job forever but being away from him is killing me. I haven't been suicidal in years and I know I would never go through with it now that I have my son. I grew up with no Dad and I could never do that to him. But every day I wake up and don't want to be awake, I can barely get out of bed, I'm always angry and sad and terrified of these thoughts that I have. 

I've tried getting appointments with Psychiatrists but none of them return my calls and it just makes me feel worse. I don't know what to do anymore.

Possibly abused

Basically my partner has suffered with depression, social anxiety, PTSD, past physical abuse, suicide attempts and self harming. We met at uni and I isolated myself from friends and family to keep her happy, and threw myself into my degree in a stupid attempt to make it worthwhile. She made me feel guilty for having friends, guilt tripped me into doing countless things I didn't want to do, looked at my phone without permission, interrogated me about girls I knew, and much more I wont bother listing. I never really thought about it as being abusive until I recently had some therapy and my therapist said it sounded like emotional abuse. We finally break up, but a week later, whilst still living together, a family member of her's commits suicide. She leans on me like we are still together, and tells me things like ""I know i'm not suppose to say this, but i still love you"", whilst i'm down with her and her family for support. This week she admitted to feeling suicidal and having strong urges to self harm, whilst making me promise not to tell anyone else. She also told me she self harmed when i went away for a few weeks for a family holiday. I told her she might feel better phoning Samaritans or something and she told me she didn't need to because she was talking to me. She is due to restart some therapy, but refuses to go home and get it back down near her family, because she doesn't want to change therapist. They have offered her therapy here straight away with a different therapist but she wont take it either. I go from thinking it was abuse to thinking i'm a piece of shit for thinking it was. It's real confusing.

Job/Career is a embarrassing

As mentioned before I used my possible abuse as a means to motivate myself to do well at uni. I remember thinking to myself, all this misery will at least be worth it, in some way. Oh how naive and stupid. I did well, and was able to get a full-time graduate job before I even graduated. The pay was pretty crap for a role wanting a graduate (£15,957), and it was really boring, but i was happy to just have a grad job tbh. Fast forward 7-8 months and I have nothing to do at work. I worked through the organisations backlog of clients/enquires and they struggled to give me stuff to do. At the beginning I would ask for extra tasks, but i would just be told to make massive spreadsheets with useless data that would never be touched again or followed up with. So I did my expected tasks which took at most an hour a day and applied for other jobs while at work. After working there for a year, they tell me that they will have to put me down to three days a week due to a lack of funding. It's a charity so it sounds plausible and sadly expected, however when they just recently brought a new piece of film equipment for hundreds of thousands of pounds, and i helped bring in new clients for more than my yearly salary, it felt like a slap in the face. I get nowhere after hundreds of job applications, even after seeking professional help with my CV. I was told by the university career service i should be getting interviews for the jobs i'm applying for with my CV. They said they had nothing to recommend I do. Frustrated I stupidly decided to do a masters thinking it would help me stand out more. But after two months i realise it is not for me. I'm jaded as fuck about the value of a degree and the quality of the course seemed suspect to me. I decided to quit straight away so i wouldn't have to pay any money, and phone my parents to let them know. Big mistake. We argue and when my mum asks what i'm going to do if i quit, i tell her ""get a job obviously"", the silence after was deafening. I argue back for maybe the first time in my life and end up hanging up the phone. Fast forward maybe 12 hours and my dad is in hospital due to his heart. I blame myself and i kind of shut down for 7 months. I dont quit uni, but i dont attend or do assignments and i struggle to get out of bed. Looking back i think this was what finally broke me. Years of feeling like want i want will hurt people because of my partner, and now there was my dad on a hospital bed, because i tried to put myself first, as solid evidence. After seven months of this i pick myself up somewhat, and manage to get a shitty job in retail i could have done whilst at school. I did get an interview for a job in London, but guess what, it just so happened to coincide with a family holiday in Australia we had been talking about for decades. I said i was happy to do the interview over Skype even if it was 3 am in Aussie, but they said no. The best part in all of this was when I asked for some feedback on why i got through to the interview stage. Their response read, ""You met the criteria for the job posting and was therefore offered an interview. WOW, so helpful.

Possible childhood trauma

My therapist also made me reconsider my childhood. My mum has bipolar and i never really thought about how it affected me until now. It's probably why I was too forgiving with my partner, ""its not her fault it's her mental health"". My upbringing might also explain why i struggle putting myself first, and believe i'm not worth anything. Growing up i felt like everyone else was more important than me. My mum obviously had her manic ups and downs, and was admitted to physic wards multiple times. My dad on the other hand had a stressful job and has always been overweight and even from a young age i worried about his health. My sister on the other hand would actually fight to have herself heard and argue back. Unfortunately i just saw this as adding more stress to my mum and dad. As a result, i would just sit there and agree to do whatever in order to keep the peace, as everyone else argued. There's also other little things that other people have said was bad. I broke my arm whilst at school and my mum didn't take me to hospital until three days later. Then there was the time i cut my leg with glass, and my mum again didn't take me to the hospital. My dad noticed the cut a few weeks later and took me to the hospital, but it was too late to get stitches. To be fair I got a badass scar out of it.

I never thought about how seeing my mum in multiple manic states affected me, but it's hard to ignore the fact it probably did. For example seeing her pace up and down muttering to herself probably didn't do my young mind any good. Might also explain why I've always leaned towards the anxious side of the spectrum.

Smaller stuff

\- My very first car broke after 2 weeks of purchase, dealer refused to repair or refund purchase. Took them to small claims court and spend an extra £135 which would be refunded if they were forced to pay. Court rules in my favor, they still don't pay and when the bailiffs go round to collect, they are in liquidation. I get none of my money back and the small legal fees i paid aren't refundable and were for nothing. (Further evidence that hard work and life is bullshit)

\- My best friend of over 20 yrs stabs me in the back. I open up to my friends about my depression and possible abuse by my partner on my birthday (Christmas eve). He decides to tell his fiance, who then tells my partner. Cue further guilt and feeling of being a piece of shit. I called him up on it and he says what i said wasnt very nice, so i end up apologising to him and his fiance, like the doormat i am. Then when i talked to him about it again recently he was way more understanding and said he saw it now. I told him i forgave him, but honestly i haven't and i'm not sure i will or even should.

Everyday I feel like a slave. Wake up early for work, go to school, do homework, maybe hang out with some friends and smoke weed. Rinse and repeat x1000000.

Shouldn’t we be focusing on exploring the ins and outs of the universe, and preserving our planet? I guess not, because humans are extremely selfish creatures.

I’m just so tired of everything. I barely have the energy to get out of bed most days and half ass everything I do. I have a therapist, and as much as I like him, he really isn’t helping. I feel like i’m stuck in this nihilistic mindset no matter what I do.

But I kept going. The only reason I did was because the few people I knew would miss me wouldn’t be able to handle my death. I couldn’t do that to them. I didn’t have the courage to betray them.

Today was even more different, a better kind of different. I woke up and felt.. good. A good that I hadn’t woke up feeling in years. A genuine excitement for the day. I drank my coffee and it tasted better than it normally did. I played music and danced around my room while I got dressed rather than the usual dragging myself around my room and throwing on a jacket I had worn everyday that week. 

As I walked through the halls, I felt a newly discovered confidence I didn’t know I possessed. My insecurities  weren’t hovering over me like a storm cloud. Minor inconveniences didn’t take a massive chunk out of my day. It was unbelievably relieving. 

I guess part of me just wanted to share this with someone. I couldn’t keep it to myself. But another part of me wanted to post it because there’s a chance it could help someone, anyone.

Mistakes I made, people I lost, and the utter loneliness and sadness that all of it has brought me.

Look at me. 2 years ago I had a good job, an incredible girlfriend who loved me no matter what, a healthy and happy home life where I lived with both of my parents despite their being divorced. I maintained happy relationships with the people around me and I was loving life. My girlfriend and I fit together like peas in a pod: We loved each other more than anything. Shit, we thought we were going to get fucking married. We were inseparable, and both friends our age and older adults alike agreed we made an excellent couple and a fantastic team, with maturity beyond our years. It was all good, the talks we used to have, being around each other, going to events together, the sex, I loved and cherished every single moment with her and she with me. We never disagreed, not because we are so similar that we couldn't, but because we would talk about what we were disagreeing on and work it out until we didn't disagree anymore. We never yelled, we never got angry at each other. It was stereotypical perfect love.

Things began to change. My girlfriend's dad's excessive drinking was having a real impact on her happiness, and thus, mine. I was bad at talking about my feelings, so I didn't have the words to tell her what was wrong. I thought that the thing making her sad was me, and so I tried to save her by breaking up with her. Less than a month after crushing her heart, I realized my mistake and begged to get back together and let me try to undo what wrong I had done. She considered it, but ultimately it was too late, and she had already moved on. 

Cut to now, two years later. I've moved out of my parent's house, ruining my relationship with my father in the process. My ex-girlfriend is still with the same guy that she ended up with after I left her. They've been together longer now than we were. It feels so stupid that I still miss her, considering our relationship was relatively short in the scheme of things. But god damn. I still miss her, and I still haven't forgiven myself for leaving her two years ago. I think about my mistake every day. I've been depressed ever since our relationship ended, and for over a year I quietly sobbed to myself every night. Two separate times, I put a gun to my head and began to squeeze the trigger. For almost a year, I had what you might call PTSD: I couldn't close my eyes without seeing her in my rear view mirror, standing in the street, head in her hands while she fucking sobbed her eyes out after I broke her heart. I looked back at that and I fucking drove away. I fucking drove away, when I could've gotten back out, hugged her, and just fucking opened my mouth and TALKED to the person I loved more than anything about what was wrong. I've never forgiven myself for that.

Now, I've replaced the crying with alcohol: I come home and start pouring whiskey most nights, more than most people my age. I'm not an alcoholic, by any means; I don't feel the NEED to do it, or even the compelling urge. I just hate the fact that I come home each night to an empty apartment with no pets (darn lease won't let me have them), no friends, no girlfriend or companion. Just darkness and the quiet click of my grandfather clock. And so I sit down, and I turn on a light, and I try to watch TV and find the will to eat, and when I finally find it inside me to get up and walk over to the refrigerator, I walk back with a can of reheated shit and a large glass of whiskey. And I just sit there and drink and eat and try not to think about how easy it would be to kill myself anytime I fucking wanted to. The whiskey helps to numb the overwhelming pain.

/Life story. My point is, my past is all I think about: I was happy, once, and I can't help but think about that every moment of my waking life. I can't stop thinking about my mistakes, I can't stop missing this person that I'm still in love with. But I also can't right the wrongs that got me here: I can't try again with this wonderful person, the likes of whom I have never found and might never find again. I haven't had another relationship since, apart from a near-meaningless one week fling with someone I knew from high school.

So I'm just posting here because Im feeling down. I don't have anywhere to escape to and I just want to put my thoughts down here. I hate school. I know, every student does in some way or another, but I really do. The only class I love is Art, where I get to do glassblowing, but I don't even get to do it that often, only 1-2 days a week for like an hour. I really enjoy that. I, on the other hand, pretty much hate all my classes and feel like I want to drop out. I hate home because I fight with my dad now almost always and my mom keeps trying to see what i'm doing and being nosy. I hate my brother because he always finds a way to hurt me emotionally and makes fun of me and what I'm wearing 24/7. I don't have any people I hangout with, even though I'm a super nice and empathetic guy and no one really talks to me inside school. I usually spend lunches hanging alone, and/or glassblowing. I don't really have anything to look forward to since my girlfriend is in another city and has very protective parents. I can't go over to her house at all and even see her during the week. 

A little backstory for you all that need it:

I became depressed in the middle of 8th grade and got addicted to painkillers. This continued up till 9th grade to where I did give up painkillers, but started cutting more and more. I kept it all inside because I was afraid that I was gonna be sent somewhere for kids like me. 4-5 months into 9th grade I snapped. I tried killing myself but couldn't bring myself to do it. I then turned to my mom, The only person I felt that I could turn to and talked to here for about 2 hours straight, which really helped. I was then taken to a hospital and put on a 72 hour hold where I thought about how I had been feeling (while being with other kids in the hospital who were going though what I was going though). I was diagnosed with clinical depression. I then got out and was put on antidepressants. I then went though the rest of the year finding the right dosage for me. I then dealt with some other tings and went to private school for 10th grade, which was fine and I felt great throughout the year, and even got off my anti-depressants. I'm not in 11th grade and I suspect my depression is coming back.

Okay, now back to what i was saying,

Yeah, so I cant see my girlfriend during the week. It really sucks since I love her dearly, but I don't want to talk to here about all of this because she would probably be scared away. I just don't really have a lot of options when It comes to life right now. If anyone has any advice or just want to say something nice, please do.

Thanks,

I’m 21/M, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Anxeity Disorder when I was 16 years old, but I obviously have been dealing with it since I was a pre-teen in middle school, but my family is sorta traditional and mostly uneducated, so they just thought I was just emotional boy. I was also diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder when I was 6 years old. 

I believe a lot of my problems stem from the lack of a stable father figure and a very overbearing and very religious mother who would hit me with all sorts of things when she was mildly upset with me. I was always the new kid because of how often mom would move. I’ve always been the bottom of the proverbial totem pole. I’ve always liked girls so I would try to ask girls out in middleschool and highschool but I’ve always been rejected. 

I’d like to believe that I’m not all that ugly. I’m at least a 7/10. I’m 6’2, I’m tan, I’ve been told I have very proportionate facial features, and I’m in pretty decent shape. I’d like to think that I’m kind, honest, patient and compassionate with others, I’d like to think that I’m at least a little more intelligent than average. I read quite a lot, and I love history, science, philosophy and music. I can also sing and play lots of instruments. However, dealing with rejection has played a central part in a lot of my emotional turmoil. I was in a few relationships in the past 4 years, but they usually all end the same way. They tell me it’s not my fault and just ghost me forever. I don’t get it. 

My father isn’t all that great either. I went many years as a child without seeing him, and any time he contacts me it’s for me to do a favor for him. I told him I wanted to see my grandfather in Brazil who was very sick and was going to die, but he went without me and I only found out that my grandpa died a few weeks after from Facebook. 

I’ve been on and off allllll sorts of different medications. Some didn’t even work, some worked a little too well and I would lose 20-30 lbs within a couple months. 

I’m currently on 300mg of Wellbutrin. I smoke a lot of THC now. They don’t help, but I feel nothing for several hours, so I guess that works.

I’ve attempted suicide twice. One time by hanging when I was 17, in which the hook I was hanging from in-fact broke off from my weight and I fell and I didn’t bother to try again and threw away the rope. The other time was by asphyxiation by CO in my garage roughly two months ago, where my current step father tore me out of the car when he woke up to get a snack. Almost as if God would like to keep me alive just to endure the pain for as long as I can until I drive myself into insanity. 

I’ve grown increasingly cynical and pessimistic with each misfortune that comes upon me. In the same year (this one) I’ve lost my car, my job, my financial aid for school, and my relationship. I got a new crummy car just to get me around now, which is a step up from vegetating in my room all day. The more my mental health deteriorates, the faster the things around me collapse. I usually just stay inside because at least not as many things can hurt me.

I was alone for four months and I fell for a girl about a month ago that I had been talking to. She’s perfect, but I told her my feelings and she doesn’t feel the same. The sting is heavy, and I feel all alone, I’m scared to attempt suicide now because I’m afraid to fail and mortally injure myself and I’ll either become paralyzed or die very painfully, which I would rather avoid. My track record for bad luck is pretty extensive.

The worst part is, my life is just good enough where I can’t complain to anyone except for faceless readers on Reddit who don’t read anything except for the tl;dr anyway. Therapy hasn’t worked, medicine doesn’t work. Exercise doesn’t work. Religion doesn’t work. Long walks in nature doesn’t work. I have a raincloud that follows me all the time and it worries my family and the people around me. At this point, I don’t care who cries over my death. Everyone just wants to hurt me anyways.

why do I even bother.

tl;dr: My life is fine. Which is my main gripe. I tried, I really have. But any of my attempts at happiness in myself is always crushed by people mistreating me.

The downside is that in my state, we bounce back and forth from summer to fall for about 2-3 months.

I'll say this, since I met my wife, my history of self mutilation and suicidal thoughts have significantly decreased. I've learned to convince myself that I don't hate my life and I don't want to die, I just hate how I feel. That said, having to remind myself that multiple times a day has gotten extremely exhausting.

Just like every year, I'm back to having the negative self talk in my head, dissociating a lot, random outbursts when I'm frustrated at myself for not being able to do something and random breakdowns where I cry until I feel numb. Food doesn't have a taste, music is just sound, shows on tv are just meaningless pictures, and I'm isolating myself because faking the smile and pretending everything is cool takes too much out of me. 

Between always being tired and malnourishment it's affecting my job. My stats have dropped significantly and when my manager has a coaching session with me, it ends with me beating myself up for not being better and crying for 10-15 minutes.

I guess I'm just venting here. If this isn't a good place to do it, please tell me and I'll delete my post.

But above everything, I just want to feel like me again. I want life to feel like there's a purpose again.

I&amp;#39;m 30 now and I&amp;#39;ve struggled with depression and anxiety since I was about 14. Never fails, once it starts to turn to fall, I hit a bottom. The downside is that in my state, we bounce back and forth from summer to fall for about 2-3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll say this, since I met my wife, my history of self mutilation and suicidal thoughts have significantly decreased. I&amp;#39;ve learned to convince myself that I don&amp;#39;t hate my life and I don&amp;#39;t want to die, I just hate how I feel.
